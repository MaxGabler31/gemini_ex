 Overview
We are a late clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on helping patients fight cancer with oncolytic viral immunotherapies. Our engineered viruses are designed to induce immunogenic death through direct viral-mediated cytotoxicity in cancer cells, thus releasing tumor neo-antigens and creating a pro-inflammatory microenvironment at the site of injection. Our approach combines an in-depth knowledge of viral immunotherapy with extensive clinical experience across a wide range of indications. Based on the broad range of data that we have generated from our preclinical models and clinical trials using our approach, we have observed what we believe to be systemic immune response against locally injected tumors and their distant metastases. We have established two oncolytic viral immunotherapy platforms based on novel, genetically modified adenovirus and herpes simplex virus (HSV) constructs. In our clinical results to date from CAN-2409, our lead product candidate from our adenovirus platform, and CAN-3110, our lead product candidate from our HSV platform, we have observed that these candidates may have the potential to address significant unmet patient need and improve clinical outcomes in novel indications across broader patient populations.

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we have observed monotherapy activity of CAN-2409 in a Phase 1 biomarker focused window of opportunity trial. In 2020, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating CAN-2409 in combination with PD-(L)1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with inadequate response to PD-(L)1 checkpoint inhibitors. This open label trial is targeting enrollment of approximately 96 patients with stage III/IV NSCLC in three separate cohorts. The cohorts are defined based on response to checkpoint inhibitors at the time of enrollment. Patients will continue treatment with their initial checkpoint inhibitor and CAN-2409 will be added to their regimen. The primary efficacy endpoint for this trial is response rate measured by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) and we expect to report safety and initial clinical activity in the second quarter of 2022.
 
We are also evaluating CAN-2409 in newly diagnosed high-grade glioma. The FDA has granted CAN-2409 fast track designation for use in this setting in combination with standard of care surgery and chemoradiation. We intend to initiate a potential registrational Phase 3 trial in this indication in the middle of 2022.
 Our most advanced product candidate, CAN-2409, is an off-the-shelf adenovirus product candidate (intended to be available as needed via prescription) combined with the prodrug valacyclovir that has generated promising clinical activity across a range of solid tumor indications, including our lead indication of prostate cancer. We are currently conducting, as part of our most advanced CAN-2409 program, a Phase 3 clinical trial in the United States under a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for CAN-2409 in patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer who have an intermediate- or high-risk for progression. We completed enrollment for this trial in September 2021 and we expect a final data readout in 2024.
In addition, we are advancing development of our HSV platform product candidates for solid tumor indications. Our lead HSV product candidate, CAN-3110, is currently in an ongoing investigator-initiated Phase 1 clinical trial in our initial target indication of recurrent high-grade glioma, and we reported additional biomarker results in November 2021. We are also designing novel candidates based on our HSV platform for the treatment of solid tumors.
Our oncolytic viral immunotherapy approach utilizes intratumoral administration of genetically engineered viruses to selectively induce tumor cell death and elicit an innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune response. Local delivery enables us to achieve these effects while aiming to minimize systemic toxicity. The immune cells induced by these viral immunotherapies are believed to target patients’ specific tumor antigens, potentially improving responses in immunologically “hot” tumors while at the same time infiltrating the tumor microenvironment, transforming non-inflamed “cold” tumors with limited immune response into “hot” tumors. In our data from our clinical studies in patients with cancer, we have observed increases in the expression of immune checkpoints PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4 following treatment with CAN-2409 supporting the evaluation of combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) such as anti-PD-(L)1 that, typically, are only efficacious in patients with immunologically “hot” tumors. While our product candidates are administered directly into the tumor, we have observed systemic immune response in our preclinical studies and clinical trials that may indicate the potential of CAN-2409 and CAN-3110 to induce systemic immune response against distal, uninjected tumors, also known as an “abscopal” effect.
We believe oncolytic viral immunotherapy is among the most promising cancer treatment modalities today. Treatment with oncolytic viral immunotherapy has already been clinically validated through talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic, Amgen), the first FDA-approved intratumoral oncolytic virus. Our goal is to further improve patient outcomes from oncolytic viral immunotherapies by selecting the optimal vector, specific transgenes and clinical indications for each
   tumor type while optimizing product candidate attributes, such as high-titer formulation, intratumoral administration, and storage conditions that could potentially lower logistical barriers for patients and clinicians.

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, a global pandemic, or the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and worldwide. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments that cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and actions taken by government authorities and businesses to contain or prevent the further spread of COVID-19. For instance, a recurrence or continuation of COVID-19 cases, including new variants, could cause a more widespread or severe impact on commercial activity depending on where infection rates are highest. If we or any of the third parties with whom we engage were to experience any additional shutdowns or other prolonged business disruptions as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially or negatively affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 We have been carefully monitoring the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business and have taken important steps to help ensure the safety of our employees and their families and to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We have established a flexible work policy for all employees under which we encourage all of our employees to work from the office or home as they feel appropriate. Those employees performing or supporting business-critical operations, such as certain members of our laboratory and facilities staff are working on site on a daily basis. For those employees, who come to work at our facility, we have implemented stringent safety measures designed to comply with applicable federal, state and local guidelines instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also maintained efficient communication with our partners and clinical sites during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have taken these precautionary steps while maintaining business continuity so that we can continue to make progress on our programs. While we have experienced delays in enrollment and site closures at certain of our third-party clinical trial sites, these delays have not had a material impact on our development timelines for our product candidates. We will continue to monitor developments as we address the disruptions and uncertainties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. See the “Risk Factors” section for a discussion of the potential adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Our Pipeline
We have an advanced pipeline comprised of seven clinical trials based on our two lead product candidates, CAN-2409 and CAN-3110. In addition, we own exclusive development and commercial rights for our product candidates in major territories including the United States, Europe and Asia.
Our pipeline is set forth below:


   CAN-2409, formerly known as gene mediated cytotoxic immunotherapy, or GMCI, is our most advanced product candidate. It is a replication deficient adenovirus that has been genetically modified to encode the enzyme thymidine kinase. This enzyme activates an orally administered prodrug, valacyclovir, a widely available, generally well-tolerated antiviral at the site of the tumor, generating a powerful patient-specific anti-tumor immune response. We believe there are three key aspects of the mechanism of action. First, the direct, cellular killing activity is based on the transformation of valacyclovir into a toxic nucleotide analogue that disrupts DNA synthesis and repair. This phenomenon occurs preferentially in actively dividing cancer cells, thereby providing tumor specificity. This DNA repair inhibition is also hypothesized to be the mechanistic explanation behind the encouraging pre-clinical and clinical activity of CAN-2409 in combination with radiotherapy, a treatment known to cause DNA breaks requiring repair for continued cellular survival. Second, adenoviral capsid proteins themselves also directly trigger an immunologic response through the establishment of a proinflammatory tumor microenvironment, releasing important cytokines such as GM-CSF and IL-6. We believe this contributes to the potent activation of the patient’s own immune system that plays a critical role in the CAN-2409 mechanism of action. Finally, the localized death of tumor cells releases numerous antigens that can be recognized by the patient’s own immune system, thereby training the immune system to target and destroy similar cancer cells that have spread to other sites in the body.
CAN-2409 has been administered to over 700 patients with cancer to date, over 500 of whom are in ongoing, placebo-controlled randomized trials. In total, we have conducted more than 10 clinical trials with CAN-2409 in a range of solid tumor indications. We have seen encouraging clinical activity and a favorable tolerability profile with CAN-2409 in both monotherapy and combination settings with radiotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), chemotherapy and surgery. Based on the totality of our clinical data generated to date, we are currently pursuing indications in lung, pancreatic, brain, and prostate cancer, which we believe all have great potential to address unmet need.
In NSCLC, we have observed monotherapy activity of CAN-2409 in a Phase 1 biomarker focused, window of opportunity trial. In 2020, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating CAN-2409 in combination with PD-(L)1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with inadequate response to PD-(L)1 checkpoint inhibitors. This open label trial is targeting enrollment of approximately 96 patients with stage III/IV NSCLC in three separate cohorts. The cohorts are defined based on response to checkpoint inhibitors at the time of enrollment. Cohort 1 addresses patients with stable disease. Cohort 2 enrolls patients with progressive disease after at least 18 weeks of checkpoint treatment. Cohort 3 enrolls patients whose tumors are refractory to checkpoint therapy, with progressive disease observed at their first evaluation. Patients will continue treatment with their initial checkpoint inhibitor and CAN-2409 will be added to their regimen. The primary efficacy endpoint for this trial is response rate measured by RECIST, and we expect to report safety and initial clinical activity in the second quarter of 2022.
 We have also completed a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating CAN-2409 in patients with high-grade glioma. Our results demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival of approximately 3.6 months over standard of care alone (17.1 months versus 13.5 months, p=0.0417) in the overall trial population of high-grade glioma. Additionally, in a pre-specified subgroup of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma who underwent gross total surgical resection, a procedure consisting of the removal of more than 95% of the tumor, an improvement of overall survival of approximately 8.8 months over standard of care alone was demonstrated (25.1 months versus 16.3 months, p=0.0120). We are currently planning a Phase 3 trial in this indication and anticipate commencement in the middle of 2022. CAN-2409 has also received Fast Track designation for use in combination with standard of care surgery and chemoradiation to improve overall survival in adults with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. We have also received Orphan drug designation for the use of CAN-2409 for treatment of malignant brain tumors, including high-grade glioma. In addition, we have established a clinical collaboration with both Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) and the Adult Brain Tumor Consortium (ABTC), a National Cancer Institute funded cooperative group of leading brain cancer centers that facilitates the execution of novel, early-stage trials at some of the leading brain cancer treatment centers. This collaboration has provided support for our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in high-grade glioma patients, testing the combination of CAN-2409 and nivolumab (Opdivo, BMS). We anticipate reporting safety and initial efficacy data from this trial by the end of 2022.
We are conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial with CAN-2409 under agreement with the FDA through the SPA process in newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer in intermediate- and certain high-risk patients in combination with the standard of care that comprises radiotherapy and optional ADT. Our SPA provides FDA concurrence that our key endpoints and specific critical elements of our trial design are adequate to support a future marketing application if, among other things, we achieve the primary endpoint in the trial. The clinical trial is randomized, triple-blinded and placebo-controlled. It targeted enrollment of approximately 700 patients and was fully enrolled in September 2021 with final data readout anticipated in 2024. We have also received Fast Track designation by the FDA for the development of CAN-2409 for the treatment of localized, primary prostate cancer in combination with radiotherapy to improve the local control rate, decrease recurrence and improve disease-free survival. We expect that if the trial is successful and if we obtain FDA approval, CAN-2409 could be the first new FDA approved pharmacologic treatment available in over 30
   years as a first line therapeutic for the over 100,000 patients who are newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer each year in the United States.
We have also completed enrollment for a Phase 2 clinical trial with CAN-2409 as monotherapy in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients under active surveillance. This trial has recruited 187 patients with low-, intermediate- and certain high-risk localized prostate cancer. We expect to announce top line data in 2023. We believe that this trial, if successful, could position CAN-2409 as a first line monotherapy treatment of patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer, thereby meaningfully expanding the addressable patient population.
Our second oncolytic viral immunotherapy platform is based on a novel, next generation, genetically modified HSV that induces tumor specific oncolysis. The HSV platform enables generation of both replication-competent and replication-deficient viral product candidates as well as capacity to clone, in the vector, up to five transgenes that will allow us to optimize our virus profile for different tumor settings. CAN-3110, our first HSV product candidate, has been engineered for enhanced specificity and tumor cell killing, while minimizing toxicity on healthy tissue. CAN-3110 was formerly known as rQNestin34.5v.2. An investigator-initiated Phase 1 clinical trial is ongoing with CAN-3110 in our initial target indication of recurrent high-grade glioma and we reported additional biomarker results in November 2021. Based on the molecular targeting of CAN-3110, we believe that it could be evaluated in an expanded range of indications in the future, such as other neurologic tumors, melanoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, thyroid tumors and breast cancer. In addition, we are pursuing novel solid tumor discovery programs based on our HSV platform.
Corporate History and Our Team and Investors
We were incorporated in Delaware in June 2003 as Advantagene, Inc. (Advantagene). Advantagene was built on a strong scientific foundation and developed CAN-2409 over years of research and development. In December 2019, Advantagene acquired substantially all the assets of Periphagen and in September 2020, licensed CAN-3110 from MGB. Following the combination of Advantagene with the HSV discovery platform assets acquired from Periphagen, a company focused on engineering HSV as a gene therapy vector, we formally changed our name to Candel Therapeutics, Inc. in December 2020.
We were founded and are now led by a team of renowned drug developers, oncolytic viral immunotherapy experts, oncologists, immunologists and biotech business leaders.
▪Paul Peter Tak, M.D., Ph.D., FMedSci. Dr. Tak, our President and CEO, joined us in September 2020 and most recently served as President and CEO of Kintai Therapeutics, which later merged with Senda Bioscience.

 Our Strengths
We believe our experience and capabilities in oncolytic viral immunotherapy will bring significant benefit to cancer patients who are underserved by the current standard of care, particularly in prostate and brain cancer. We believe our key strengths are:
▪Deep clinical and development experience in innovative oncolytic viral immunotherapy. We are leveraging more than 20 years of development history, and have deployed our lead product candidate CAN-2409 in a range of oncology indications. These efforts have generated extensive clinical data in hundreds of patients and has driven our current development focus. We continue to leverage this depth of clinical data to select new indications of interest and to efficiently execute on our clinical development strategy. We are currently developing our two product candidates in seven clinical trials. 
 ▪Two potentially registrational trials for our CAN-2409 programs in localized prostate and high-grade glioma, indications with significant unmet need supported by its safety and tolerability profile and encouraging Phase 2 data.
▪Localized prostate cancer: Current therapeutic options for early treatment of localized prostate cancer are limited and generally characterized by poor tolerability. A significant proportion of patients experience disease progression after receiving standard of care treatment. Based on our Phase 2 trial, intermediate-risk patients receiving CAN-2409 demonstrated failure rates which were 75% lower than the outcomes reported in four large, contemporaneous clinical trials in patients with comparable disease status who were treated with similar radiotherapy protocols, although this is limited because we have not conducted head-to-head studies. Based on the strength of this Phase 2 data, we are currently conducting a Phase 3 potentially registrational trial in localized prostate cancer under an SPA agreement with the FDA and expect a final data readout in 2024. 
 ▪High-grade glioma: There is presently a large unmet need in the first line patient population with current treatment options, such as temozolomide, demonstrating an overall survival benefit of only 2.5 months over radiotherapy alone. In our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma, we compared the administration of CAN-2409 combined with standard of care to the effects of standard of care alone. In this overall population, we demonstrated a statistically significant increase in median overall survival (mOS) of 17.1 months compared to 13.5 months observed in the standard of care arm. We believe that the beneficial effect of CAN-2409 can be further improved in the context of a precision medicine approach based on the pre-specified subgroup of patients with glioblastoma whose surgery achieved a gross total resection. In this population, CAN-2409 with standard of care demonstrated a mOS of 25.1 months compared to 16.3 months in the standard of care arm. We are pursuing this precision strategy and expect to commence our Phase 3 potentially registrational clinical trial in high-grade glioma in the middle of 2022. 
 ▪Phase 2 trial of CAN-2409 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have become standard of care in NSCLC. However, a majority of patients ultimately progress on these treatments. New treatment options that improve the number of patients who respond and that increase the durability of these responses are urgently needed. We have an ongoing Phase 2 trial that combines CAN-2409 with immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with NSCLC and expect safety and initial efficacy data by the end of 2022. 
 ▪Two oncolytic viral immunotherapy platforms provide versatility and optionality to pursue a range of solid tumor indications. With our clinical stage engineered adenovirus and HSV platforms, we can 

   approach indications of interest through multiple modalities, expanding our potential to address patients in areas with high unmet need. For example, we are currently conducting clinical trials in two different brain cancer indications with product candidates engineered from our adenovirus and HSV platforms, CAN-2409 and CAN-3110, respectively.
▪Attractive commercial profile and ownership of our programs. For each investigational product, there is an opportunity to expand into new indications ('pipeline in a product'). We currently own development and commercialization rights for our programs in major markets, including the United States, Europe and Asia, allowing us to control development and seek approval in those areas as we prepare our commercialization efforts. 
 ▪Manufacturing strategy. We expect that our cost-of-goods will be substantially lower than cell- and antibody-based therapies because of our high-yield manufacturing process. We plan to manufacture our therapeutics for commercialization using third-party manufacturers. 
 Our Strategy
Our goal is to develop best-in-class oncolytic viral immunotherapies to transform the lives of cancer patients. We plan to develop and commercialize our two lead product candidates, CAN-2409 and CAN-3110, for the treatment of a broad range of solid tumor indications, while continuing to build our pipeline through our discovery platform. Key elements of our strategy include the following:
▪Advance the late stage development of, and seek regulatory approval for, our lead product candidate, CAN-2409, in newly diagnosed, localized prostate cancer. We are currently conducting a potentially registrational Phase 3 clinical trial in intermediate- and high-risk patients in combination with the standard of care, radiotherapy. If approved, we believe CAN-2409 could be a first-in-class drug for localized prostate cancer patients with the potential to reduce disease progression and recurrence. 
 ▪Advance the development of, and seek regulatory approval for, CAN-2409 in both monotherapy and combination therapy for high-grade glioma. We have completed a Phase 2 clinical trial that showed a statistically significant overall survival benefit of approximately 8.8 months in first line glioblastoma patients who underwent gross total resection. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 trial employing a precision medicine approach in this indication in the middle of 2022. We have also entered into a collaboration with BMS and ABTC for a Phase 1b clinical trial in high-grade glioma patients testing the combination of CAN-2409 and nivolumab (Opdivo, BMS), with safety and initial efficacy data expected by the end of 2022. 
 ▪Advance the clinical development of CAN-3110, an oncolytic HSV with tumor-specific enhanced replication potency. An investigator-initiated Phase 1 clinical trial is ongoing in recurrent glioblastoma with additional biomarker data received in November 2021. This trial will evaluate the activity of CAN-3110 in later stage disease, where we believe a replicating virus may present therapeutic advantages. 
 ▪Advance the development of CAN-2409 in patients with inadequate responses to standard of care immune checkpoint inhibitors. A phase 2 trial that evaluates CAN-2409 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors is currently underway, with initial data from this open label trial expected in the second quarter of 2022.
 ▪Continue to expand the development of CAN-2409 in other solid tumor indications, such as pancreatic cancer. We believe we can leverage our broad clinical experience to expand the development of CAN-2409 in other indications. We have initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with advanced non-metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Our experience in these indications may enable us to expand in the future into other indications. 
 ▪Leverage our HSV oncolytic viral immunotherapy platform to develop additional HSV product candidates. Our platform enables rapid vector engineering and generation of new candidates. Key attributes of HSV that allow targeted modifications to the virus are high capacity for genetic cargo, and the ability of our platform to generate both replication incompetent and competent agents depending on the demands of a particular application. 
 ▪Develop strategic partnerships to maximize the value of our current and future product candidates. In order to advance treatment options for a large number of patients, we may partner with other companies with complementary resources to maximize the value of our current and future product candidates. Such partnerships may allow us to pair CAN-2409, CAN-3110 and our future product candidates with other novel agents owned by strategic partners. Partnerships may also help realize the full potential of our product candidates in markets where we are unlikely to pursue development or commercialization on our own. We intend to maintain significant economic interest in our product candidates and selectively consider partnership opportunities. 

   ▪Develop commercial scale manufacturing of CAN-2409 at a contract manufacturer and complete our planned cGMP manufacturing facility for the manufacture of CAN-3110. We will rely on third party contract manufacturers for commercial scale manufacturing of our adenovirus product candidate, CAN-2409. We expect to develop clinical scale, fully integrated manufacturing capabilities at our facility in Needham, Massachusetts for clinical trial product supplies. 
 Our Market Opportunities in Localized Prostate Cancer, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and High-Grade Glioma
The three indications where we have the most advanced clinical trials are localized prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and high-grade glioma. These types of cancer present substantial market opportunities.
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States. The prostate cancer therapy market is estimated to be approximately $9.9 billion in 2019 growing to over $16.1 billion by 2026. Although most deaths occur in patients with later stage metastatic disease, the majority of prostate cancer patients roughly 150,000 annually in the United States are initially diagnosed in the early stage of disease. Standard of care in this early, localized setting, leaves substantial need unaddressed. The primary interventions are surgery, radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy, also known as chemical castration. These treatments have high incidence of potentially life altering side effects, including incontinence and erectile dysfunction. There is therefore a significant unmet need for a novel treatment able to forestall or prevent progression to later stages of disease without the burdensome side effects associated with the current standard of care.
In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), specifically PD-1 directed agents, have transformed the treatment paradigm of NSCLC and become a backbone therapy for this indication. Over a half dozen immune checkpoint inhibitor products have been approved in a number of cancer indications, and there are numerous other related drug candidates in preclinical and clinical development. Global sales for ICIs in 2019 were approximately $23 billion with NSCLC, accounting for between 50% and 55% of overall sales. The commercial opportunity in NSCLC is significant. Drug treated patient populations in the US for 2020 are estimated at 75,160; 47,920 and 21,990 in first-, second- and third-line treatment, respectively. ICI use in NSCLC has become standard of care with approximately 49% of first-line patients in the United States being treated with an ICI alone or in combination with other agents.
 Glioblastoma is the most common form of brain cancer, comprising approximately 90% of high-grade gliomas, and has an extremely poor prognosis. Fewer than 10% of patients survive longer than 5 years, with a median overall survival of less than 15 months. The primary standard of care treatments are surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. None of these treatments offer the potential of a cure, with nearly all patients eventually succumbing to their cancer. While the annual number of drug-treatable patients with glioblastoma in the United States is approximately 16,000, limited treatment options and the substantial unmet need present a significant market opportunity. One illustrative example is the agent temozolomide, which demonstrated improvement in median overall survival of less than three months compared to standard of care, yet still generated peak annual revenue of over $1 billion.
Our Approach
Conventional cancer therapies (chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery) often do not eradicate 100% of the tumor cells, which often leads to tumor progression or recurrence. Deep and durable responses, therefore, are still elusive for many cancer patients. Traditionally, surgery and/or radiotherapy are used for local tumor debulking whereas chemotherapeutic agents target systemic eradication of tumor cells. These treatment modalities, however, are often limited by toxicity.
Immunotherapy is a relatively new treatment modality that has expanded the anti-cancer treatment paradigm. FDA-approved immunotherapies include cytokines, cell therapies and antibodies, including checkpoint inhibitors. Much focus has been placed on harnessing the effector T cell arm of the immune system for tumor specific immunity. Adoptive T cell therapy has shown positive results but with limited activity in solid tumors, and is not scalable for widespread use. Vaccine approaches range in complexity from peptide antigens to autologous or allogeneic tumor cell products. The advantage of the single antigen approaches is that they can be easily manufactured and produced, however, they have the fundamental disadvantage of being potentially irrelevant for a patient’s specific tumor or immune system or easily bypassed by resistant clones. Cellular vaccines are not easily scalable and allogeneic vaccines may not bear the relevant antigens expressed by a patient’s tumor. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, or ICI, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies, have transformed the treatment paradigm for different cancer indications. However, only approximately 15 to 40% of patients overall respond to such treatment.
We are focused on the development of oncolytic viral immunotherapy approaches, which are based on an extensive history of research. Originally, the mechanism of action of those agents was believed to be based only on the ability of the virus to induce cancer cell lysis and to resolve tumors. Later, it was demonstrated that viral immunotherapy may induce immunogenic cell death. This effect may be enhanced by the pro-inflammatory effects of the viral capsid proteins. With the dramatic emergence of ICIs and immunotherapy as a core treatment modality, the importance of the immunostimulatory aspect of viral-mediated approaches became more widely evident. The currently understood
   generalized mechanism of action of oncolytic viral immunotherapies is unique in combining both an anti-tumor cytotoxic component and an immune-stimulatory component. Together, these modalities lead to an “in-situ vaccination” effect against the injected tumor followed by an effect on uninjected distant metastases.
Pairing this therapeutic approach with ICI treatment is based on a strong mechanistic rationale and has shown promise in experimental models of cancer. It has been observed that tumors that are least responsive to ICI are commonly characterized by low levels of lymphocytic infiltration and low or no PD-L1 expression levels; they are referred to as “cold” tumors. One of our areas of focus is the conversion of immunologically suppressed “cold” tumors into immunologically active “hot” tumors, thereby increasing their responsiveness to ICI.
Specific aspects of the mechanism of action of viral immunotherapy include the following:
Direct anti-tumor cytotoxic activity. Tumor specific viral mediated oncolysis is achieved by both precise delivery of the engineered virus to the tumor as well as the virus’ ability to selectively replicate within a cancer cell. Various approaches have been applied in different programs to increase the specificity and potency of viral toxicity aimed at tumor cells, including genetic modifications and use of prodrugs.
Broad stimulation of anti-tumor immunity. The immunogenic cell death driven by oncolysis results in a potent local and systemic immune stimulation with the increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules. This, in turn, promotes the activation of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system in the presence of highly immunogenic viral components. This broad response commonly includes recruitment and activation of antigen-presenting cells and effector immune cells to the site of the tumor.
Priming of the immune system against tumor antigens. The lysis of cancer cells leads to the exposure of tumor-specific antigens. This early effect, combined with intratumoral immune cell infiltration and activation, leads to antigen presentation and initiation of a local adaptive immune response targeted against a set of tumor antigens expressed by the patient’s cancer cells.
Development of a systemic immune memory response. Viral immunotherapy induces the development of a long-lasting systemic immune surveillance against the antigens associated with the injected tumor, and consequently, tumor antigens expressed at metastatic sites. This, leads to a cytotoxic immune response against the distant tumor cells, also known as an abscopal effect.
Desirable clinical properties. Viral immunotherapy has attributes that are important for a cancer therapeutic. The agents are off-the-shelf, and while they have been shown to stimulate immune responses in certain patients, there is no requirement to modify them for each patient, unlike other cellular therapy approaches. The first viral immunotherapy (Imlygic, Amgen) was approved by the FDA in 2015, providing support that additional agents in this class may have similar potential. Furthermore, safety data shown in the clinical trials and the ultimate approval of Imlygic, supports the ability to combine viral immunotherapy with other agents due to the potential for fewer overlapping side effects.
Our Product Candidates: Two platforms and two clinical candidates to address diverse clinical needs
Our two platforms, one based on adenovirus and the other based on HSV, provide different and complementary sets of attributes, which allows us to utilize the product candidate that is best suited for a particular clinical application.
Key attributes across our oncolytic viral immunotherapy platforms include:
▪Targeting a Wide Range of Cell Types. Product candidates from both the HSV and adenoviral platforms can transduce a diverse range of cell types, which we believe will allow us to address many different forms of cancer. 
 ▪Off-the-Shelf Product. A standardized product intended to be available as needed via prescription supports straightforward clinical administration, simplified manufacturing and supply chain management. 
 ▪Intratumoral Route of Administration. Both of our product candidates are administered by direct injection into the tumor site. This aims to maximize immune stimulation and minimize systemic toxicity, factors that are believed to be suboptimal with intravenous administration. For the indications that we selected, this is a straightforward procedure, leveraging standard of care medical procedures, such as intra-prostate injection or delivery during diagnostic (bronchoscopy) or therapeutic (neurosurgery) procedures. 
 ▪Cost-efficient Manufacturing. Both product candidates are relatively inexpensive to manufacture, particularly when compared to other biologic or cellular therapy treatments. We believe that there are several qualified contract manufacturers with experience manufacturing adenovirus and HSV products.
 Key attributes of our Adenoviral platform include:
▪Targeting a Wide Range of Cell Types. Adenoviruses can efficiently transduce cells from different lineages. This allows us to apply this platform to many different tumor types. 

   ▪Immunogenic Virus Particle. The adenoviral virus particles are strong simulators of the innate immune system, a property that contributes to immune activation at the site of administration. 
 ▪High-Titer Formulation. Adenovirus can be formulated at high titers, facilitating the administration of low volume doses sufficiently potent to induce strong activity, particularly in volume sensitive indications such as brain cancer. 
 ▪Product Stability. The formulation deployed in clinical trials has stability at refrigerator temperatures (4°C), supporting use at less specialized and therefore widely accessible sites such as community-based private clinics. 
 ▪Non-Replicating Design. Engineering the adenovirus to remove replication ability reduces the potential for viral shedding, something which is particularly important in clinical applications such as prostate cancer. There is no need for in vivo amplification as the virus is highly immunogenic and can be administered at high titers. 
 Key Attributes of our HSV platform include:
▪Amenable to Engineered Modifications. Our knowledge of virus biology allows us to make modifications, such as those already present in CAN-3110 to target certain tumor types. The tumor specific replication ability of CAN-3110 is regulated by the expression of ICP34.5, a gene encoding for a protein that permits viral replication even in the presence of the interferon response that is normally able to quell viral infection. In the CAN-3110 construct, ICP34.5 expression is driven in gliomas, but not in healthy brain tissue, thereby enabling replication specifically in the context of brain tumors. We believe our HSV platform will allow us to implement additional genetic modifications to leverage the use of CAN-3110 in high-grade glioma and in other tumor types. 
 ▪Capacity for Replication. There is a strong rationale for use of a replication-competent virus that is designed to provide potent oncolysis and in vivo virus amplification in high tumor volume or less anatomically accessible tumors, such as recurrent high-grade glioma. 
 ▪Lower Immunostimulatory Potency. The engineered HSV viral particle is able to persist and replicate at the site of the tumor. This is particularly important in larger tumors formed in immune privileged, highly immunosuppressive sites; supporting the use of CAN-3110 in recurrent high-grade glioma. 
 ▪High Capacity for Genetic Cargos. Our HSV platform allows the introduction of large genetic cargos, such as multiple immunomodulatory genes that may further enhance the anti-tumor immune response. 
 Our Lead Product Candidate: CAN-2409
We believe the adenovirus-based CAN-2409 has advantageous properties that differentiate from other viral immunotherapies. Namely, CAN-2409:
▪Has shown activity in a range of solid tumor types and in late-stage clinical trials.
▪Has been dosed in hundreds of patients and has shown a favorable tolerability profile.
▪Is engineered to be potently immunogenic but non-replicating with the goal of maximizing the immune response while minimizing the risk for local and systemic toxicity.
▪Can be stored at 4°C, facilitating the use of CAN-2409 in out-patient clinics. This aspect is particularly favorable in indications such as prostate cancer, where patients are often monitored in individual private practices. 
 CAN-2409 (international non-proprietary name: aglatimagene besadenovec) is an adenovirus-based replication-deficient engineered gene construct encoding the thymidine kinase gene derived from the herpes simplex virus. It is injected directly into the tumor or target tissue. Localized injection is intended to minimize systemic toxicities associated with systemic intravenous administration, eliminating the requirement for complex immune evasion or tumor-specific targeting mechanisms, and focuses the immune response locally against the tumor, while also activating the desired systemic anti-tumoral response. The adenoviral construct is used as a vector to transport the thymidine kinase gene into the tumor cells at the site of injection. Thymidine kinase converts generic, FDA-approved anti-herpes drugs, such as ganciclovir, acyclovir and valacyclovir, which we use as prodrugs, into a toxic nucleotide analogue. These agents are widely available, inexpensive and are generally well-tolerated. Cells transduced with thymidine kinase gene undergo immunogenic cell death after exposure to these systemically administered prodrugs.
   The prodrug-derived cytotoxic nucleotide analogs are designed to inhibit DNA replication and repair, leading to the death of multiplying tumor cells, and in particular of cells undergoing repair from radiation or chemotherapy damage. This oncolytic activity is immunogenic and exposes tumor antigens that can elicit a further tumor-specific immune response. Additionally, the virus itself stimulates a marked immune response.
CAN-2409: Mechanism of action - local immune activation

   
Key pro-inflammatory cytokines such as GM-CSF and IL-6 as well as chemokines, adhesion molecules and costimulatory molecules are locally upregulated, resulting in an inflamed (hot) tumor microenvironment, able to further enhance T cell activation.
This local effect provides a strong mechanistic rationale for the combination of oncolytic viral immunotherapy with T cell checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-1 or PD-L1 targeting antibodies. ICI agents work by unmasking the inhibitory signals provided by PD-L1 ligands on tumor cells when bound to PD-1 receptors on T cells. By blocking this suppressive signal pharmacologically, it has been demonstrated that T cells can be unleashed to attack cancer cells and that profound clinical benefit can be achieved, but this benefit accrues only to a minority of patients. It has been hypothesized that treatment results can be significantly improved by optimizing recognition of the specific tumor antigens by the patient’s adaptive immune system using oncolytic viral immunotherapy combined with the non-specific stimulation of T cells induced by ICI treatment. It appears that a duality of signals is required: releasing the checkpoint inhibition as described earlier, coupled with the provision of a positive, stimulatory signal to T cells. The efficient presentation of tumor specific antigens by MHC class I molecules to the immune system provides just such a specific, stimulatory signal. Oncolytic viral immunotherapies have been shown to facilitate such cross presentation of tumor antigens and are therefore an attractive complement to PD-1 or PD-L1 checkpoint blockade.
The immune system is highly dynamic, with continuous trafficking of different populations of immune cells throughout the body. One outcome of this is that when T cells are locally activated against tumor-specific antigens, they can act systemically to drive an efficient immune response at sites distant from the original tumor, as is illustrated schematically in the figure above. This abscopal effect may explain the significant effects observed at distant, uninjected sites demonstrated in experimental model of cancers. Abscopal effect has been shown with CAN-2409 in a mouse model of prostate cancer. The model employed RM-1, a syngeneic prostate cell line, that was implanted both in the flanks of the mice as well as systemic, via a tail vein injection to mimic metastatic disease, resulting in the emergence of lung tumor nodules. After intratumor treatment of the flank tumor masses with either CAN-2409 and systemic prodrug, alone or in combination with radiotherapy, we observed a beneficial response in both injected and uninjected metastatic tumor. Use
   of CAN-2409 resulted in a 38% mean reduction in tumor volume and, in the combination arm, a reduction of 61% in tumor volume. Notably, the number of lung nodules was reduced from 20.5 in the control arm and 22.4 in the mice that received radiotherapy to 13.0 in the CAN-2409 arm, to 6.6 when CAN-2409 was combined with radiotherapy.
CAN-2409 treatment teaches the immune system how to fight cancer in injected tumor and uninjected metastases
   
The activity of CAN-2409 treatment has been shown to be dependent on CD8+ T cell involvement in mouse studies that evaluated permutations of CAN-2409 treatment and T cell depletion. In the figure below, experimental data show that in mice bearing AKR flank xenografts that were treated with CAN-2409 and prodrug, significant tumor growth inhibition was observed. In contrast, mice treated with the prodrug and a negative control vector showed significantly less tumor growth inhibition, providing evidence that the specific adenoviral construct of CAN-2409 is a key factor in anti-tumor activity. Moreover, when two additional arms were treated as just described but with the addition of an antibody that depleted CD8+ T cells, very little tumor growth inhibition was observed. This supports the contention that the activity of CAN-2409 treatment is directly dependent on CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, T cells from mice that were successfully treated with CAN-2409 and prodrug were shown to be sufficient to inhibit tumor growth when mixed with AKR tumor model cells and implanted subcutaneously in mouse flanks. This activity was not observed with T cells from untreated mice, from mice that were treated with a control vector that lacked the thymidine kinase gene, or when the AKR tumor cells were xenografted alone. These data are consistent with a T cell dependent mechanism of action of CAN-2409.

   CAN-3110 and the HSV platform technology
CAN-3110 is a modified HSV with specific properties that can be leveraged in diverse clinical indications. Namely, CAN-3110:
▪Is engineered to provide oncolysis through tumor replication specifically in Nestin expressing cancer cells.
▪Has demonstrated statistically significant survival benefit in preclinical models of brain cancer.
▪Has demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile, not reaching a dose limiting toxicity in the dose range tested in our Phase 1 trial. 
 ▪Has shown a preliminary clinical signal in a difficult to treat brain cancer population, critically defined by a highly immunosuppressive environment. 
 ▪Has been engineered to replicate in a range of other indications characterized by Nestin expression. 
 ▪Is derived from the HSV platform that also provides the potential to support expansion of our pipeline with novel agents.
CAN-3110 is an engineered oncolytic HSV where the expression of ICP34.5, the gene responsible for viral replication, has been placed under the control of a tumor-specific Nestin promoter. This modification of the viral genome enables us to maintain the function of ICP34.5, an HSV protein that allows virus replication even in the presence of a suppressive interferon response, under a strict control and only in tumor cells.
ICP34.5 is often deleted in other HSV oncolytic viruses that may be less tumor selective with an intent of achieving favorable safety profile, but this often results in weak viruses characterized by poor replication ability and an ability to generate limited immune response.
Nestin is a cytoskeletal protein that is overexpressed in glioma cells, but it is absent in the healthy adult brain. In CAN-3110, ICP34.5 expression is controlled by the Nestin promotor enabling viral replication selectively in tumor cells. This replication-competent HSV construct provides tumor-specific cytolytic activity in animal models, while sparing healthy cells. As set forth below, data with a tool analogue of CAN-3110 in a mouse model of glioma has shown survival benefit over control vectors when the agent is administered to mice at both early and late stages of tumor growth, even after tumor implantation has led to neuropathology.

   Shown Survival Benefit after rQNestin (CAN-3110 tool compound) treatment in mouse model of high-grade glioma


Our technology platform enables rapid HSV vector engineering and generation of new therapeutic candidates. Our platform allows rapid and precise modifications to the virus including the insertion of high cargo capacity DNA cargo cassettes, generation of both replication incompetent and competent agents, and other attributes which provide the opportunity to optimally design HSV technologies for specific therapeutic applications in oncolytic and immunotherapeutic indications. Our team has produced and released HSV vectors for multiple human clinical trials. Our HSV discovery platform allows us to feed and fill our pipeline, building on our vast experience in developing oncolytic viral immunotherapies.
Intratumoral administration
Both CAN-2409 and CAN-3110 are intentionally administered intratumorally. We believe that directly injecting these oncolytic viral immunotherapies into a patient’s cancerous tissue helps to optimize the benefit/risk for these agents to be highly immunostimulatory at the site of the tumor, whereas systemically administered agents would need to avoid detection by the body’s immune surveillance mechanisms to avoid rapid destruction before getting to the target tumor. Intratumoral administration is straightforward and feasible in the indications that we have selected. The first FDA approved oncolytic virus, Imlygic, is intratumorally administered. Although approved, this agent has had modest commercial success, with annual peak worldwide sales under $100M. These commercial results can be explained by a variety of factors. First, Imlygic treatment missed the endpoint of improved survival. Second, at the time of Imlygic’s approval, other successful treatments became available, such as immune check point inhibitors, and BRAF/MEK inhibitors. Third, Imlygic requires -70°C storage, which necessitates specialized and expensive equipment. CAN-2409, in contrast, is stable at 4°C, which is compatible with inexpensive storage refrigerators. In summary, CAN-2409 injection is aligned with clinical practice, can be stored at regular refrigerator temperatures, and cost of goods are expected to be low.
Our CAN-2409 Programs
Localized Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men in the United States, representing a high level of medical burden and unmet need. Approximately 200,000 men in the United States are diagnosed with prostate cancer annually, with more than 30,000 deaths each year. As shown in the chart below, of the approximately 150,000 men in the United States who were diagnosed in 2020 before their prostate cancer had metastasized, roughly 105,000 are considered intermediate- or high-risk of progression and approximately 45,000 are considered to be low-risk. For the intermediate- and high-risk patients, the standard of care is radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy often in conjunction with androgen deprivation therapy or chemical castration. Weighing the balance between therapeutic efficacy and side effects linked to therapy, about 10% of the intermediate-risk patients, and approximately 40% of the low-risk patients decide, in consultation with their physicians, to adopt a close monitoring approach known as active surveillance that involves periodic imaging, biomarker evaluation and biopsies.
   CAN-2409 current target patient populations in localized prostate cancer
   
To our knowledge, the only FDA-approved pharmacologic intervention indicated for newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer is chemical castration therapy, also known as ADT. Standard of care for localized disease is primarily surgery, radiotherapy and/or ADT. Because ADT has a potentially severe side effect profile, including impotence, hot flashes, mood changes, depression and others, these hormone treatments are reserved only for those patients that present the highest risk of localized or metastatic prostate cancer. Similarly, surgical prostatectomy can often cause urinary dysfunction and sexual dysfunction that can last years and sometimes be permanent. Approximately one-third of men with normal baseline function will report some increase in urinary symptoms and urgency after prostatectomy and the majority of men will experience some erectile dysfunction after treatment with either surgery or radiation.
As a result of PSA screening programs, a majority of patients are diagnosed at early stages of disease with low grade, low volume, asymptomatic prostate cancer. Current screening methods are inadequate to definitively identify which patients are most likely to progress. As a result of these side effects, there is a large desire to delay or prevent the need for radical treatment. As a result, many men with prostate cancer meeting the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for low-risk prostate cancer choose not to be treated and to undergo an intense monitoring program, known as Active Surveillance (AS), as their preferred initial course of treatment. However, within 10 years of diagnosis, between 21 and 38% of men will have developed progressive cancer and require invasive treatments. It has been reported that 21 and 41% of patients initially under AS convert to active treatment based on progression of their disease within two and five years, and approximately 17% of men undergoing AS choose to move to active treatments within 10 years of diagnosis, even in the absence of any evidence of progression, underscoring the level of concern around progression and the significant unmet need in this early line of treatment.
We believe CAN-2409 provides a significant commercial opportunity for therapeutic use in the newly diagnosed, localized prostate cancer patient population, with the goal of reducing progression or recurrence of disease without significant toxicities and with a product that can be administered at outpatient facilities.
Clinical Experience with CAN-2409 for Prostate Cancer
We have completed multiple Phase 1 clinical trials in non-metastatic prostate cancer using CAN-2409 as monotherapy and in combination with standard of care. The results of these trials provide evidence to support CAN-2409 immune activation, dosing levels and schedules as well as a favorable tolerability profile. We have administered CAN-2409 to over 700 patients with localized prostate cancer to date, of which approximately 500 are in currently ongoing, placebo-controlled randomized trials.
Monotherapy Activity
We have observed what we believe to be a clinical response with CAN-2409 as monotherapy in our Phase 1 trials. These responses have been observed in patients with prostate cancer, including patients with newly diagnosed, localized disease, as well as those whose cancer was progressing even after radiotherapy.
In newly diagnosed patients with localized prostate cancer, analysis of biopsies following monotherapy CAN-2409 treatment revealed change in glandular architecture, necrosis and increased immune cell infiltration as compared to baseline biopsy. We observed in treated samples a 4-fold increase in the number of CD8 positive T cells and a 3-fold increase in the number of CD68+ macrophages, demonstrating immune response to CAN-2409.
   Induction of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in Phase 1/2 prostate cancer trial
   
In another of our Phase 1 trials, patients whose prostate cancer had progressed following radiotherapy and that presented a persistently rising PSA level, were treated with CAN-2409 as monotherapy using six dose levels, ranging from 1x108–1x1011 viral particles. In 27 of the 36 patients recruited, a decrease in PSA levels was observed following a single cycle of CAN-2409, as measured by the best PSA decrease in serial assessments within the first 3 months after treatment. PSA, while an imperfect biomarker for prostate cancer, is still widely employed for patient management in conjunction with biopsy, as rising PSA levels, and in particular PSA doubling time are associated with disease progression. In that same trial, we observed that the PSA doubling time improved significantly (p=0.0271) from 15.9 months at baseline to 42.5 months after a single cycle of CAN-2409 administration, in this treatment resistant patient population. A subset of the patients in this trial also received second or third injection courses of CAN-2409. In the majority of those patients, a decrease from pre-administration PSA levels was again observed upon repeated injection. This dynamic is illustrated below in the inset PSA graph of “patient 19” in this trial. The orange datapoints represent PSA levels immediately prior to CAN-2409 administration. After a first dose, the patient’s PSA level dropped below baseline levels for over 10 months, at which point serial increases were observed, as expected in recurrent prostate cancer. Upon a second injection course of CAN-2409, a sequential drop in PSA was again induced, indicating potentially repeated CAN-2409 activity even in recurrent disease subsequent to an initial response.

   Use of CAN-2409 in combination therapy
Because of the increasing prevalence of combination therapy for cancer patients, the ability to combine novel agents with standard of care treatments without overlapping toxicity is of increasing importance. We believe that the favorable tolerability profile of CAN-2409 demonstrated in our clinical trials is encouraging for our current and future development plans, in combination with other agents but also as a monotherapy in lower risk patient populations that are not willing to undergo more aggressive forms of treatment. The safety data from our Phase 2 clinical trial in prostate cancer patients treated with CAN-2409 in combination with standard of care are summarized in the table below. Of note is the absence of reported grade 4 treatment related adverse events and only single-patient incidence of grade 3 treatment related adverse events. It was anticipated that flu-like symptoms would be evident, because CAN-2409 is an adenoviral gene construct known to induce a systemic immune response. Greater than 50% of patients reported fever and/or chills often associated with viral immune activation. These symptoms, which generally manifested early and transiently, often occurred on the evening of the intratumoral administration of CAN-2409 and resolved by the following morning. The rates of the gastrointestinal adverse events are consistent with those typically reported by patients undergoing radiotherapy, which is a component of standard of care in this population.
Phase 2 prostate cancer safety data for prostate cancer patients treated with CAN-2409 in combination with standard of care
   
   Our Phase 2 trial data informed our agreement with the FDA under the SPA for our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial. In our Phase 2 clinical trial, we observed that intermediate-risk patients who received CAN-2409 in combination with radiotherapy had failure rates that were 75% lower than those reported in four other contemporaneous trials of similar
   patient populations as shown in the table below, although this is limited because we have not conducted head-to-head studies. Where these other clinical trials reported freedom from failure rates of between 75-79%, corresponding to cumulative recurrence rates of 21-25%, CAN-2409 resulted in a 5% recurrence rate in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The median follow-up for the clinical trial of CAN-2409 was 5.7 years. Similarly, results in this clinical trial also demonstrated reduced recurrence rates in the low- and high-risk patients enrolled when compared to these other trials. Furthermore, a pathological complete response (pCR) was observed in 93% of the biopsies available at 2yrs (37%-73% in control populations). In this trial, low-risk patients achieved a PSA of < 2ng/ml in 77% of CAN-2409 treated patients versus 58% in control populations. The schema for this trial is shown below.
Completed phase 2 clinical trial of CAN-2409 combined with radiotherapy +/- androgen deprivation therapy
   
Freedom from failure in varying risk populations of localized prostate cancer
   
These were not head-to-head studies, which limits the ability to compare results.
The endpoint used in our Phase 2 trial is freedom from failure (FFF), defined by the period of time between treatment and the occurrence of a clinical or biochemical failure. Under the SPA agreement, we have selected disease-free survival (DFS) as the endpoint for our Phase 3 clinical trial. The DFS definition requires an objective detection of tumor progression. This largely overlaps with FFF as it is often triggered by detection of an increased PSA levels (i.e., biochemical failure). We have also reanalyzed our Phase 2 data using DFS parameters, supporting the implementation of DFS as endpoint in our Phase 3 trial.
   Our Potentially Registrational Phase 3 Clinical Trial for Localized Prostate Cancer
We are developing CAN-2409 as a potential therapeutic option that avoids the long-term severe side effects of hormone therapy or surgical interventions. Based on the data from our clinical trials to date, we believe that CAN-2409 has the potential, if approved, to be the first product candidate approved for patients with localized prostate cancer in over 30 years. We are currently conducting a potentially registrational Phase 3 trial for CAN-2409, with agreement, under an SPA with the FDA for a single pivotal trial in newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer in intermediate and high-risk patients in combination with the standard of care, radiotherapy.
The clinical trial is targeting evaluating of over 700 patients, who are randomized 2:1. Patients will receive three investigational treatment courses of CAN-2409, each consisting of four concurrent injections of transrectal ultrasound guided administration of CAN-2409 followed by a course of oral valacyclovir. As illustrated schematically below, the first injection course is given at least 15 days but not more than 8 weeks before starting radiation. The second injection course is given 0-3 days prior to radiotherapy. The third and final injection course is delivered 15-22 days after the second injections. A fixed dose of valacyclovir is given for 14 days after each injection course. Standard of care external beam radiotherapy will be administered to patients throughout the course of the trial with optional ADT as determined by the treating physician.
Dosing scheme for CAN-2409 Phase 3 prostate cancer trial
   
Trial inclusion criteria are based on patients with localized prostate cancer meeting the NCCN criteria of intermediate-risk or patients presenting only one NCCN high-risk feature. NCCN intermediate-risk is defined as having at least one of the following: prostate serum antigen (PSA) of 10-20 ng/ml, Gleason Score of 7, and is staged T2b-T2c via the TNM staging system. Patients may also exhibit one high-risk characteristic that may consist of a PSA of 20+ ng/ml, a Gleason Score of 8-10, or a cancer that is up to stage T3a, but not more than one of these high-risk factors.
The SPA agreement specifically defines agreement with the FDA on the statistical design and power of the phase 3 trial, as well as the specifics of the primary endpoint definition. The SPA states that the study is adequately designed to provide the necessary data that, depending on the outcome, could support a biologics license application submission. The SPA does note the general point for all SPAs, that BLA filability and approvability are review issues and that a BLA approval will depend on the quality of actual clinical trial data, the robustness of the effect on the stated primary endpoint, the impact on the secondary endpoints, a favorable assessment of the study conduct, and analysis of safety information and other supportive data. We have approximately 50 active clinical sites for this clinical trial, and have enrolled over 700 patients, with enrollment completed in September 2021.
The primary endpoint for the clinical trial is DFS. Final results are expected in 2024. This trial has been designed to have 90% power, a hazard ratio of 0.5 and an alpha of 0.05. We are assuming a 15% improvement in the active arm (CAN-2409) as compared to placebo in the rate of events measured according to the DFS definition provided above.
   A schema of this trial is set forth below.
Ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of CAN-2409 in newly diagnosed, intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer
   
Phase 2 Clinical Trial for Active Surveillance
Clinical results to date suggest that CAN-2409 as monotherapy may reduce the rates of biochemical failure for patients with localized prostate cancer. In the AS setting, we will assess whether CAN-2409 has the potential to delay or prevent tumor progression to a later stage that demands radical treatment.
The Phase 2 clinical trial is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating 187 patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing AS. The trial completed enrollment in June 2019. Patients in this clinical trial were randomized 2:1, active to placebo. Patients randomized to the active arm received two investigational treatment courses of CAN-2409. The primary endpoint will assess patients’ risk of progression employing validated endpoints. We expect top line data from this clinical trial to be available in 2023. A schema of this trial is set forth below.

High-Grade Glioma
Glioblastoma, the most common form of high-grade glioma, is a relatively rare cancer with first-line drug treated prevalent population in the United States of approximately 16,113 patients. In second- and third-line population, this number drops to 11,642 and 6,548, respectively. Fewer than 10% of patients survive more than five years past their
   initial diagnosis. The median survival is under 15 months with the current standard of care. Treatment in the upfront setting is surgical resection, if possible, coupled with temozolomide and/or radiotherapy. Over half of patients are candidates for maximal surgical resection and a portion succeed, achieving removal of all visible tumor mass. This outcome is known as gross total resection. Few pharmaceutical treatment options exist for patients with high-grade glioma, with the last significant FDA approval over a decade ago. Avastin was approved in 2009, specifically for patients with recurrent glioblastoma, and approval was granted despite the absence of a survival benefit in the registrational studies. Temozolomide was approved over 20 years ago, in 1999, with no new agent significantly supplanting its use since then, further underscoring the profound unmet medical need in this condition. In the registrational clinical trials, temozolomide use only demonstrated 2.5-month overall survival benefit, yet still saw global annual sales of over $1 billion at its peak in 2010, shortly before generic products entered the market. The prognosis for glioblastoma that has recurred is even more dire. Patients have scarce treatment options. Current standard of care mainly consists of repeating first line treatment approaches or participating in a clinical trial of investigational agents. Median survival in the recurrent setting is approximately six months.
CAN-2409 for High-Grade Glioma
In our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in newly diagnosed patients with high-grade gliomas, including the difficult-to-treat glioblastoma, CAN-2409 demonstrated a statistically significant increase in patient survival when combined with current standard of care over the current standard of care alone (surgery, radiation and temozolomide). The trial compared the overall survival of 48 enrolled patients treated at 4 clinical sites with CAN-2409 plus standard of care against a matched controlled set of 134 patients enrolled at MGB who received only standard of care. The results demonstrated that the median overall survival of patients receiving standard of care alone was 13.5 months while patients receiving CAN-2409 plus standard of care was 17.1 months (p=0.0417) (left panel in the figure below). Importantly, a pre-planned analysis on a subset of patients treated surgically with gross total resection (>95% of tumor removed) during surgery (18 patients compared to 44 in the control arm), demonstrated a median overall survival of 25.1 months in the CAN-2409 arm versus 16.3 months in the standard of care group, with approximately a 50% improvement (p=0.0120) (right panel in the figure below). In this patient population, after three years, one in three patients was alive in the CAN-2409 arm compared to 1 in 20 patients in the standard of care group. At the end of the study, three of the patients who received CAN-2409 were alive without progression after 43, 62.1 and 88.5 months.

In our Phase 1/2 trials in high-grade glioma, CAN-2409 was generally well tolerated, with the majority of treatment-related adverse events being grade 1 or 2, and few reports of grade 3 or 4 events.

We are planning a potentially registrational Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with untreated high-grade glioma. The current trial design for this Phase 3 is planned to enroll patients with glioblastoma (WHO Grade IV) intended to undergo gross total resection and standard of care chemoradiation. The primary efficacy endpoint will be overall survival, powered to 90% with a hazard ratio of 0.65 and a type I error assumption of 2.5. We anticipate the trial to commence in the middle of 2022.
   CAN-2409 Checkpoint Combination Therapy for High-Grade Glioma
Based on the clinical outcomes in glioma patients treated with CAN-2409 and the biomarker evidence for CAN-2409-mediated immune stimulation, we performed preclinical studies to examine whether CAN-2409 treatment of high-grade glioma would be enhanced if combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors to increase antitumor T cell responses. Use of either an anti-PD-1 antibody or CAN-2409 alone resulted in 30%-50% long-term survival in a murine glioma model. This percentage increased to 88% when CAN-2409 and anti-PD-1 were administered together. Analysis of infiltrating T cells indicated that CAN-2409 increases the activation of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, suggesting that the activity of this combination is due to a complementary biological mechanism of the two treatment modalities.
A Phase 1 clinical trial for patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma examining the combination of CAN-2409 and anti-PD-1 nivolumab (Opdivo, BMS) in collaboration with BMS and ABTC has now completed enrollment. This is the first clinical trial to evaluate the combination of CAN-2409 and nivolumab in high-grade glioma patients. Combining CAN-2409 with an ICI such as anti-PD-1 may enhance anti-tumor T cell activation and expansion, with the potential for better clinical outcome.

Oncolytic Viral Immunotherapy in High-Grade Glioma
Oncolytic viral immunotherapy is a description of a therapeutic modality that encompasses multiple different constructs and divergent pharmacologic strategies. Some other viral approaches in high-grade glioma have previously failed, notably the investigational oncolytic viral immunotherapy agent Toca 511 that was evaluated in a Phase 2/3 trial in glioblastoma conducted by the company Tocagen. In the case of Toca 511, we believe the similarities to CAN-2409 in glioblastoma are very limited. Toca 511 was a retroviral construct that used a different transgene, was paired with a different prodrug, and had a different development program. There are significant differences between the programs. Of note, serotype 5 adenoviral gene constructs like CAN-2409 have been demonstrated to be highly immunogenic, whereas retroviruses are less immunogenic and therefore less likely to induce a strong innate immune response. Critically, in the single arm Phase 1 trial of Toca 511 in glioblastoma, the data from the investigational agent was compared to a non-concurrently treated external control group that was poorly matched to the demographics of the investigational cohort. For example, 74% of patients in the Toca 511 cohort had a Karnofsky performance score greater than 90, whereas only 51% of patients in the comparator group had such good clinical baseline status. The result was a (false) positive comparison in the Phase 1 trial in favor of the Toca 511 treated group. Further complicating interpretation of the Phase 2/3 trial, patients received only a median of two courses of prodrug commencing 6 weeks after virus dosing. With such significant differences between programs and in the conduct of clinical trials, we believe that such failures of other oncolytic viral immunotherapies in high-grade glioma and other indications have limited bearing on the probability of success of our planned Phase 3 trial of CAN-2409 in glioblastoma.
   Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors specifically PD-1 directed agents have transformed the treatment paradigm of NSCLC and become a backbone therapy for this indication. To date, seven immune checkpoint inhibitor products have been approved in a number of cancer indications, and there are numerous other related drug candidates in preclinical and clinical development. Global sales for ICIs in 2019 were approximately $23 billion with NSCLC, accounting for between 50 and 55% of overall sales. The commercial opportunity in NSCLC is significant. Drug treated patient populations in the US for 2020 are estimated at 75,160; 47,920 and 21,990 in first-, second- and third-line treatment, respectively. ICI use in NSCLC has become standard of care with approximately 49% of first-line patients in the US being treated with an ICI alone or in combination with other agents. Nonetheless, the median overall survival is approximately 22 months.
   To assess the potential for CAN-2409 to trigger immune activation and produce a “hot” tumor phenotype, we designed and completed a clinical trial in patients with surgically resectable lung cancer. In this Phase 1 trial, dose escalation of intratumoral neoadjuvant CAN-2409 was followed by tumor resection three weeks later. The specific goal was to obtain biological data to better understand the impact of CAN-2409 on the tumor microenvironment, with a specific focus on intratumoral CD8+ T cell activation and function while assessing effects on the systemic immune response. The effects of CAN-2409 were evaluated by comparing post-injection specimens to an internal control consisting of each patient’s own pre-treatment needle biopsy and blood samples, and an external cohort of matched patients who underwent standard surgical resection without CAN-2409. The results showed evidence of significant intratumoral and systemic immune activation. Selected analyses are set forth in the chart below. Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, both before and after CAN-2409 administration, demonstrate a significant increase in expression of proliferation and activation markers including HLA-DR, CD38 and Ki67 three weeks after CAN-2409 initiation. Other relevant findings in this clinical trial included an increase in some markers of T cell activation such as PD-1 and CTLA-4, which are targets of immune checkpoint inhibitors that have been approved for use in NSCLC.
CAN-2409 stimulated local and systemic T cell response in patients with NSCLC
   
In our NSCLC Phase 1 clinical trial, two patients experienced grade 3 dehydration with renal insufficiency, two patients presented grade 3 urinary retention and six patients were observed to have a grade 4 low lymphocyte count. Of significant interest, one patient, a 70 year old male with a 14.8cm stage IIIA sarcomatoid carcinoma, exhibited a nearly 50% decrease in tumor volume at 3 weeks after CAN-2409 monotherapy treatment. Scans from this patient are shown below. Collectively, these results lead us to believe that CAN-2409 could provide an opportunity to improve ICI response rates in patients with NSCLC by eliciting additional immune activation in lung cancer patients.

CAN-2409 and Checkpoint Combination Phase 2 Clinical Trial for NSCLC in Patients with Inadequate Response to ICI
We have initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in NSCLC patients with inadequate response to ICI that will enroll patients receiving standard of care immune checkpoint inhibitors (plus chemotherapy if indicated) across three cohorts in combination with two courses of CAN-2409 plus ICI. We believe there is an opportunity to utilize CAN-2409 immune activation to improve ICI response rates with a short-term readout.
Our open label Phase 2 trial will enroll 96 patients and we expect initial safety data, translational biomarkers and efficacy data to be presented in the second quarter of 2022. The trial schema is set forth below.

   Additional Solid Tumor Opportunity
 Pancreatic Cancer
We are currently conducting an exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial for CAN-2409 in pancreatic cancer, with enrollment ongoing. We anticipate presenting interim data in 2023. In a previous Phase 1b trial, patients with pancreatic cancer treated with CAN-2409 in addition to standard of care demonstrated a greater survival duration over the expected survival of the patients treated with the existing standard of care alone in a comparison to historical trial results. Furthermore, in a number of patients where pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies were available, a statistically significant increase in the number of CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes was observed. In addition, the study concluded that CAN-2409 was generally well-tolerated in combination with standard of care.

Other Cancer Indications
In addition to patients with prostate, brain, lung and pancreatic cancer, CAN-2409 has been dosed in small early-stage exploratory clinical trials in patients with ovarian cancer, malignant pleural effusion, pediatric brain cancer and retinoblastoma, supporting the tolerability profile described above.
Our CAN-3110 Program: Recurrent Glioma
Our first HSV-based product candidate, CAN-3110, is now in an investigator-initiated Phase 1 clinical trial in recurrent glioblastoma. This clinical trial is assessing CAN-3110 and is an open-label, single center, dose-escalation clinical trial. The primary endpoint of this clinical trial is to analyze the safety of CAN-3110 use, in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in doses ranging from 1x106 to 1x1010 PFU in half-log increments. 30 patients have been treated in the initial dose escalation phase and 12 additional patients had been dosed in a dose expansion phase as of April 30, 2021.
Immunohistologic studies showed persistent presence of HSV antigen and infiltration by CD8+ cytotoxic tumor infiltrating lymphocytes post treatment, providing support for the expected mechanism of action of CAN-3110.
   Oncolytic HSV infection and CD8+ T cell infiltration after CAN-3110 treatment in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma
   
We are particularly encouraged by the clinical course of a patient who received CAN-3110 as a monotherapy upon recurrence of glioblastoma. The patient was diagnosed with multicentric glioblastoma and initially treated with standard of care surgical resection followed by temozolomide and radiotherapy. The patient later recurred with two lesions visualized on MRI. One, in the frontal region, was at the site of the initially resected mass and is labelled “Secondary lesion” in the MRI images below. The second, larger mass was a new lesion and is labeled as “Injected lesion” in the MRI images below. The patient received CAN-3110 via stereotactic administration into the injected lesion. At day 56 post-injection, there was a visible decrease in the volume of both masses. By day 112 post-injection, the volume of both masses was further reduced and the patient was able to go back to work. The patient eventually developed a third tumor and, following a stroke secondary to a diagnostic procedure, refused further treatment, dying approximately 15 months after participation in the trial. We find this to be an encouraging case report because of the unusually favorable disease course experienced by this patient in absence of concurrent therapies. Additionally, we have observed a median overall survival of 11.7 months in our Phase 1 trial in the first 30 patients as of the cutoff date of April 21, 2021. Given the median overall survival of 6-9 months in historical clinical trials of other investigational agents in patients with recurrent high grade glioma, we believe this is encouraging evidence of clinical activity. We received additional data from this open-label trial in November 2021 and will continue to assess CAN-3110 in this clinical trial.

This trial is complementary to our work in the first line treatment setting of high-grade glioma with CAN-2409, a non-replicating viral construct. We believe that with the larger tumor burden frequently observed in the recurrent setting and more infrequent use of surgery in this population, a replication competent viral construct such as CAN-3110 may be a more appropriate approach.
Collaborations and Other Transactions
We are a party to a number of license and collaboration agreements under which we license patents, patent applications and other intellectual property to and from third parties. These licenses impose various diligence and financial payment obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license agreements in the future. We consider the following license and collaboration agreements to be material to our business:
Periphagen. On December 9, 2019, we entered into a series of agreements, including an exclusive license agreement, a novation agreement, an equipment purchase agreement and an intellectual property assignment agreement, collectively the Periphagen Agreements, with Periphagen, whereby we acquired certain assets and licensed certain rights (including specified patent rights and know-how, or the Licensed IP Rights) of Periphagen, primarily consisting of exclusive rights to their technology platform and a portfolio of pre-clinical, development stage virus vectors, as well as certain physical property and equipment. The primary classes of assets are HSV-derived assets expressing neurotrophin-3 (or NT-3 Assets) and other HSV-derived assets (Gene Transfer Neuro-Assets). Under the license agreement, Periphagen granted us a worldwide exclusive license with the right to grant sublicenses through multiple tiers under the Licensed IP Rights to conduct research and to develop, make, have made, use, have used, offer for sale, have sold, export and import products incorporating the Licensed IP Rights in all fields of use except the treatment, diagnosis, and prevention of nononcologic skin diseases and conditions (including use as an aesthetic).
   In addition, pursuant to the Periphagen Agreements, we undertook certain commitments and obligations, including the assumption of Periphagen’s outstanding loan in the principal amount of $1,000,000 with Diamyd Medical, AB. The promissory note has a contractual interest rate of 2% compounded annually, with the outstanding balance and accrued interest due upon maturity in November 2027, with no interim installments.
In consideration for the licenses under the Periphagen Agreements, we paid Periphagen $811,000 upon signing and agreed to make the following royalty and other payments:
▪NT-3 Assets: a single digit percentage of net sales of NT-3 Assets, or, if applicable, a percentage of royalties received by us in the event of a license, sublicense, assignment or other transfer to a third party for commercialization (but no greater than the original royalty percentage we would be required to pay in the event we did not license, sublicense, assign or transfer NT-3 Assets); 
 ▪Gene Transfer Neuro-Assets: a single digit percentage of net sales of Gene Transfer Neuro-Assets, or, if applicable, a percentage of royalties received by us in the event of a license, sublicense, assignment or other transfer to a third party for commercialization to treat certain conditions and diseases (but no greater than the original royalty percentage we would be required to pay in the event we did not license, sublicense, assign or transfer Gene Transfer Neuro-Assets); 
 ▪Combination Products: a certain percentage (based on the weighted average sale price of NT-3 Assets, or Gene Transfer Neuro-Assets, as applicable) of net sales of combination products; and 
 ▪Disposition Income: (i) a single digit royalty rate of certain consideration we receive for the grant of a license, assignment or other intellectual property rights related to the NT-3 Assets and (ii) if we consummate a strategic collaboration with certain specified parties to treat non-oncolygic neurological conditions and diseases, either 2nd decile (if consummated within 18 months) or mid-2nd decile to mid-3rd decile (if consummated thereafter) royalty rates of certain consideration we receive for the grant of a license, assignment or other intellectual property rights related to the Gene Transfer Neuro-Assets. 
 If we are required to pay royalties to a third party on any product covered under the Periphagen Agreements, we may credit such royalty payments against the royalties owed to Periphagen in the applicable country, up to a percentage reduction in the mid-2nd decile.
The exclusive license agreement with Periphagen, or the Periphagen License Agreement, requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete a human proof of concept clinical trial of an NT-3 Asset, which includes certain specified clinical milestones. If we fail to use such efforts, subject to dispute and escalation provisions in the Periphagen License Agreement, then we may submit a specified payment in lieu of satisfying such obligations. If we fail to do so, Periphagen may terminate the Periphagen License Agreement for material breach.
The Periphagen License Agreement expires on the later of December 9, 2069 or the end of the Royalty Term. Upon expiration, we will have a fully paid-up, non-exclusive license to make, use, sell, offer for sale and import any products that incorporate the Licensed IP Rights. The Royalty Term means, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, the period starting on the first commercial sale of such product in such country and concluding on the later of (i) expiration of patent coverage under the Licensed IP Rights or regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country; or (ii) the date that a certain amount of generic competition exists in such country, provided that no Royalty Term shall exceed 30 years.
The Periphagen License Agreement may be terminated (i) by us for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice to Periphagen, (ii) by Periphagen if we remain in breach of the Periphagen Agreement following a cure period to remedy the breach or (iii) by Periphagen if we become bankrupt, file for bankruptcy or otherwise become insolvent or are placed in receivership.
MGB. On January 20, 2018, we entered into an exclusive option agreement, or the Option Agreement, with MGB. Pursuant to the Option Agreement, we obtained the exclusive right from MGB to negotiate an exclusive worldwide, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize products covered by certain MGB patents, including those patents covering CAN-3110, in the field of gene therapy and oncolytic vector therapy for the treatment or prevention of cancerous tumors in humans or animals, as such field is further detailed in the Option Agreement, or the Licensed Field. In consideration for MGB’s granting of the exclusive option, we paid MGB a non-refundable fee of $40,000.
Under the Option Agreement, we were required to use reasonable efforts to enter into a clinical trial agreement with MGB. We entered into such clinical trial agreement with MGB, or the MGB Clinical Trial Agreement, on June 19, 2018. Under the MGB Clinical Trial Agreement, we have committed to remitting up to $750,000 for the performance of a specified Phase 1 clinical trial by MGB pursuant to a protocol summary contained in the Option Agreement.
   On September 15, 2020, we exercised our option and entered into an exclusive patent license agreement with MGB, or the MGB License Agreement. Under the MGB License Agreement, MGB granted to us (a) an exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain of MGB’s patents to make, have made, use, have used, sell and have sold certain products covered by such licensed patents, or the Licensed Products and otherwise practice processes covered by such licensed patents, or Licensed Processes; and (b) a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain other of MGB’s patents to make, have made, use, have used, sell and have sold Licensed Products, but not to sell or have sold Licensed Processes. The foregoing rights are sublicensable, subject to sublicensing terms set forth in the MGB License Agreement. In connection with executing the MGB License Agreement, we paid a license issue fee of $100,000. We also agreed to reimburse MGB for all reasonable fees and expenses MGB had incurred and will incur for the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights, in an amount equal to $141,268.
Under the MGB License Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and make available to the public Licensed Products in the Licensed Field, which efforts include certain milestones detailed in the MGB License Agreement.
Under the MGB License Agreement, prior to the first commercial sale of the Licensed Products, we are required to pay MGB an annual license fee beginning on the fourth anniversary of the effective date. Following the first commercial sale of the Licensed Products, we are required to pay MGB an annual minimum royalty, which amount may be credited against earned royalties starting in the fourth year following the first commercial sale.
In addition to such annual license fee and royalty obligations, the MGB License Agreement contains cumulative milestone payments for up to a maximum amount of $39,000,000, upon the achievement of various clinical, commercial and sales milestones of clinical and commercial development and sales, certain of which milestones apply to development and sale of any Licensed Product as a monotherapy and certain of which milestones apply to development and sale of any Licensed Product in combination with another therapy modality for the treatment of solid tumors.
We are required to pay royalties to MGB upon first commercial sale of the Licensed Products, which are paid at an increasing rate as net sales increase, ranging from low single digits to high single digits. We also agreed to pay a single digit royalty rate on net sales of any products developed using certain MGB know-how but which is not covered by the licensed patent rights, or derived products.
We may reduce our royalty obligations to MGB on any product (but not derived products) by an agreed-upon percentage if we are required to pay a royalty to a third party to avoid patent infringement claims in respect of our development and commercialization of Licensed Products. The royalty rate paid to MGB may not fall below a pre-specified percentage for the sale of any product and another percentage for the sale of any derived product.
Our obligation to pay royalties to MGB expires on a country-by-country basis on the latest of (i) the date upon which there ceases to be a valid claim of patent rights as further detailed in the MGB License Agreement in such country, (ii) expiration of statutory or regulatory exclusivity in such country and (iii) 10 years after the first commercial sale.
The MGB License Agreement also requires us to pay a percentage of any non-royalty income attributable to the sublicense, including (i) 2nd decile rates if such sublicense occurs prior to dosing the first patient in a Phase 2 trial, (ii) 1st decile rates if such sublicense occurs after dosing the first patient in a Phase 2 trial but before approval of a BLA by the FDA (or the equivalent approval and regulatory body in another major market country) and (iii) single digit rates if such sublicense occurs after approval of a BLA by the FDA (or the equivalent approval and regulatory body in another major market country).
The MGB License Agreement expires on the latest of (i) the 10th anniversary of the first commercial sale in the last country which has a commercial sale, (ii) the date on which all relevant issued patents and filed patent applications have expired or been abandoned and (iii) upon the expiration of market exclusivity on the applicable product.
The MGB License Agreement may be terminated by MGB (i) if we fail to pay any amounts owed under the terms of the agreement within a specified cure period, (ii) if we fail to maintain insurance in accordance with the MGB License Agreement, (iii) if we file for bankruptcy, or (iv) if we remain in default of the MGB License Agreement for non-financial reasons following a specified cure period to remedy the breach. The MGB License Agreement may be terminated by us for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice.
Ventagen. On March 1, 2014, we entered into an exclusive license agreement, or the Ventagen Agreement, with Ventagen, LLC, or Ventagen. The Ventagen Agreement provides Ventagen an exclusive license, with rights to
   grant sublicenses (subject to certain terms and conditions) under any worldwide patent rights and know-how owned or controlled by us during the term of the Ventagen Agreement which cover applicable technology utilizing the delivery method of the herpes derived TK protein to tumors or other tissues via a viral vector (as further specified therein), to research, use, have used, import, have imported, export, have exported, offer for sale, have sold, sell, distribute and market certain products for the prevention or treatment of cancer in humans and any use in animals (or the Field of Use), or the Licensed Products, for commercial sale and distribution within Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, Colombia and Bolivia (or the Territory).
Under the Ventagen Agreement, Ventagen agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize Licensed Products in the Territory in the Field of Use.
Ventagen agreed to pay us $1,000,000 for research and development, which we received in 2014 and 2015, and agreed to pay us a fixed future milestone payment of $2,500,000 upon Ventagen’s achievement of a specified amount of sales of a Licensed Product, which is subject to certain reductions for our direct cost over a specified threshold.
Ventagen also agreed to purchase all of its clinical and commercial supply of Licensed Products from us required for clinical or commercial purposes at a price of cost plus a specified increase of the wholesale price of the Licensed Products, subject to a minimum and maximum price, through the end of the Royalty Term, which is defined as the period commencing on the effective date of the Ventagen Agreement and ending on a country-by-country basis on the later of (i) the last expiration date of the patent rights covering a Licensed Product, (ii) twelve years from the receipt of marketing authorization of the Licensed Product in the applicable country, or (iii) the date a generic version of a Licensed Product that is manufactured, owned or controlled by a third party is granted a market authorization. If we are unable or unwilling to manufacture supply under the terms of the Ventagen Agreement, Ventagen has the right to manufacture its own supply and will be required to pay to us a fixed fee per dose sold by Ventagen, its affiliates, agents, sublicensee or end users. We have also agreed to provide certain services to Ventagen related to Ventagen’s development plan.
The Ventagen Agreement expires on the date of the expiration of the final Royalty Term in all countries in the Territory. The Ventagen Agreement may be terminated (i) by Ventagen at will upon 30 days’ prior written notice to us, (ii) by us subject to a specified notice period if Ventagen files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent or (iii) by us if Ventagen remains in material breach of the Ventagen Agreement following notice and a cure period to remedy the breach. Ventagen retains an irrevocable, perpetual, paid up, royalty-free license, with rights of sublicense to use, have used, lease, import and export, offer to sell, sell, have sold, product, distribute and market Licensed Products in each country in the Territory after the expiration of the Royalty Term in such country.
Certain of our current shareholders own 49.5% of the voting stock of Ventagen, but we do not hold any management position or run the day-to-day operations of Ventagen. See “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions.”
 Competition
The development and commercialization of new product candidates is highly competitive. We face competition from major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies among others with respect to CAN-2409 and CAN-3110 and will face similar competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. We compete in pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that develop immune-oncology therapies for the treatment of cancer. There are other companies working to develop viral immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer including divisions of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies of various sizes. The large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that have commercialized and/or are developing immuno-oncology treatments for cancer include AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, Merck & Co., Novartis, Pfizer and Genentech.
Some of the products and therapies developed by our competitors are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, including with respect to the use of viral immunotherapy with adenovirus and HSV. Other competitive products and therapies are based on entirely different approaches. We are aware that Oncorus, Inc., Replimune Group, Inc., Amgen Inc., Astellas Pharma, Inc, Istari Oncology Inc, Orca Therapeutics, B.V., CG Oncology, Inc, ImmVira Co., Ltd., IconOVir Bio, Inc., and FerGene, Inc., among others, are developing viral immunotherapies that may have utility for the treatment of indications that we are targeting. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.
Many of the companies we compete against or may compete against in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials,
   obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in concentration of even more resources among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, in establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials and in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, or are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience and price, if required, the level of biosimilar or generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Commercialization
We intend to retain significant development and commercial rights to our product candidates and, if marketing approval is obtained, to commercialize our product candidates on our own, or potentially with a partner, in the United States and other regions. We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company commercializing products. We intend to build the necessary infrastructure and capabilities over time for the United States, and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our product candidates. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population, the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence or alter our commercialization plans.
Manufacturing
We have established an operations leadership team with extensive experience in manufacturing biologics based on viruses, including oncolytic products and gene therapy products, and in the construction, validation, approval and operation of facilities designed to manufacture biologics. We have received proposals from and are evaluating third-party contract manufacturing organizations for commercial-scale manufacturing of our CAN-2409 product candidates. We are also currently evaluating various options for the clinical scale manufacture of our CAN-3110 product candidate, including the development of clinical-scale manufacturing capabilities in our facility in Needham, Massachusetts.
Intellectual Property
We have obtained Orphan drug designation for CAN-2409 for the treatment of glioblastoma, which makes the product candidate eligible for a period of orphan drug exclusivity, if approved in this indication, under certain conditions.
We believe that approval of our CAN-2409 and CAN-3110 product candidates under a BLA may result in 12 years of data exclusivity in the United States under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, 10 years of market exclusivity in Europe and significant durations in other markets, which would be complementary to any relevant patent exclusivity.
Through licensing and developing our own portfolio, we have rights to one issued composition of matter patent in the United States that relates to CAN-3110, which expires in 2036 and is exclusively licensed to us. We also own a patent issued in the United States that relates to a method of use of CAN-2409 in combination with other agents that expires in 2034. There are also multiple patent applications in the United States and foreign countries, that are fully or partially owned by us or are exclusively licensed to us by the inventor owners.
  Government Regulation
In the United States, biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and licensure under the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. The FD&C Act and corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, clinical trial, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, marketing, promotion, export and import, advertising, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting involving biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.
Further, even if we obtain the required regulatory approvals for our products, pharmaceutical companies are subject to myriad federal, state, and foreign healthcare laws, rules, and regulations governing all aspects of our operations, including, but not limited to, our relationships with healthcare professionals, healthcare institutions, distributors of our products, and sales and marketing personnel; governmental and other third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of our products; and data privacy and security. Such laws, rules, and regulations are complex, continuously evolving, and,
   in many cases, have not been subject to extensive interpretation by applicable regulatory agencies or the courts. We are required to invest significant time and financial resources in policies, procedures, processes, and systems to ensure compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations, and our failure to do so may result in the imposition of substantial monetary or other penalties by federal or state regulatory agencies, give rise to reputational harm, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
United States biological products development process
The process required by the FDA before a biological product candidate may be licensed for marketing in the United States generally involves the following:
▪completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with FDA’s good laboratory practices, or GLPs, requirements and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;

 Pre-clinical Studies and the IND Process
Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of the product’s biological characteristics, chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
Prior to commencing an initial clinical trial in humans with a product candidate in the United States, an IND must be submitted to the FDA and the FDA must allow the IND to proceed. An IND is an exemption from the FD&C Act that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA allowance that such investigational product may be administered to humans in connection with such trial. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration. In support of a request for an IND, the clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Once submitted, the IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the IND on a full or partial clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial or part of the study can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a sponsor’s IND at any time before or during clinical trials due to, among other considerations, unreasonable or significant safety concerns, inability to assess safety concerns, lack of qualified investigators, a misleading or materially incomplete investigator brochure, study design deficiencies, interference with the conduct or completion of a study designed to be adequate and well-controlled for the same or another investigational product, insufficient quantities of investigational product, lack of effectiveness, or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.
   Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters and criteria to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. An IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the trial at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to trial subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the trial and may recommend halting the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
Certain information about certain clinical trials must also be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
▪Phase 1. The biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the biological product candidate in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. 
 ▪Phase 2. The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population with a specific disease or condition to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 ▪Phase 3. The biological product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for approval and product labeling. 
 In March 2022, the FDA released a final guidance entitled “Expansion Cohorts: Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics,” which outlines how developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology biological product development (i.e., the first-in-human clinical trial) to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts are included in IND applications and assessed by FDA. Expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to biological product development and reduce developmental costs and time.
In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may also be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among
   other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Both the FDA and the EMA provide expedited pathways for the development of biological product candidates for treatment of rare diseases, particularly life threatening diseases with high unmet medical need. Such biological product candidates may be eligible to proceed to registration following a single clinical trial in a limited patient population, sometimes referred to as a Phase 1/2 trial, but which may be deemed a pivotal or registrational trial following review of the trial’s design and primary endpoints by the applicable regulatory agencies. Determination of the requirements to be deemed a pivotal or registrational trial is subject to the applicable regulatory authority’s scientific judgement and these requirements may differ in the United States and the European Union.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some trials also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
U.S. review and approval processes
Assuming successful the completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human clinical trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee, although the fee may be waived under certain circumstances. Under the performance goals and policies implemented by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA targets ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the BLA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to ensure its continued safety, purity and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult or novel questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a
   Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA for a novel product (e.g., new active ingredient, new indication, etc.) must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, including to subpopulations of patients, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, precautions or interactions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing trials. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
Orphan product designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or 200,000 or more individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
Orphan product designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. If a product that has orphan product designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan product exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan
   product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if a product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if the second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits.
Expedited development and review programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. To be eligible for fast track designation, new drugs and biological product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a fast track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. One benefit of fast track designation, for example, is that the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with the FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review.
Under the FDA’s breakthrough therapy program, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough therapy designation comes with all of the benefits of fast track designation. The FDA may take other actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including holding meetings with the sponsor and providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development program.
A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal is to review an application in six months once it is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
Additionally, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify the clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, that all advertising and promotional materials, intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product.
Post-approval requirements
Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements, as well as requirements relating to record keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. Manufacturers of products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological
   products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
Manufacturers must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, product detentions or refusal to permit the import or export of the product, restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors or other stakeholders, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements on sponsors and their contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug and biological products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States.. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of a biological product, some of a sponsor’s U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In addition, a patent can only be extended once and only for a single product. The United States Patent and trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our patents, if and as applicable, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods, including some regulatory exclusivity periods tied to patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
The ACA includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing.
   Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.
FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and FDA will not approve an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until 12 years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate implementation and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
United States regulation of companion diagnostics
Our product candidates may require use of an in vitro diagnostic to identify appropriate patient populations. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, companion diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval.
If use of companion diagnostic is essential to safe and effective use of a drug or biological product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic contemporaneously with the approval of the therapeutic product. On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance, for novel candidates such as our product candidates, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding drug or biological candidate should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product labeling. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a biologic product candidate generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance document intended to further assist sponsors of therapeutic products and sponsors of in vitro companion diagnostic devices on issues related to co-development of these products.
The FDA generally requires companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain approval of a PMA for that diagnostic contemporaneously with approval of the therapeutic. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of therapeutic candidates such as those we are developing involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and pre-clinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are also subject to an application fee.
   PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive pre-clinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. In addition, as part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or a not-approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will issue an order denying approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable order. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval.
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
Additional regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines.
Government regulation outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, research and development, clinical trials, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products as well as authorization and approval of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Clinical trials regulation
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted for each clinical trial to each country’s national competent authority, or NCA, and at least one independent ethics committee, or EC, much like the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a
   country’s requirements, the corresponding clinical trial may proceed. Under the current regime (the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and corresponding national laws), all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the EU Member State where they occurred.
In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new Regulation, which will be directly applicable in all Member States (meaning that no national implementing legislation in each EU Member State is required), aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For instance, the new Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications. It is expected that the new Regulation will come into effect following confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System, the centralized EU portal and database for clinical trials foreseen by the new Regulation, through an independent audit, which is currently expected to occur in December 2021.
European Union drug review and approval
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization. To obtain regulatory approval of a medicinal product in the EEA, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA. A centralized marketing authorization is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, and is valid throughout the EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products such as (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines), and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EEA.
Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, it provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
The application used to submit the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, although there may be certain specific requirements, for example those set out in Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 on Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products, covering gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue-engineered medicinal products.
Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the European Union, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized marketing authorizations (under the Northern Irish Protocol, centralized marketing authorizations will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized marketing authorization were automatically converted to Great Britain marketing authorizations on January, 1 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. A separate application will, however, still be required.
Data and market exclusivity
In the EEA, upon receiving marketing authorization, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EEA, during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EEA. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing
   therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if a product is considered to be an innovative medicinal product so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained a marketing authorization based on a MAA with a completely independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
 Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
Products receiving orphan designation in the EEA can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no “similar medicinal product” may be placed on the market. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union where an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan for pediatric studies has been complied with. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EEA are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if it meets the following criteria: (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five (5) in ten thousand (10,000) persons in the EEA when the application is made, or (b) it is unlikely that the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EEA, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the MAA if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product for the same indication at any time if:
▪the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; 
 ▪the marketing authorization holder of the authorized product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or 
 ▪the marketing authorization holder of the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. 
 Pediatric development
In the EEA, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, with the EMA’s pediatric committee, or PDCO, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a waiver applies (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The marketing authorization application for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted by the PDCO of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. Products that are granted a marketing authorization with the results of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) even where the trial results are negative. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
Post-approval controls
Following approval, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal product. These include the following:
▪The holder of a marketing authorization must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, who is responsible for oversight of that system. 

   Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
▪All new MAAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions. 
 ▪All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, or SmPC, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under European Union directives, the details are governed by regulations in each European Union Member State and can differ from one country to another. 
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
In June 2016, the electorate in the UK voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Thereafter, in March 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The UK formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020. A transition period began on February 1, 2020, during which European Union pharmaceutical law remained applicable to the UK, however this ended on December 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the UK and European Union entered into a Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The agreement sets out certain procedures for approval and recognition of medical products in each jurisdiction. Since the regulatory framework in the UK covering the quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU Directives and Regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the UK, as the UK legislation now has the potential to diverge from EU legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the UK in the long-term. The MHRA has recently published detailed guidance for industry and organizations to follow from January 1, 2021 now the transition period is over, which will be updated as the UK’s regulatory position on medicinal products evolves over time.
Health Reform
 In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, subjects biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and creates a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition to coverage under Medicare Part D for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact our business.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted:
 •On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will 

   remain in effect through 2030 unless additional action is taken by Congress. Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, as well as subsequent legislation, these reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, a 1% payment reduction will occur beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and the 2% payment reduction will resume on July 1, 2022.
•On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.
 •On April 13, 2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
 •On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
 •On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020.
 •On December 20, 2019, former President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future.
 Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services and result in reduced demand for certain pharmaceutical products or additional pricing pressures.
 Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. presidential executive orders, congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
 At the federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates would have been be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. However, on December 29, 2021 CMS rescinded the Most Favored Nations rule. Additionally, on November 30, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to
   become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
 At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our drugs or put pressure on our drug pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our drugs or put pressure on our drug pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS, an agency within HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon several factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a product is:
 •a covered benefit under its health plan;
 •safe, effective and medically necessary;
 •appropriate for the specific patient;
 •cost-effective; and
 •neither experimental nor investigational.
 Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, which will require additional expenditure above and beyond the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, our operations and financial condition. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of
   any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.
▪The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or certain rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. 
 ▪The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, or FCA, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. 
 ▪The federal civil monetary penalties laws impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer or remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary, if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies. 
 ▪The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity may be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. 
 ▪HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their respective business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates in some cases, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 

   ▪The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the ACA, imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made in the previous year to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. 
 ▪Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers. 
 ▪Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may be broader in scope than the provisions described above and may apply regardless of payor. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and relevant federal government compliance guidance; require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers; restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures and pricing information. State and foreign laws may govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. These data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, which may complicate compliance efforts. 
 The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from its business.
 Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of March 15, 2022, we had 65 employees. Of these employees, 49 perform research and development functions. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we believe we maintain good relations with our employees.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
Legal proceedings
From time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to any litigation or legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are probable to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
