Item 1.BUSINESS
Overview
We are a deep-sea minerals exploration company focused on the collection, processing and refining of polymetallic nodules found on the seafloor in international waters of the Clarion Clipperton Zone (“CCZ”), about 1,300 nautical miles south-west of San Diego, California. The CCZ is a geological submarine fracture zone of abyssal plains and other formations in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, with a length of around 7,240 km (4,500 miles) that spans approximately 4,500,000 square kilometers (1,700,000 sq mi). Polymetallic nodules are discrete rocks that sit unattached to the seafloor, occur in significant quantities in the CCZ and have high concentrations of nickel, manganese, cobalt and copper in a single rock.
These four metals contained in the polymetallic nodules are critical for the transition to clean energy. Our resource definition work to date shows that nodules in our contract areas represent the world’s largest estimated undeveloped source of critical battery metals. If we are able to collect polymetallic nodules from the seafloor on a commercial scale, we plan to use such nodules to produce three types of metal products: (i) feedstock for battery cathode precursors (nickel and cobalt sulfates) for electric vehicles (“EV”) and renewable energy storage markets, (ii) copper cathode for EV wiring, clean energy transmission and other applications, and (iii) manganese silicate for manganese alloy production required for steel production. Our mission is to build a carefully managed, shared stock of metal (a “metals common”) that can be used, recovered and reused for generations to come. Significant quantities of newly mined metal are required because existing metal stocks are insufficient to meet rapidly rising demand.
Exploration and exploitation of seabed minerals in international waters is regulated by the International Seabed Authority (“ISA”), an intergovernmental organization established pursuant to the 1994 Agreement Relating to the Implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (“UNCLOS”). The ISA grants contracts to sovereign states or to private contractors who are sponsored by a sovereign state. The ISA requires that a contractor must obtain and maintain sponsorship by a host nation that is a member of the ISA and signatory to UNCLOS and such nation must maintain effective supervision and regulatory control over such sponsored contractor. The ISA has issued a total of 19 polymetallic nodule exploration contracts covering approximately 1.28 million km2, or 0.4% of the global seafloor, 17 of which are in the CCZ. We hold exclusive exploration and commercial rights to three of the 17 polymetallic nodule contract areas in the CCZ through our subsidiaries Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. (“NORI”) and Tonga Offshore Mining Limited (“TOML”), sponsored by the Republic of Nauru (“Nauru”) and the Kingdom of Tonga (“Tonga”), respectively, and exclusive commercial rights through our subsidiary, DeepGreen Engineering Pte. Ltd.’s (“DGE”), arrangement with Marawa Research and Exploration Limited (“Marawa”), a company owned and sponsored by the Republic of Kiribati (“Kiribati”).
We are still in the exploration phase and have not yet obtained any exploitation contracts from the ISA to commence commercial scale polymetallic nodule collection in the CCZ nor have we obtained the applicable environmental permits and other permits required to build and operate commercial scale polymetallic nodule processing and refining plants on land.

Polymetallic Nodules
Deep-sea polymetallic nodules form on or just below the sediment-covered seafloor of the abyssal plains. These nodules contain significant amounts of metals, and their unique characteristic compared to terrestrial deposits is the presence of four critical metals in one deposit.

​
Additionally, polymetallic nodules in the CCZ possess the following characteristics:
​

Characteristic | ​ | What it means 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Far removed from human communities | ​ | No need for social displacement 
No vegetation or other obstructions covering access to nodules | ​ | No need to remove overburden, no rock cutting or blasting 
Unattached to the seafloor, 90% of nodule mass in the top 5 cm | ​ | No need for destructive rock cutting and excavation 
High grades of four critical metals in a single ore | ​ | Four times less mass to process compared to land ores 
Low head-grade variability | ​ | Potentially easy to process 
2-10 cm diameter | ​ | Potentially easy to handle 
Microporous | ​ | Potentially easy to smelt 
Very low concentrations of hazardous elements like arsenic, antimony and mercury | ​ | Potential to productize 100% of nodule mass and design a metallurgical flowsheet that generates no tailings and leaves nearly no solid waste streams behind

​

The above characteristics of polymetallic nodules may provide an opportunity to compress lifecycle environmental and social impacts of producing critical metals as compared to land ores. In order to extract nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese from land ores, at least three different types of ores would need to be excavated. Mine development often involves social displacement and impacts on indigenous people as well as deforestation, destruction of carbon sinks and biodiversity loss. In addition, several times more mass would need to be processed, often requiring significant amounts of local water resources; mining and processing tailings which can be toxic and need to be managed indefinitely in tailings dams, using dry-stacking or a practice known as deep-sea tailings placement (DSTP). Furthermore, metal production from land ores can release several toxic streams into the surrounding environment which can negatively impact the health of local communities and ecosystems. We believe using nodules to produce critical metals can help reduce several of these impacts associated with mining land ores. If our nodules are to be processed and refined in the U.S., we can also compress the current supply chain of 50,000 miles that some materials need to travel before reaching U.S. down to 1,500 miles, while reducing dependency on China which dominates refining for battery metals like nickel and cobalt.
Market Opportunity
A 2021 study by the International Energy Agency shows that the production of clean energy transition minerals could increase by 600% by 2040 to meet the growing demand for clean energy technologies required to keep global warming at 1.5°C. Given the wide range of environmental and social impacts associated with conventional land-based mining, we believe it is important to ensure that these large amounts of critical metals are sourced with the lowest environmental, social, and economic impacts possible. As the global supply of high-grade ore remains limited and metal demand increases, we can expect a larger environmental and social footprint, potential supply shortages and sustained increases in metal prices should land-based ores remain the only viable source of critical metals, or a more aggressive shift to alternative battery chemistries.
Industries which represent an end-use segment that may require all four critical metals contained in nodules are of particular interest to us and represents potential market opportunities. Most notably, nodules contain metals that can be employed as: (i) feedstock for battery cathode precursors (nickel and cobalt sulfates) for EV and renewable energy storage markets, (ii) copper cathode for EV wiring, clean energy transmission and other applications, and (iii) manganese silicate for manganese alloy production required for steel production. See Section – Competitive Strengths.

Battery Metals and EV Market Opportunity - Global
We believe there will be significant growth in EV demand, with many countries committing to phasing out cars that burn fossil fuels and many original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) devoting significant resources to the electrification of their vehicle offerings. Furthermore, at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) October 2021 meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, governments and major automakers signed a declaration to accelerate the transition to 100% zero-emissions cars and vans by committing to that target by 2040 globally and by 2035 in leading markets. We believe this transition to clean energy and EVs will test the limits of the supply of certain metals where EVs require several times more of these metals (such as nickel, cobalt and copper) than cars with internal combustion engines.

​
Battery Metals and EV Market Opportunity - USA
In August 2021, the United States (“U.S.”) government announced a target of 50% EV sales by 2030. The announcement was followed by a ramp-up of industry commitments to build battery cell manufacturing gigafactories, which are capable of producing large amounts of battery capacity through the entire manufacturing process, in the U.S. which when aggregated with existing gigafactory plans would according to Benchmark Minerals Intelligence represent approximately 703GWh of capacity.

7



In June 2021, the Biden administration’s 100-Day Review of Critical Minerals Supply Chains estimated that fully electrifying U.S. car sales would require 1,273ktpa of Class 1 nickel, 160ktpa of cobalt and 148ktpa of manganese, compared with existing U.S. primary production of 14ktpa of Class 1 nickel, 0.5ktpa of cobalt, and zero primary production of manganese. Across our NORI and TOML contract areas, we have identified 5,555kt of nickel, 813kt of cobalt and 123,920kt of manganese plus 4,709kt of copper, with the potential to take the U.S. from zero or de minimis production of the three namesake elements in the most prominent battery cathode (NMC) to near self-sufficiency or potentially a net export position in each. The opportunity to use seafloor nodule resources to secure battery metal supply lines was recently emphasized in a letter sent to the U.S. Secretary of Defense by 17 retired generals, admirals which echoed similar sentiments to Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska who in February 2021 wrote to the U.S. Secretary of Energy, to say that “new and abundant sources of supply, such as polymetallic nodules, offer a pathway to mineral security for the United States.”
Environmental Market Opportunity
All nickel, cobalt, copper and manganese going into EVs today are produced from land-based ores or recycled scrap. Existing metal stocks available for recycling are insufficient to meet current demand. Even with high end-of-life product recycling rates, most of the new demand over the coming decades will have to be met by new mining. We believe the land mining sector is fundamentally challenged — ore grades are falling, production is moving to some of the more biodiverse and conflict-laden regions in the world (such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia, Philippines and South Africa), accessing ore bodies often requires a complete removal of ecosystems situated on and above such orebodies, and removing, breaking or tunneling through significant tonnage of waste rock. Toxic levels of heavy elements often found in land orebodies typically need to be removed, stored, and maintained indefinitely — a real challenge on seismically active and wet tropical islands in countries like Indonesia that is expected to account for most of future growth in nickel supply.
Although as a result of a vigorous campaign by several non-governmental organizations, several participants in the EV supply chain including Volvo, BMW, Volkswagen and Samsung SDI have recently signed a call for a general precautionary moratorium on all forms of deep seabed mining until all other alternative sources are sufficiently explored and research has clearly demonstrated that deep seabed mining activities can be managed in a way that ensures effective protection of the marine environment we believe that battery metal production specifically from deep-sea polymetallic nodules provides an opportunity to significantly compress most lifecycle environmental, social and governance (ESG) impacts associated with conventional metal production from land-based ores.

8



To quantify comparative ESG footprints of metal production from nodules as compared to conventional land ores, we commissioned several lifecycle assessments (LCAs) looking at the cradle-to-gate impacts of producing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese products for “1 billion EVs by 2050” scenario. An LCA white paper looking at a comprehensive set of impacts was commissioned by us and co-authored by certain of our executive officers in 2018 and reviewed by subject matter specialists and published on our website in April 2020, an LCA research paper focusing on climate change impacts was peer-reviewed and published in the Elsevier Journal of Cleaner Production in December 2020 and an LCA research paper focusing on solid waste streams was peer-reviewed and was published in the Yale Journal of Industrial Ecology in January 2022. Based on these LCA assessments that we commissioned and certain of our executive officers co-authored, we believe that we are positioned to become one of the lowest ESG footprint metal companies in the industry, offering an expected 70-99% reduction of most lifecycle ESG impacts as outlined in the table below. While most of these reductions are attributable to the unique characteristics of the polymetallic nodule resource as described above, the elimination of solid processing waste streams onshore is due to our investment in a near-zero-waste flowsheet design and low carbon emissions are due to our commitment to locate onshore processing facilities in places with access to renewable power.

​

Uncertainty around each LCA indicator is discussed at length in the April 2020 white paper, the December 2020 climate change impacts paper and January 2022 waste impacts paper. Land-based estimates were derived from public LCA databases that contain robust data for metals like nickel and copper; estimates for metals like manganese and cobalt where data in public LCA databases was sparse were augmented with more recent data from peer-reviewed research. Nodule-related estimates were based on technical scoping studies for our offshore and onshore production system that formed the basis of the Canadian NI-43-101 compliant preliminary economic assessment for NORI Area D (2019). The indicators with the highest level of uncertainty for both supply scenarios — land ores and nodules — were impacts on biodiversity and the risk of biodiversity loss. This type of data is not captured in public LCA databases and is further complicated by methodological difficulties of comparing marine and terrestrial life.
The CCZ abyssal plains are one of the most common and least populated habitats on the planet, akin to barren deserts on land. The CCZ abyssal seafloor is plant-free, food-poor and dominated by bacterial life forms. It has been studied extensively since the 1960s with over 13,000 papers published on polymetallic nodules in general and over 1,500 on CCZ nodules in particular. Still more research is underway. We, through our subsidiaries, completed 18 campaigns totaling 710 days at sea.
The largest driver of uncertainty is our ability to measure biodiversity itself. Unlike biodiversity, biomass, measured as carbon contained in live organisms per m2 of habitat, is easier to measure and compare. We believe that the CCZ is one of lowest biomass places on the planet. Metal production from nodules will reduce biomass at risk by over 90% compared to producing the same amount of metals from conventional land ores. Biodiversity, defined as species richness, however, is much harder to measure. We believe the assessment of biodiversity in the CCZ is similar to measuring biodiversity on land where a large portion of species remains undescribed despite 250 years of taxonomic classification effort.
As a precautionary environmental management and protection measure, the ISA has already set aside 1.97 million km2 or 43% of the CCZ as protected areas, or Areas of Particular Environmental Interest (APEIs) aiming to ensure that all types of habitats that could be impacted by exploitation are represented within APEIs. For comparison, only 7.7% of global oceans are protected today and the global targets currently being discussed by certain stakeholders aim to protect 30% of the oceans by 2030. Additional marine impact mitigation measures such as setting aside more areas inside our contract areas and leaving partial nodule cover inside collection areas to aid natural recovery of bacterial and other communities are also being evaluated. We are collaborating with some of the world’s leading researchers to conduct environmental baseline and collection impact studies in order to design plans that could mitigate marine impacts of nodule collection through collection system design and adaptive management systems.

10



It is also worth noting that if the entire CCZ area currently under exploration (1.28 million km2) were to be exploited over a 30-year period, these nodule collection operations would impact 42,500 km2 of the abyssal seafloor per year in one of the least productive areas of the ocean (with respect to the abundance of marine life). This is less than 1% of the estimated 4,900,000 km2 of the seafloor currently impacted every year by trawling operations that take place primarily in highly productive coastal waters.

​
Potential future commercial-scale nodule collection operations in the CCZ are certain to disturb wildlife in the operating area. The nature and severity of these impacts on CCZ wildlife are expected to vary by species and are currently subject to significant uncertainty. Our studies baselining wildlife and ecosystem function, piloting the nodule collection system and assessing impacts arising from the use of this system are currently in progress. Given the significant volume of deep water and the difficulty of sampling or retrieving biological specimens in the CCZ, a complete biological inventory might never be established. Accordingly, impacts on CCZ biodiversity may never be, completely and definitively known. For the same reasons, it may also not be possible to definitively establish whether the impact of nodule collection on global biodiversity will be less significant than those estimated for land-based mining for a similar amount of produced metal.
It is also currently not definitively known how effectively the risk of biodiversity loss in the CCZ could be eliminated or reduced through mitigation strategies or how long it will take for disturbed seabed areas to recover naturally. Prior research indicates that the density, diversity and function of fauna representing most of the resident biomass (including mobile, pelagic and microbial life) are expected to recover naturally over years to decades. However, a high level of uncertainty exists around recovery of fauna that requires the hard substrate of nodules for critical life function. The extent to which planned measures such as leaving behind partial nodule cover and setting aside no-take zones would aid recruitment and recovery of nodule-dependent species in impacted areas will depend on factors like habitat connectivity, which is an area that is still under study.
We are still in the exploration phase of the project and have not yet obtained the necessary permitting and licenses necessary to commence commercial-scale nodule collection operations in the CCZ nor have we obtained the applicable environmental permits and other permits required to build and operate commercial scale polymetallic nodule processing and refining plants on land.

All extractive industries result in impacts to the receiving environment. Nodule collection is no exception and will impact the deep-sea marine environment through nodule removal, disturbance of seafloor sediment and return of seawater used for nodule transport that is expected to contain residual sediment and nodule fines back in the water column (“plumes”). Baselining the impacted marine environment by characterizing the ecosystem and then developing measures to avoid and mitigate these impacts is the central focus of our Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (“ESIA”) program currently being undertaken in partnership with some of the world’s leading deep-sea research institutions. Nodule removal will impact species that depend on the hard nodule substrate for attachment. The severity of the impact will depend on (1) the extent to which these species are represented in the APEIs set aside by the ISA and additional no-take zones set aside by us and (2) the extent to which residual nodule cover will aid recruitment and recovery of these species in impacted areas. Disturbance of the seafloor by collector robots is expected to disturb (mostly microbial) organisms living in and on the sediments. Impact severity will depend on the depth of sediment disturbance (expected to be approximately 5 cm based on modelling, lab tests, and recent collector tests completed in the CCZ by two other nodule contract-holders, Belgium’s Global Sea Mineral Resources NV(GSR) and the German’s BGR) and the impact this disturbance has on benthic ecosystem function. Over 90% of the entrained sediment is expected to be separated from nodules inside the collector robot and discharged behind the collector robot, most settling back to the seafloor within a few hundred meters. The impact of the residual plume will depend on how quickly the smaller mobile sediment particles re-settle, how far they travel and how the resulting sedimentation impacts the benthic organisms. Less than 10% of entrained sediment that will likely evade separation inside the collector robot will be transported with nodules and seawater through the riser pipe to the surface production vessel where nodules get dewatered and residual water, sediment and nodules fines will be returned at some depth in the water column below the highly populated photic zone. Potential impacts from the mid-water sediment plume could include clogging of the delicate respiratory and filter feeding structures of pelagic zooplankton species, such as jellyfish and krill. However, the mid-water discharge is expected to have very low solid particle concentration and dilute to low levels within minutes. The depth of discharge will be selected based on ESIA results to minimize impact on life in the midwater column.
Competitive Strengths
We believe we are well positioned to meet the growing demand for critical battery metals:

● | Increasing demand: The response to the climate change crisis is accelerating demand for EVs, renewable energy storage and infrastructure. In August 2021, the U.S. government announced a target of 50% EV sales by 2030. The announcement was followed by a ramp-up of industry commitments to build battery cell manufacturing gigafactories in the U.S. In October 2021, most of the world’s nations and automakers at COP26 in Glasgow committed to 100% EV sales by 2035 in leading markets and by 2040 globally. To manufacture battery cells, gigafactories will need critical battery metals like nickel, cobalt, manganese and copper to meet rising battery demand.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rising battery metal and battery cell prices: Commodity prices for metals like nickel and copper have recently reached multi-year highs and battery cell production costs are rising for the first time since the introduction of gigafactories going back in 2014.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Availability of abundant and high-grade resource off the U.S. western seaboard: There are four critical battery metals (nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese) in relatively high concentrations in a single nodule resource and we believe our contract areas have estimated in situ quantities of these metals in quantities equivalent to the requirement for 280 million EVs, roughly the size of the entire U.S. passenger vehicle fleet on the road today.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Opportunity to re-shore battery metal production in the U.S.: Current supply chain of battery materials to the U.S. is approximately 50,000 miles long and is predominantly controlled by nations and companies outside of the U.S., which is leading to increasing concerns about supply chain security in the U.S. and interest in breaking the U.S. mineral dependence by re-shoring battery material supply chain in the U.S. Our estimated resource is 1,300 nautical miles from San Diego and we believe we can eventually process and refine our polymetallic nodules in the U.S. which could potentially decrease the supply chain in the U.S. to 1,500 miles.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Opportunity to reuse existing assets and skills: We believe the downturn in new offshore oil and gas exploration is creating an opportunity for us to partner with offshore service providers with deep operational experience in subsea environments gained in the oil and gas industry and with existing assets that can be repurposed for our offshore operations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12




● | Lower expected production cost: At our potential steady state production (expected to be approximately 12.5Mtpa of wet nodules from 2030 to 2045), we expect to be the second lowest cost nickel producer in the world (which includes the sale of byproducts).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lower expected environmental, social and governance footprint: Based on several Lifecycle Assessments (“LCAs”) and that we commissioned and certain of our executive officers co-authored, we expect a potential 70-99% reduction of most lifecycle environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) impacts as compared to metal production from conventional land sources by developing a new type of high-grade multi-metal source found on the abyssal plain - a low biomass, low carbon sequestration deep-sea environment removed from human settlement.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Business Combination
On September 9, 2021, we completed the Business Combination with SOAC. The transaction resulted in the combined company being renamed “TMC the metals company Inc.” and the combined company’s common shares and warrants to purchase common shares commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) on September 10, 2021, under the symbols “TMC” and “TMCWW,” respectively.
Exploration Contracts
We currently hold exclusive exploration rights through our subsidiaries in NORI and TOML and exclusive commercial rights through agreement with Marawa, to certain polymetallic nodule areas in the CCZ.
NORI.    NORI our wholly-owned subsidiary, holds exploration rights to four blocks (NORI Area A, B, C, and D, the “NORI Contract Area”) covering 74,830 km2 in the CCZ that were granted by the ISA in July 2011. NORI is sponsored by Nauru pursuant to a certificate of sponsorship signed by the Government of Nauru on April 11, 2011. The D block of the NORI area (“NORI Area D”) is the seafloor parcel where we have performed the most resource definition and environmental work to date. NORI commissioned AMC Consulting Ltd, a leading mining consulting firm (AMC), to undertake a preliminary economic assessment (“PEA”) of the mineral resource contained in NORI Area D and to compile a technical report compliant with Canadian National Instrument (NI 43-101), which was completed in March 2021. AMC subsequently compiled the NORI Technical Report Summary, dated March 2021, which included an initial assessment and an economic analysis of NORI Area D prepared in accordance with the SEC’s Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants set forth in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (the “SEC Mining Rules”). The NORI Technical Report Summary is filed as Exhibit 96.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
TOML.    TOML our wholly-owned subsidiary which we acquired in March 2020, holds exploration rights to an area covering 74,713 km2 in the CCZ that were granted by the ISA in January 2012 (the “TOML Contract Area”). On March 8, 2008, Tonga and TOML entered into a sponsorship agreement formalizing certain obligations of the parties in relation to TOML’s exploration application to the ISA (subsequently granted) for the TOML Contract Area. The sponsorship agreement was updated on September 23, 2021. TOML commissioned a Technical Report Summary by AMC, dated March 2021, which is filed as Exhibit 96.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

13



Marawa.    DGE, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into agreements with Marawa and Kiribati which provide DGE with exclusive exploration rights to an area covering 74,990 km2 in the CCZ (the “Marawa Contract Area”). The exploration contract between Marawa and the ISA (the “Marawa Exploration Contract”) was signed on January 19, 2015. To date, very limited offshore marine resource definition activities in the Marawa Contract Area have occurred and we expect to commit future resources as contractually agreed with Marawa to evaluate the future commercial viability of any project in such area. We have not completed adequate exploration to establish the economic viability of any project in the Marawa Contract Area. Further work will need to be conducted in order to assess the viability of any potential project in the Marawa Contract Area and such work may take several years until such assessment can be made. Marawa has delayed certain of its efforts in the Marawa Contract Area while it determines how it will move forward with additional assessment work.

​
Business Strategy
Our contemplated business spans the entire lifecycle from the resource acquisition and definition stage through the collection and transportation phases into the processing and refining of nodules onshore and finally in product marketing and offtake (and eventually recycling of end-of-life products containing nodule-derived metals). NORI and TOML, two of our subsidiaries, intend to operate in the CCZ under the effective supervision, regulation and sponsorship of the government of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga, respectively. We intend to engage in processing operations in locations that are yet to be determined. We have chosen an asset-light approach to our operations and have focused on forming deep strategic partnerships with leading offshore and onshore companies in every aspect of our operations.
Our key strategic alliances in 2021 included:
Allseas. Allseas Group S.A. (Allseas), a leading global offshore contractor, is developing the pilot collection system, which is expected to be modified into the initial smaller scale commercial production system and serve as the basis for the design of a full-scale commercial production system.

14



Maersk. Maersk Supply Service NS (Maersk), a leading offshore marine services company, provided us with vessel operations and project management services for resource definition and environmental offshore campaigns between 2018 and 2021. Our agreement with Maersk ended pursuant to its terms in January 2022 following the completion of all NORI Area D baseline campaigns. We have solicited proposals from third parties to provide a survey vessel and specialized services required to support the implementation of the collector test monitoring survey planned for 2022 discussed below.
Glencore: Glencore International AG (Glencore) holds offtake rights on 50% of the NORI nickel and copper production.
In addition, we have worked with an engineering firm Hatch Ltd. (Hatch) and consultants Kingston Process Metallurgy Inc. (KPM) to develop a near-zero solid waste flowsheet. The pyromet stages of the flowsheet were tested as part of our pilot plant program at FLSmidth & Co. A/S’s and XPS Solutions’ (Glencore subsidiary) facilities and hydromerallurgical refining stages are being carried out at SGS SA. The near-zero solid waste flowsheet is the process design that is expected to serve as the basis for our onshore processing facilities.
Phased Project Development
Currently, we are an exploration stage company with a completed initial assessment, working towards a pre-feasibility study. We expect to enter into the feasibility study phase in 2023 following completion of the pilot collection test with Allseas in the CCZ. Having significantly advanced resource definition and environmental baseline studies on NORI Area D, we intend to apply for an exploitation contract on that area first. If we obtain an exploitation contract, we then plan to start with a small-scale commercial production (“Project Zero”) in 2024 in which we expect to collect and process up to 1.3Mtpa of wet nodules. Subject to the success of Project Zero and any regulatory requirements, we then expect to move into the next phase of production (“Project One”) in which we intend to scale up production and expect to collect and process up to approximately 12.5Mtpa of wet nodules at steady state (expected 2030-2045), as outlined in the NORI – D Technical Report Summary.
Current Work Program
We are currently focused on applying for our first exploitation contract from the ISA on the NORI Area D, as defined below, with the goal of potentially starting commercial production in 2024. To reach our objective and initiate commercial production in 2024, we are: (i) defining our resource and project economics, (ii) developing an offshore nodule collection system, (iii) assessing the ESG impacts of offshore nodule collection, and (iv) developing onshore technology to process collected polymetallic nodules into a manganese silicate product, and an intermediate nickel-copper-cobalt matte product and/or end-products like nickel and cobalt sulfates, and copper cathode.

(i) | Resource definition and project economics: Having completed a total of nine offshore resource definition campaigns, collected samples and completed subsea surveys for resource evaluation, we have defined the size and quality of our resource in the NORI and TOML Areas, as described below, in our SEC Regulation S-K (subpart 1300) compliant Technical Report Summary - Initial Assessment of the NORI Property, Clarion-Clipperton Zone, Pacific Ocean dated March 17, 2021 (“NORI Initial Assessment”) and Technical Report Summary - TOML Mineral Resource, Clarion-Clipperton Zone, Pacific Ocean dated March 26, 2021 (“TOML Mineral Resource Statement”), respectively, prepared by AMC. From this work, both NORI and TOML have reported measured, indicated and inferred resources as tabulated below.

We plan to continue to define our resource in the NORI and TOML areas and develop the project economics.

(ii) | Offshore nodule collection system development: We are working with our strategic partner and investor, Allseas, to develop a system to collect, lift and transport nodules from the seafloor to shore. The offshore collection system consists of collector robots on the seafloor, a riser and lift system, and a surface production support vessel. The nodules would be expected to be collected from the seafloor by self-propelled, tracked collector robots using seawater jets aimed at nodules in parallel with the seafloor. No rock cutting, digging, drill-and-blast or other breakage are expected to be required at the point of collection. The collectors would be remotely controlled and supplied with electric power via umbilical cables from the production support vessel. To test the system and assess its environmental impacts, we entered into a contract with Allseas to undertake a pilot trial of the collection system in the NORI Area D in the second half of 2022 (the Pilot Mining Test System or “PMTS”). The successful completion of the PMTS would support our application for an exploitation contract with the ISA. Until the successful completion of the PMTS, Allseas is contracted to cover the development cost associated with the PMTS. We have developed and submitted the Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) for this test to the ISA in July 2021 and submitted a revised EIS in February 2022 following public review. The surface production support vessel, the Hidden Gem, was acquired by Allseas in February 2020 and has strategic importance to us, since it will support the PMTS and is then expected to be upgraded to a small-scale, low-capital early production system. This vessel has undergone modifications in Rotterdam, Netherlands. The pilot collector robot has been assembled at a fabrication facility in Heijningen, Netherlands, has been integrated onto the vessel and is undergoing sea trials. Prior to the planned collector test in the CCZ in the second half of 2022, the Hidden Gem will be used for component testing in the Dutch EEZ and in the Atlantic Ocean.

​

(iii) | Environmental and social impact assessment (“ESIA”) for offshore nodule collection: The ESIA is an integral part of preparing our application for the ISA exploitation contract on the NORI Area D. Our planned ESIA program consists of over 100 discrete studies and relies on the work of several independent deep-sea research institutions. In 2021, our partnership with Maersk enabled us to undertake complex multi-objective offshore campaigns, each with multiple teams of scientists using various types of equipment. The total of eight offshore environmental campaigns (approximately 250 days at sea) focusing on collecting environmental baseline data were expected to be completed by the end of 2021. NORI submitted the EIS for the collector test in July 2021 to the ISA and submitted a revised EIS in February 2022 following public review. The EIS received over 650 comments from a broad group of stakeholders. We submitted our responses to these comments as well as an updated EIS to the ISA on March 1, 2022. Provided that we receive a response from the ISA on the acceptability of the scope of our updated EIS no later than July 2022, we expect that our subsidiary, NORI, will be able to begin its pilot collection test in the second half of 2022. We are currently in the planning stage of the last component of the environmental program: testing the offshore pilot nodule collection system and monitoring its environmental impacts while it collects nodules in the NORI Area D expected to occur in the second half 2022.

​

(iv) | Onshore technology development: To process and refine collected nodules into critical metals, we have developed a flowsheet together with a metallurgical process design firm, Hatch Ltd. (“Hatch”). This flowsheet uses conventional equipment, modified for the unique nature of the polymetallic nodule resource to deliver a process that is expected to generate near zero solid waste. The key products generated by this process are nickel sulfate, cobalt sulfate, copper cathode, manganese silicate and fertilizer-grade ammonium sulfate. The processing flowsheet also provides the potential to generate an intermediate product, a nickel-copper-cobalt matte. Nickel is expected to account for almost half of future production revenues. We have completed lab-scale test work and offshore campaigns to collect a bulk sample for pilot-scale metallurgical testing. We are now in the middle of the pilot plant program. In 2021, we successfully completed calcining and smelting of nodules into a manganese silicate product and nickel-copper-cobalt alloy intermediate, followed by converting and sulfidation of the alloy into matte. We continue testing the hydrometallurgical refining phase where matte is processed to produce nickel sulfate, cobalt sulfate, copper cathode and fertilizer grade ammonium sulfate.

Additionally, we are also engaged in several technical scoping studies for a potential first small-scale production plant in Asia. On March 16, 2022 we announced a business collaboration with Epsilon Carbon Pvt., LTD. (“Epsilon Carbon”) to complete a pre-feasibility study for a commercial polymetallic nodule processing plant in India with the targeted production capacity of more than 30,000 tonnes per annum (TPA) of an intermediate nickel-copper-cobalt matte product used for active cathode material (CAM) for Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) and other nickel-rich cathode chemistries for lithium-ion batteries and more than 750,000 TPA of manganese silicate by-product expected to be used in manganese alloy production for the steel industry (“Project Zero Plant”). Epsilon Carbon intends to deliver a pre-feasibility report (“PFR”) for a potential plant in India powered by renewables and with the targeted processing capacity of 1.3 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of wet nodules and production start in time to receive nodules collected from NORI-D area starting around Q4 2024, subject to TMC’s subsidiary NORI securing an exploitation contract from the ISA. It is anticipated that TMC and Epsilon Carbon will enter binding Heads of Terms for construction and operations of Project Zero Plant by September 30, 2022. TMC and Epsilon Carbon have both agreed not to enter into any binding agreements with any other third party for the construction and operation of a processing plant for polymetallic nodules through the earlier of TMC and Epsilon Carbon entering into binding Heads of Terms with respect to the Project Zero Plant or March 31, 2023.

As reflected in the initial economic analysis of NORI Area D contained in the NORI Technical Report Summary, a discounted cash flow analysis considering the intended pre-development work in 2024, discounting at 9% per annum, and assuming metal prices for nickel metal $16,472/t; nickel in nickel sulfate $18,807/t Ni; copper metal $6,872/t; cobalt metal $46,333/t; cobalt in cobalt sulfate $56,920/t Co; manganese in manganese silicate $4.50/dmtu Mn, indicates a NORI Area D project net present value (as of January 1, 2021) of $6.8 billion. The initial assessment included in the NORI Technical Report Summary is a conceptual study of the potential viability of NORI’s mineral resources. This initial assessment indicates that development of the NORI mineral resource is potentially technically and economically viable; however, due to the preliminary nature of project planning and design, and the untested nature of the specific seafloor production systems at a commercial scale, economic viability has not yet been demonstrated.
The NORI Technical Report Summary and TOML Technical Report Summary do not include the conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves.
You are specifically cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into mineral reserves, as defined by the SEC. You are also cautioned that mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic value. Inferred mineral resources have a high degree of uncertainty as to their existence and to whether they can be economically or legally commercialized. Under the SEC Mining Rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of an economic analysis. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. A significant amount of exploration must be completed in order to determine whether an inferred mineral resource may be upgraded to a higher category. Therefore, you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists, that it can be economically or legally commercialized, or that it will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Approximately 97% of the NORI Area D resource is categorized as measured or indicated.
Likewise, you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated mineral resources will ever be upgraded to mineral reserves.
Collection and Processing of Polymetallic Nodules
Collection and Shipping
We are planning a phased development for NORI Area D. Polymetallic nodules would be collected using offshore collection systems, comprising of collector robots on the seafloor, a riser and lifting system (RALS) in the water column, and a production support vessel on the surface. The nodules are expected to be transferred to transport vessels and shipped to onshore processing facilities.

20



Through our strategic partnership with Allseas, a former drillship vessel (the Hidden Gem) acquired by Allseas in February 2020 has been converted and modified to undertake a pre-production collector test in which a collector vehicle, RALS and other systems will be tested. If we obtain an exploitation contract, the first phase of commercial production (“Project Zero”) would then be expected to commence after the Hidden Gem has been upgraded to become a production support vessel that can produce up to 1.3 Mtpa (wet) of nodules. The nodules collected in Project Zero are expected to be processed through either existing third-party facilities on a tolling basis or alternatively through partnerships to construct new Rotary Kiln-Electric arc Furnace (“RKEF”) facilities. In the next phase of development (“Project One”), as outlined in the NORI – D Initial Assessment Technical Report Summary, production is expected to be expanded with an additional converted drillship (Drill Ship 2), a subsequent upgrade to the Hidden Gem, and the construction of a bespoke production support vessel (Collector Ship 1).

​
The intended seafloor production system operated at 4km depth (picture not to scale)

21



In order to test the collection system, we entered into a contract with Allseas to undertake a pre-production collector test. If such test is successful, we expect that commercial production would then commence after the upgrading of the Hidden Gem into a production vessel. If we obtain an exploitation contract, we expect to collect 1.3 Mtpa (wet) of polymetallic nodules for use in Project Zero. For Project One, we believe that a fleet of three production vessels, each with multiple dedicated seafloor collectors, would be estimated to produce approximately 12.5 Mtpa of wet nodules at steady state (expected 2030-2045), which we intend to process, either at a new facility to be constructed by us or by potential processing partners, subject to available capital, or at third-party facilities pursuant to a toll treatment model.

​
We believe that this phased approach to development allows for proper management of risk and for progressive improvement of engineering and operating systems. The intention is to implement the project in multiple phases that will allow the offshore collection systems to be tested and then polymetallic nodule production to be gradually ramped up. We also believe that this approach will de-risk the project for a relatively low initial capital investment. Additionally, this phased development will allow for an adaptive approach to environmental management providing learning at small-scale which would be applied as production increases in scale.
Mineral Processing and Refining and Metallurgical Testing
Pyrometallurgical processing of polymetallic nodules has been extensively studied since the early 1970s.
From an early stage, we have recognized that processing represents a key to potentially commercializing seafloor polymetallic nodules and to becoming a low-cost producer of nickel, manganese, copper and cobalt products. Moreover, we believe that there is a commercial advantage in positioning ourselves as a leader in the onshore processing of seafloor polymetallic nodules.
To this end, we have been working with a leading global process engineering group Hatch, and a professional services firm, to develop pyrometallurgical processing and hydrometallurgical refining technologies for the production of battery metals feedstocks from nodules. Hatch has developed a near-zero solid waste flowsheet and has overseen a pyrometallurgical pilot plant program consisting of several phases: the pyrometallurgical processing phase has been completed at FLSmidth’s and XPS Solutions’ (Glencore subsidiary) facilities, the hydrometallurgical refining phase is in progress at SGS facilities. Pursuant to an engineering and consulting services agreement, Hatch is assisting and advising us during the development of the pilot test program and is analyzing and interpreting the testing results through reports provided by such test facilities.

22



We expect that the processing of the polymetallic nodules from the NORI Contract Area would also be ramped up in phases. This plan includes initially toll treating polymetallic nodules at existing RKEF plants, utilizing existing excess industry capacity. We believe that there is significant interest to deploy underutilized RKEF plants which may have become stranded as a result of the Indonesian government nickel laterite ore export ban restricting supply of the nickel laterite feedstock that they have previously utilized. These RKEF plants were originally built to convert nickel laterite to nickel pig iron and could potentially be converted to smelt polymetallic nodules. While we have not completed the negotiations of any definitive agreements with RKEF plants, we believe that we may be able to do so in the future on commercially reasonable terms. In parallel, we are actively exploring two additional scenarios of either co-locating new RKEF capacity with a potential future offtake of our manganese silicate product or building a new RKEF plant with a converter isle with a partner willing to finance, build and operate such a facility.
In the future, based on the work performed by Hatch and subject to available capital, we are contemplating the construction of a processing plant(s), which may include pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical circuits. Nodule processing would be increased in phases by treatment in this new plant or plants.
Strategic Alliances and Key Commercial Agreements
Allseas Agreements
On March 29, 2019, we entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement with Allseas, whereby the parties will conduct project development of an integrated offshore nodule collection system for use by our subsidiaries. As initially constituted, Allseas agreed to subscribe for (i) 6,666,667 DeepGreen Common Shares for a purchase price of $20,000,000 in cash (the “Subscription”), the entire amount of which was funded, and (ii) an additional 10,000,000 DeepGreen Common Shares in exchange for services rendered by Allseas in respect of the contemplated pilot mining test system (the “PMTS”), which would be designed, built and tested by Allseas. The 10,000,000 shares would only be issued upon completion of the pilot mining test in the CCZ using the PMTS (the “Success Fee Shares”), along with an additional $30 million cash success fee that would be payable simultaneously therewith. The Strategic Alliance Agreement also contemplated that the parties would enter into other commercial arrangements following the successful completion of the pilot trials of the PMTS in the CCZ.
On July 8, 2019, we and Allseas entered into the Pilot Mining Test Agreement (the “PMTA”), which governed the terms, design specifications, procedures, and timetable under which Allseas agreed to complete the PMTS, to be used by NORI. The PMTA was subsequently amended on September 1, 2019, February 20, 2020, and March 4, 2021. The Strategic Alliance Agreement was also amended on March 4, 2021 (collectively with the PMTA amendment of the same date, the “Amendment”), which Amendment became effective upon closing of the Business Combination. Pursuant to the Amendment, the cash fee payable pursuant to the PMTA was amended such that we would pay to Allseas (i) $10,000,000 on June 30, 2021 (which we subsequently amended with Allseas to change to within 10 business days of the Closing of the Business Combination in a further amendment; this amount was paid on October 5, 2021), (ii) $10,000,000 on the later of January 1, 2022 and such time that confirmation is received with respect to the successful completion of the North Sea drive test, and (iii) $10,000,000 upon successful completion of the pilot trials in the CCZ using the PMTS. Pursuant to the Amendment, except as provided therein, Allseas may not, without our prior written consent, terminate the Strategic Alliance Agreement or the PMTA before NORI receives an ISA exploitation contract.
Also on March 4, 2021, we issued the Allseas Warrant to Allseas, which shall vest upon successful completion of CCZ trial using the PMTS. A maximum of 11.6 million warrants to purchase common shares will vest if the CCZ trals using the PMTS are completed by September 30, 2023, gradually decreasing to 5.8 million warrants to purchase common shares if the CCZ trials using the PMTS are completed after September 30, 2025. The Allseas Warrant was issued to Allseas in lieu of any future obligation to issue the Success Fee Shares. The Allseas Warrant shall vest only upon (and not before) the successful completion of the CCZ trials using the PMTS and will expire on September 30, 2026. The Warrant Credit Value shall be determined as of June 1, 2022, based on the closing trading price of the Common Shares. In the event that the Warrant Credit Value is greater than $150,000,000, then on the vesting date of the Allseas Warrant, we shall receive a “credit” for the amount by which such Warrant Credit Value exceeds $150,000,000. We will be able to exchange such credit value for future goods and services from Allseas. No amount will be due or receivable under the Allseas Warrant if the Warrant Credit Value is under $150,000,000 on June 1, 2022.

23



With respect to Allseas, if the CCZ trials using the PMTS is successfully completed, the PMTA will terminate by its terms, whereas the overarching Strategic Alliance Agreement will remain in place. 
On March 16, 2022, NORI and Allseas entered into a non-binding term sheet for the development and operation of a commercial nodule collection system. The PMTS developed and currently being tested by Allseas is expected to be upgraded to a commercial system with a targeted production capacity of 1.3 Mtpa of wet nodules and expected production readiness by the fourth quarter of 2024 ("Project Zero System"). NORI and Allseas intend to equally finance all costs related to developing and getting Project Zero System into production currently estimated at less than EUR100 million. It is anticipated that NORI will not have to make any Project Zero System-related payments to Allseas until March 31, 2023. Once in production, NORI expects to pay Allseas a nodule collection and transshipment fee estimated at approximately EUR 150 per wet tonne in the first year of operations and expected to be reduced by more than 20% in the following years as Allseas scales up production to 1.3 Mtpa of wet nodules. The parties intend to further detail and revise these cost estimates in the definitive agreement contemplated by the non-binding term sheet, which the parties expect to enter into no later than December 31, 2022 following the completion of the pilot collection tests. Subject to the necessary regulatory approvals, Allseas and NORI also intend to investigate acquiring a second production vessel similar to the Hidden Gem, a Samsung 10000, with the potential for it to be engineered to support a higher production rate of 3 million tonnes of wet nodules per year and lower associated per tonne production cost. There can be no assurances, however, that we will enter into definitive agreements with Allseas contemplated by the non-binding term sheet in a particular time period, or at all, or on terms similar to those set forth in the non-binding term sheet, or that if such definitive agreements are entered into by us that the proposed commercial systems and second production vessel will be successfully developed or operated in a particular time period, or at all.
Offtake Agreements
On May 25, 2012, our wholly-owned subsidiary, DGE, and Glencore, entered into a copper offtake agreement and a separate nickel offtake agreement (together, the “Glencore Offtake Agreements”), pursuant to which Glencore has the right to purchase from DGE 50% of the annual quantity of copper material and 50% of the annual quantity of nickel material produced by DGE from ore derived from the NORI Contract Area at a processing plant directly owned or controlled by DGE. Pursuant to the Glencore Offtake Agreements, for London Metal Exchange (“LME”) Codelco registered Grade “A” copper cathodes, the delivered price is the official LME Copper Grade “A” Cash Settlement quotation as published in the London Metal Bulletin averaged over the month of shipment or the following month at Glencore’s choice, plus the official long-term contract premium as announced annually by Codelco, basis CIF Main European Ports (Rotterdam, the Netherlands). For LME Registered Primary Nickel, the delivered price is the official LME Primary Nickel Cash Settlement averaged over the month of shipping or the following month at Glencore’s choice. For other copper-bearing material and other nickel-bearing material, the parties shall agree a price annually for the forthcoming calendar year on the basis of prevailing market prices for such copper products and such nickel products. The Glencore Offtake Agreements are for the life of the NORI Contract Area, and either party may terminate the agreement upon a material breach or insolvency of the other party. Glencore may also terminate either agreement by giving 12 months’ prior written notice. The Glencore Offtake Agreements do not extend to any other of our entities in the event other entities are the ultimate processing owners for metal products. The Glencore Offtake Agreements only apply with respect to metals processed and developed from the NORI areas that are processed by a facility owned or controlled by DGE and do not apply to other projects (including for example Marawa or TOML). Concurrent with entering into the Glencore Offtake Agreements, Glencore made an equity investment of $5 million into our company.
Non-Binding Memorandum of Understanding with Epsilon Carbon Pvt, LTD.
On March 16, 2022, we announced a business collaboration with Epsilon Carbon through the signing of a non-binding memorandum of understanding under which Epsilon Carbon intends to complete a pre-feasibility study for a commercial polymetallic nodule processing plant in India with the targeted production capacity of more than 30,000 tonnes per annum (TPA) of an intermediate nickel-copper-cobalt matte product used for active cathode material (CAM) for Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) and other nickel-rich cathode chemistries for lithium-ion batteries and more than 750,000 TPA of manganese silicate by-product expected to be used in manganese alloy production for the steel industry (“Project Zero Plant”). Epsilon Carbon intends to deliver a pre-feasibility report (“PFR”) for a plant in India powered by renewables and with the targeted processing capacity of 1.3 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of wet nodules and production start in time to receive nodules collected from NORI Area D starting around the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to TMC’s subsidiary NORI securing an exploitation contract from the ISA. It is anticipated that TMC and Epsilon Carbon will enter binding Heads of Terms for construction and operations of Project Zero Plant by September 30, 2022. TMC and Epsilon Carbon have both agreed not to enter into any binding agreements with any other third party for the construction and operation of a processing plant for polymetallic 

24



nodules through the earlier of TMC and Epsilon Carbon entering into binding Heads of Terms with respect to the Project Zero Plant or March 31, 2023. There can be no assurance that we will enter into such Heads of Terms or subsequent definitive agreement(s) in a particular time period, or at all, or on terms similar to those set forth in the memorandum of understanding, or that if such Heads of Terms or definitive agreement(s) are entered into by us that the proposed plant will be financed, engineered, permitted, constructed, operated or supplied in a particular time period, or at all, or successfully.
Competition
The metals production industry is capital intensive and competitive. Production of battery materials and manganese alloys is largely dominated by Chinese competitors. These competitors may have greater financial resources, as well as other strategic advantages to operate, maintain, improve and possibly expand their facilities. Additionally, domestic Chinese resources firms have historically been able to produce minerals and/or process metals from land-based operations at relatively low costs due to domestic economic and regulatory factors, including less stringent environmental and governmental regulations and lower labor and benefit costs. We may be unable to compete successfully with these and other competitors, including other land-based mining operations. In addition to three contracts held by TMC’s subsidiaries and partners, 16 other entities (ISA Member States and private companies sponsored by ISA Member States) currently hold ISA Exploration Contracts for polymetallic nodules. If and when they move into the exploitation phase, each of these contract-holders could become potential competitors with respect to the collection of polymetallic nodules and the production of nickel, manganese, copper and cobalt products. Furthermore, several nation states are working on developing polymetallic nodule resources inside their EEZs, with the Cook Islands granting three exploration contracts for polymetallic nodules in February 2022. There is increasing competition from new and existing marine mineral players for the availability of marine exploration and support vessels, related marine equipment and specialized personnel, desirable exploration areas, suitable offshore collection and onshore processing equipment, and available capital. Some of our competitors may equally find more promising resources, identify or develop more economic technologies, enter into strategic partnerships that constrain our optionality, or may develop novel methods to collect nodules from the seafloor or process nodules into metals that are more economic than we currently contemplate.

UNCLOS deals with, among other things, navigational rights, territorial sea limits, exclusive economic zone jurisdiction, the continental shelf, freedom of the high seas, legal status of resources on the seabed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, passage of ships through narrow straits, conservation and management of living marine resources in the high seas, protection of the marine environment, marine scientific research, and settlement of disputes.

Part XI of UNCLOS and the 1994 Implementation Agreement deal with mineral exploration and collection in the international seabed, known as the Area, providing a framework for entities to obtain legal title to areas of the seafloor from the ISA for the purpose of exploration and eventually collection of resources. UNCLOS became effective on November 16, 1994. A subsequent agreement relating to the implementation of Part XI of UNCLOS was adopted on July 28, 1994 and became effective on July 28, 1996. The 1994 Implementation Agreement and Part XI of UNCLOS are to be interpreted and applied together as a single instrument. As of August 20, 2020, UNCLOS had been signed by 167 States (countries) and the European Union.
International Seabed Authority
The ISA is an autonomous international organization established under UNCLOS and the 1994 Implementation Agreement to organize and control activities in the Area, particularly with a view to administering and regulating the development of the resources of the Area, in accordance with the legal regime established under UNCLOS and the 1994 Implementation Agreement. The ISA is comprised of UNCLOS signatories, 167 Member States, and the European Union. All parties to UNCLOS are members of the ISA. The ISA is mandated as the organization through which parties to UNCLOS shall organize and control all mineral-related activities in the Area. Two principal entities establish the policies and govern the work of the ISA: the Assembly, where all 167 members are represented (the “Assembly”), and a 37-member council elected by the Assembly (the “Council”). The Council has two advisory bodies: the Legal Technical Commission (LTC) (30 members), which advises the Council on all matters relating to the exploration and collection of non-living marine resources, such as polymetallic nodules, polymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts, and the Finance Committee (15 members), which deals with budgetary and related matters.
All rules, regulations, and procedures issued by the ISA to regulate prospecting, exploration, and collection of marine minerals are issued within a general legal framework established by UNCLOS and the 1994 Implementation Agreement. To date, the ISA has issued the following regulations (https://www.isa.org.jm/mining-code/Regulations):

● | The Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Nodules in the CCZ (adopted July 13, 2000, as amended in 2013; the Regulations).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Sulphides (adopted May 7, 2010).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Cobalt-Rich Ferromanganese Crusts in the CCZ (July 2012).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No commercial polymetallic nodule collection operations have started anywhere in the world. Currently, exploration activities undertaken are aimed at gathering the necessary information on the location and quality of the minerals of the seabed as well as collecting all the necessary environmental information. To date, the ISA has approved 17 contracts in the CCZ for exploration of nodules, one in the Indian Ocean and one in the Western Pacific Ocean covering more than 1.35 million square kilometers of the seabed. This represents only 0.3 percent of the world’s oceans. Twelve of these contracts are sponsored by developing countries (including the sponsors of our subsidiaries NORI — Nauru, and TOML — Tonga, and our partner Marawa which is sponsored by the Republic of Kiribati). Thirteen countries and one intergovernmental consortium currently have contracts for the exploration of polymetallic nodules, seven countries have contracts for the exploration of polymetallic sulphides, and five countries have contracts for the exploration of cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts. To date, no exploitation contracts for extracting minerals from the seafloor within the CCZ have been granted. The ISA is currently working on the development of a legal framework to regulate the commercialization of mineral development activities, as described below.
In 2014, the ISA completed a study looking at comparative extractive regulatory regimes. This was followed in March 2014 with a stakeholder survey seeking comments on what financial, environmental, and health and safety obligations should be included under the framework (ISA 2014).
In August 2017, the Council released the first Draft Regulations on Exploitation of Mineral Resources in the CCZ, as subsequently amended. In March 2019, the Council released the advance and unedited text (English only) of the Draft Regulations on Exploitation of Mineral Resources in the CCZ (ISBA/25/LTC/WP.1) (ISA, 2018). The revised draft exploitation regulations incorporated the consideration of requests addressed to the LTC by the Council during the first part of the 24th Session in March 2018, as well as certain comments by the Commission, and also reflected the responses to the first draft from stakeholder submissions. The exploitation regulations will create the legal and technical framework for collection and related operations. Finalization of the exploitation regulations remains subject to the decision of the members of the ISA. Final exploitation regulations must be adopted by the Council. The ISA was intending to have these regulations finalized by July 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted ISA meetings and discussions.
The current proposed application process in the draft exploitation regulations consists of the following:

We are still in the exploration phase of the project and have not yet obtained an exploitation contract from the ISA (“ISA Exploitation Contract”) to commence commercial-scale polymetallic nodule collection in the CCZ. An ISA exploitation contract application is comprised of several components, including an EIS for the proposed commercial operations, the end-product of a comprehensive ESIA program. In addition, we have also not yet obtained the applicable environmental permits and other permits required to build and operate commercial scale polymetallic nodule processing and refining plants on land.
However, Section 1, paragraph 15 of the 1994 Agreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the UNCLOS allows a member state whose national intends to apply for approval of a plan of work for exploitation to notify the ISA of such intention. This notice obliges the ISA to complete the adoption of exploitation regulations within two years of the request made by the member state.

27



On June 25, 2021, the Republic of Nauru submitted its notice to the ISA requesting that it complete, by July 9, 2023, the adoption of regulations necessary to facilitate the approval of plans of work for the commercial exploitation of polymetallic nodules. The notice submitted by the Republic of Nauru to the ISA has increased the likelihood that regulations will be adopted that will govern and enable commercial scale polymetallic nodule collection by mid-2023. If the ISA has not completed the adoption of such regulations within the prescribed time and an application for approval of a plan of work for exploitation is pending before the ISA, the ISA shall nonetheless consider and provisionally approve such plan of work based on: (i) the provisions of the UNCLOS; (ii) any rules, regulations and procedures that the ISA may have adopted provisionally at the time, (iii) the basis of the norms contained in the UNCLOS and (iv) the principle of non-discrimination among contractors.
In December 2021, the ISA held face to face meetings in Kingston Jamaica and established an ambitious work plan and road map to finalize regulations by July 2023 for the commercial exploitation of seabed minerals, including those necessary for the collection of polymetallic nodules. The road map includes two, two-week sessions of Council and one week of Assembly meetings that will be focused primarily on the finalization of the regulations in 2022. The road map also provides for a third two-week Council session in the fourth quarter of 2022, if required and subject to resources. Once adopted, these regulations will create the legal and technical framework for exploitation of the polymetallic nodules in the NORI, TOML and Marawa Contract Areas.
While, the ISA has developed a work plan and road map to complete the Final Regulations by July 2023, there can be no assurance that such regulations will be approved then, or at all. The Draft Regulations and several supporting standards and guidelines are at an advanced stage, but there remains uncertainty regarding the final form that these will take as well as the impact that such regulations, standards and guidelines will have on our ability to meet our objectives.
The NORI Exploration Contract
In July 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary, NORI, was granted a polymetallic nodule exploration contract by the ISA, providing it exclusive rights to explore 74,830 km2 in the CCZ pursuant to the NORI Exploration Contract (“NORI Exploration Contract”). The NORI Exploration Contract was approved by the Council on July 19, 2011, and entered into on July 22, 2011 between NORI and the ISA, and terminates on July 22, 2026, subject to extension.
The NORI Exploration Contract, which was granted pursuant to the ISA’s Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Nodules in the CCZ (the “Regulations”), formalized a 74,830 km2 exploration area, has an initial term of 15 years (subject to renewal for successive five-year periods), and provides for certain obligations with respect to exploration, training, and other programs of activities for an initial five-year period. The NORI Exploration Contract also formalized the rights of NORI around future rights. Pursuant to the Regulations, NORI has the priority right to apply for an exploitation contract to collect polymetallic nodules in the same area (Regulation 24(2)). Such preference or priority may be withdrawn by the Council if the contractor has failed to comply with the requirements of its approved plan of work for exploration within the time period specified in a written notice or notices from the Council to the contractor indicating which requirements have not been complied with by the contractor. After a hearing process, the Council would be required to provide the reasons for its proposed withdrawal of preference or priority and shall consider any contractor’s response. The decision of the Council shall take account of that response and shall be based on substantial evidence. As soon as practicable, NORI intends to submit an application to collect polymetallic nodules in the same area as its current exploration rights. To date, no exploitation contracts for extracting minerals from the international seafloor have been granted. The ISA is currently working on the development of a legal framework to regulate the exploitation of polymetallic nodules in the Area, as described above.
In March 2016, NORI submitted to the ISA its proposed activities for the second five-year period of its exploration contract. NORI indicated that work during such period would focus on:

● | reducing project uncertainties and technical risks;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | optimizing the onshore processing and offshore production systems (including increasing performance and reliability); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improving project economics, including decreasing estimated capital and operating expenditures as well as increasing projected revenues.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

28



NORI proposed various activities under that submission, which have been undertaken and are continuing to be undertaken. Such work has included improving metal recovery from the hydrometallurgical process then being developed, including studies to improve efficiencies, reduce costs, and increase revenue streams. During the course of this second five-year period, the metallurgical process flow sheet was revised to result in perceived lower-risk and no solid waste, and a pyrometallurgical/hydrometallurgical flowsheet was developed. Studies have also been carried out to identify potential sites for processing plants. A program of offshore campaigns has been and is in the process of being implemented, resulting in a comprehensive environmental baseline study program involving in excess of 100 separate studies from world leading researchers and institutions. This program is intended to inform NORI’s ESIA and EMMP submissions to the ISA and assist in its design and plans to manage and mitigate potential environmental impacts from operations.
NORI commenced a pre-feasibility study to analyze technical and economic viability of the collection system and metallurgical process, and revised capital and operating costs.
NORI also proposed and has implemented or will implement a range of activities pertaining to the collector test: (i) identification and ground truthing of areas potentially suitable for the collector test; (ii) confirmation of a collector test site; (iii) commencement of the environmental baseline studies pertaining to the collector EIA program; and (iv) commencing geotechnical studies pertaining to the collector test program. On July 29, 2021, NORI submitted its EIS on the NORI Collector Test for consideration by the ISA.
In 2021, NORI submitted a review of the implementation of the plan of work for the period from 2017to 2021 to the ISA. The review included a proposed plan of work for the next five-year period from 2022 to 2026. On February 3, 2022, the ISA confirmed that the Secretariat and Commission had reviewed NORI’s report and noted that the program of activities for the next five-year period was acceptable. The ISA requested clarification on a few matters and noted that the periodic review would be concluded if the clarifications were received within 30 days. On February 28, 2022, NORI provided the clarification in response to the request by the ISA.
The ISA Council may suspend or terminate the NORI Exploration Contract, without prejudice to any other rights that the ISA may have, if any of the following events should occur:

● | if, in spite of written warnings by the ISA, NORI has conducted its activities in such a way as to result in serious persistent and willful violations of the fundamental terms of the NORI Exploration Contract, Part XI of UNCLOS, the 1994 Agreement and the rules, regulations and procedures of the ISA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if NORI has failed to comply with a final binding decision of the dispute settlement body applicable to it; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if NORI becomes insolvent or commits an act of bankruptcy or enters into any agreement for composition with its creditors or goes into liquidation or receivership, whether compulsory or voluntary, or petitions or applies to any tribunal for the appointment of a receiver or a trustee or receiver for itself or commences any proceedings relating to itself under any bankruptcy, insolvency or readjustment of debt law, whether now or hereafter in effect, other than for the purpose of reconstruction.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, if the nationality or control of NORI changes or NORI’s Sponsoring State, as defined in the Regulations, terminates its sponsorship and NORI does not obtain another sponsor meeting the requirements prescribed in the Regulations, then the NORI Exploration Contract will terminate.
The NORI Sponsorship Agreement
NORI is sponsored by Nauru pursuant to a certificate of sponsorship signed by the Government of Nauru on April 11, 2011. NORI is a Nauruan incorporated entity and is subject to applicable Nauruan legislation and regulations. In 2015, the Nauruan government established the Nauru Seabed Minerals Authority to regulate activities carried out by companies sponsored by Nauru.
Throughout the period of the NORI Exploration Contract, NORI must be sponsored by a State that is party to UNCLOS. If the nationality or control of NORI changes or NORI’s Sponsoring State, as defined in the Regulations, terminates its sponsorship, NORI must promptly notify the ISA. In either event, if NORI does not obtain another sponsor meeting the requirements prescribed in the Regulations and fails to submit to the ISA a certificate of sponsorship for NORI in the prescribed form within six months, the NORI Exploration Contract will terminate.

29



On June 5, 2017, Nauru, the Nauru Seabed Minerals Authority and NORI entered into a sponsorship agreement (the “NORI Sponsorship Agreement”) formalizing certain obligations of the parties in relation to NORI’s exploration and potential collection of the NORI Contract Area of the CCZ. The NORI Sponsorship Agreement will remain in force for the duration of the 15-year NORI Exploration Contract and will automatically extend for a further 20 years upon NORI reaching the minimum recovery level under an ISA Exploitation Contract, unless earlier terminated by the ISA as a result of NORI’s breach of the NORI Exploration Contract or pursuant to its terms. Upon reaching the minimum recovery level within the tenement area, NORI will pay Nauru a seabed mineral recovery payment based on the polymetallic nodules recovered from the tenement area. In addition, NORI will pay an administration fee each year to Nauru for such administration and sponsorship, which is subject to review and increase in the event that NORI is granted an ISA Exploitation Contract.
During exploration, NORI is required to, among other things:

● | submit an annual report to the ISA;
--+------------------------------------


● | meet certain performance and expenditure commitments;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | pay an annual overhead charge to cover the costs incurred by the ISA in administering and supervising the contract;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | implement training programs for personnel of the ISA and developing countries in accordance with a training program proposed by NORI in its license application;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | take measures to prevent, reduce, and control pollution and other hazards to the marine environment arising from its activities in the CCZ;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | maintain appropriate insurance policies;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | establish environmental baselines against which to assess the likely effects of its program of activities on the marine environment; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establish and implement a program to monitor and report on such effects.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NORI is sponsored to carry out its mineral exploration activities in the CCZ by Nauru, pursuant to a certificate of sponsorship signed by the Government of Nauru on April 11, 2011. Sponsorship of an entity requires the sponsoring State to certify that it assumes responsibility for the entity’s activities in the CCZ in accordance with UNCLOS. NORI is a Nauruan incorporated entity and is subject to applicable Nauruan legislation and regulations.
The TOML Exploration Contract
In March 2020, we acquired TOML from Deep Sea Mining Finance Limited, providing us with exclusive rights to explore a 74,713 km2 area of the CCZ seabed. TOML holds an exploration contract granted by the ISA and sponsored by the Kingdom of Tonga pursuant to the TOML Exploration Contract (“TOML Exploration Contract”). The plan of work was approved by the Council, acting on the recommendation of the LTC, on July 19, 2011. The TOML Exploration Contract was then signed on January 11, 2012 between TOML and the ISA and terminates on January 11, 2027, subject to a potential extension under the terms of the agreement.

30



The TOML Exploration Contract was granted pursuant to the ISA’s Regulations, as well as Article 153 of UNCLOS, and formalized a 74,713 km2 exploration area. The TOML Exploration Contract includes an initial term of 15 years, which may be extended under the contract, and a program of activities to be completed within the first five-year period of the term. The TOML Exploration Contract also formalized the rights of TOML around future rights. Pursuant to the Regulations, TOML has the priority right to apply for an ISA Exploitation Contract to collect polymetallic nodules in the same area (Regulation 24(2)). The Regulations state that a contractor who has an approved plan of work for exploration only shall have a preference and a priority among applicants submitting plans of work for collection of the same area and resources. Such preference or priority may be withdrawn by the Council if the contractor has failed to comply with the requirements of its approved plan of work for exploration within the time period specified in a written notice or notices from the Council to the contractor indicating which requirements have not been complied with by the contractor. After a hearing process, the Council shall provide the reasons for its proposed withdrawal of preference or priority and shall consider any contractor’s response. The decision of the Council shall take account of that response and shall be based on substantial evidence.
In October 2016 TOML submitted to the ISA its proposed activities for the second five-year period of its exploration contract. TOML indicated that work would focus on:

● | continued development and collection of environmental baseline data;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | completing pilot testing;
--+--------------------------


● | completing geotechnical studies;
--+---------------------------------


● | completing feasibility studies;
--+--------------------------------


● | drafting of the first EIS/EMMP; and
--+------------------------------------


● | continuing training.
--+---------------------

Based on an expectation that the forthcoming environmental regulations pertaining to obtaining an ISA Exploitation Contract were to be completed, TOML submitted a plan that included a substantive program of environmental baseline survey and pilot collection monitoring. It also included fabrication and trials of pilot scale collection equipment, metallurgical test work, and other engineering and marketing studies as well as report drafting for environmental permitting and feasibility study purposes. The designing of TOML’s collection system called the Decoupled Underwater Collection Concept (“DUCC”) did progress to prefeasibility study state. TOML continued to advance its project design by conducting land-based tests and closing technology gaps in areas not previously piloted. A preliminary collection plan and collection equipment/schedule was completed for the TOML preliminary collection areas, but such plans are now subject to change by TOML.
In 2021, TOML submitted a review of the implementation of the plan of work for the period from 2017 to 2021 to the ISA. The review included a proposed plan of work for the next five-year period from2022 to 2026. The ISA is currently reviewing TOML’s review and proposed plan of work and is expected to provide a response in 2022.
The ISA Council may suspend or terminate the TOML Exploration Contract, without prejudice to any other rights that the ISA may have, if any of the following events should occur:

● | if, in spite of written warnings by the ISA, TOML has conducted its activities in such a way as to result in serious persistent and willful violations of the fundamental terms of this contract, Part XI of UNCLOS, the 1994 Agreement and the rules, regulations and procedures of the ISA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if TOML has failed to comply with a final binding decision of the dispute settlement body applicable to it; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if TOML becomes insolvent or commits an act of bankruptcy or enters into any agreement for composition with its creditors or goes into liquidation or receivership, whether compulsory or voluntary,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

31




● | or petitions or applies to any tribunal for the appointment of a receiver or a trustee or receiver for itself or commences any proceedings relating to itself under any bankruptcy, insolvency or readjustment of debt law, whether now or hereafter in effect, other than for the purpose of reconstruction.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, if the nationality or control of TOML changes or TOML’s Sponsoring State, as defined in the Regulations, terminates its sponsorship and TOML does not obtain another sponsor meeting the requirements prescribed in the Regulations, then the TOML Exploration Contract will terminate.
The TOML Sponsorship Agreement
On March 8, 2008, Tonga and TOML entered into the TOML Sponsorship Agreement formalizing certain obligations of the parties in relation to TOML’s exploration and potential exploitation of a proposed application to the ISA (subsequently granted) known as the TOML Area. Tonga updated the sponsorship agreement with TOML in September 2021. Unless otherwise terminated by the parties, the term for the TOML Sponsorship Agreement is for the duration of TOML’s ISA Exploration Contract and will automatically extend for a further 25 years upon TOML being granted an ISA Exploitation Contract. Upon reaching the minimum recovery level within the tenement area, TOML has agreed to pay Tonga a seabed mineral recovery payment based on the polymetallic nodules recovered from the tenement area. In addition, TOML will pay an administration fee each year to Tonga for such administration and sponsorship, which is subject to review and increase in the event that TOML is granted an ISA Exploitation Contract.
Under ISA requirements contractors are required to submit five-year work programs. The first TOML five-year work program was completed in 2016 and reviewed and accepted by the ISA in late 2016.
For the second five-year period ending in 2021, TOML proposed the following program: (i) continue environmental baseline work; (ii) complete pilot testing; (iii) complete geotechnical studies; (iv) complete feasibility studies; (v) first draft EIS/EMMP; and (vi) continue training. TOML noted that the program was dependent on success at each stage, subject to change based on findings at hand at any particular time and reliant on funding which in turn is dependent to some extent on macro-economic conditions and development with regards to the authority and its stakeholders.
As a result of the financial state of the previous owner of TOML, TOML did not progress at the rate intended until we purchased TOML in March 2020.
TOML plans to collaborate closely with NORI on the development of offshore technology and nodule processing solutions.
Marawa Agreements
On March 17, 2012, our wholly-owned subsidiary, DGE, entered into an Option Agreement (the “Option Agreement”) with Marawa and Kiribati. In consideration of the $250,000 option fee, Marawa granted DGE an option to purchase tenements, as may be granted to Marawa by the ISA or any other regulatory body, for $300,000, or in consideration of DGE waiving any loan and other debt obligation pursuant to the Services Agreement (as defined below) if a default event occurs. The exercise period for the option is a maximum of 40 years after the date of the execution of the Option Agreement.
On July 26, 2012, the ISA Council approved a plan of work for exploration submitted by Marawa covering the Marawa Contract Area. Marawa is in the process of preparing to submit its 5-year periodic review report to the ISA. Due to uncertainty on the economic potential of the Marawa Contract Area, Marawa is currently considering conducting another exploration campaign to increase the geological knowledge or is considering to seek a new area. Marawa expects to finalize its decision in 2022. Marawa has delayed its 2022 geological and environmental work programs until it determines how it will move forward.
On October 1, 2013, DGE entered into an agreement (the “Services Agreement”) with the Republic of Kiribati and Marawa granting DGE the exclusive right for 40 years to carry out exploration and collection in the Marawa Contract Area as well as purchase polymetallic nodules collected from the Marawa Contract Area. The Marawa Exploration Contract was signed on January 19, 2015. Mineral resource definition work began in 2020 for the Marawa Contract Area and we expect to continue undertaking such work in the near future.

32



DGE has the right to terminate the Services Agreement for convenience at any time at its election by giving written notice to Marawa and Kiribati and such termination shall take effect two months following the date of the termination notice, provided that DGE shall pay to the ISA on behalf of Marawa the fees or payments legally owed to the ISA by Marawa (including the Annual ISA Exploration Fee and ISA Royalties and Taxes) that are outstanding at the date of termination or that are incurred within 12 months of the date of such termination, provided that Marawa shall have an obligation to minimize such fees and payments to the extent practicable after the date of said termination. DGE and Marawa have considered the potential to amend the current contractual arrangements to provide additional mutual benefits in the conduct of operations, though no assurances may be given that any changes will be agreed.
Royalties and taxes
Royalties and taxes payable on any future production from the CCZ will be stipulated in the ISA’s exploitation regulations. While the rates of payments are yet to be set by the ISA, the 1994 Implementation Agreement (Section 8(1)(b)) prescribes that the rates of payments “shall be within the range of those prevailing in respect of land-based mining of the same or similar minerals in order to avoid giving deep seabed miners an artificial competitive advantage or imposing on them a competitive disadvantage.”
An ad hoc ISA working group has met several times including most recently in February 2020 to discuss a number of potential royalty and taxation regimes supported by modelling conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. No final recommendations were made. However, a 2% ad valorem royalty increasing to 6% after a period of five years of production was discussed as well as a 1% ad valorem environmental levy. These amounts were used for the economic analysis included in the initial assessment contained in the NORI Technical Report Summary. Additional discussions have considered capping any proposed environmental levy once an agreed total value has been reached and might no longer be collected once sufficient funds are in trust. We can provide no assurances that any such royalties or levies will not be greater than those discussed and could be significantly greater. The road map agreed to in December 2021, has allocated two days of discussion of the development and negotiation of the financial terms during the March 2022 Council session.
Under the NORI Sponsorship Agreement between Nauru and NORI and under the TOML Sponsorship Agreement between Tonga and TOML, upon reaching a minimum recovery level within the tenement areas, NORI and TOML have agreed to pay Nauru and Tonga a seabed mineral recovery payment for polymetallic nodules recovered from the tenement area, annually adjusted (from year 5 of production) on a compounding basis based on the official inflation rate in the United States. In addition, NORI and TOML will pay an administration fee each year to Nauru and Tonga for such administration and sponsorship, which is subject to review and increase in the event that NORI or TOML are granted an ISA Exploitation Contract.
Environmental Regulation
The ISA is mandated through UNCLOS to “preserve and protect the marine environment” while developing the resources within the Area. Given the location of the NORI Contract Area, the ISA is responsible for assessing any ESIA prepared by NORI and for granting the relevant permits.
Between 1998 and 2019, the ISA held workshops and developed a number of documents to provide guidance to contractors with respect to its expectations for responsible environmental management during the exploration and collection phases of mineral development. Regulations for exploration have been established, and environmental standards and guidelines (together with environmental provisions in the Draft Regulations for Exploitation) to apply to operations are currently under development. The ISA held a workshop “towards an ISA environmental management strategy for the Area” in March 2017 in Berlin, Germany. The results of the workshop were published as ISA technical Study 17 (ISA 2017).
The ISA has issued Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Nodules (adopted on July 13, 2000, updated on July 25, 2013). The regulations are complemented by the LTC’s recommendations for the guidance of contractors on assessing the environmental impacts of exploration. The exploitation regulations on deep-seabed collection will be complemented by various standards and guidelines. The ISA is currently developing these Standards and Guidelines which are expected to be finalized by the LTC and adopted by the Council. The ISA has divided the required standards and guidelines in three phases.

● | Phase 1: Standards and guidelines deemed necessary to be in place by the time of adoption of the draft regulations on exploitation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

33




● | Phase 2: Standards and guidelines deemed necessary to be in place prior to the receipt of an application of a plan of work for exploitation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3: Standards and guidelines deemed necessary to be in place before commercial mining activities commence in the Area.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Ten standards and guidelines have been prepared in Phase 1, provided to stakeholders for comment, reviewed and amended by the LTC and provided to Council for consideration and approval. Approximately, 20 additional standards and guidelines will be drafted as part of the development of Phase 2 in 2022 for stakeholder comment and review. Once the LTC has finalized the standards and guidelines, they will be provided to the Council for review and adoption.
Although the environmental impact review process has not yet been finalized, all contractors have been made aware that the ISA requires the completion of baseline studies and EIA, culminating in an EIS for proposed commercial operations, prior to collection. Guidance for contractors in terms of what will be expected in the EIS has been provided in ISA Technical Study No. 10 (ISA 2012a). The EIS, along with an EMMP, will be required as part of the application for an ISA Exploitation Contract for operations in the CCZ. Environmental impacts of exploration and potential collection activities have been studied, and NORI is working with several of the deep-sea research institutions that are contributing to our environmental and social impact assessment program, consisting of over 100 discrete studies.
NORI’s offshore exploration campaigns have included sampling to support environmental studies, collection of high-resolution imagery, full column physical and chemical oceanographic data and environmental baseline studies. All offshore campaigns to support environmental baseline data collection have been completed. A collector test involving trialing of collector vehicle and riser system is planned for 2022. A key objective of this test is to monitor the environmental impact of the collection system and use these data to forecast the impacts for a full-scale commercial operation. NORI intends to manage the project under the governance of an environmental management system (“EMS”), which is to be developed in accordance with the international EMS standard, ISO 14001:2004. The EMS will provide the overall framework for the environmental management and monitoring plans that will be required.
NORI’s EMMP will specify the objectives and purpose of all monitoring requirements, the components to be monitored, frequency of monitoring, methods of monitoring, analysis required in each monitoring component, monitoring data management and reporting. The EMMP will be submitted to the ISA as part of the ISA Exploitation Contract application.
Through a consultation process initiated by the ISA in 2013 and the feedback that was obtained from multiple stakeholder groups, the environmental permitting process is expected to involve a series of checks and balances with reviews being conducted by the LTC. The recommendations of the LTC will go before the ISA Council, which will then review and, if it deems appropriate, approve the exploitation application.
In addition, the sponsoring State has a responsibility to put in place legislation to ensure the entity it has sponsored complies with UNCLOS and ISA rules and regulations. Nauru implemented the Nauru International Seabed Minerals Act in 2015 which acts as a second layer of legislation with which NORI is required to comply.

To date, NORI’s assessment is that it is in compliance with existing exploration permits and contracts. NORI estimates that it is in the middle stages of the exploitation permitting process. In addition to working on key engineering aspects of the project such as designing the nodule collector and the dewatering facility, NORI is also continuing the following tasks:

● | delineating nodule mineralization;
--+-----------------------------------


● | characterizing the nature of the seabed, water column and biology;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | conducting environmental baseline studies and impact assessments;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | characterizing the nature of any materials returned to the environment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | developing oceanographic and physical information to inform models (e.g., sediment plume models); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | developing other plans, including the EMMP and the various subordinate plans.

The potential future onshore environmental impacts have not yet been assessed because the processing plant that we expect to create or use through a tolling or other arrangement has not been determined or otherwise has not been designed in sufficient detail, and the location and host country (and hence regulatory regime) has not been confirmed. The planned metallurgical process is expected to generate near-zero solid waste products, and the deleterious elements (for example, cadmium and arsenic) content of the nodules is understood to be very low, indicating that with careful management, the environmental impacts of the processing operation is expected to be low.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection of our core technology and intellectual property, as well as that of our strategic partners, and particularly that our freedom to operate is not restricted by patents lodged by competitors or other third parties. Moreover, we rely on a combination of trade secret protection, non-disclosure and licensing agreements and trademarks to establish and protect our proprietary intellectual property. To this end, we maintain a portfolio of issued patents and pending patent applications, which relate to offshore collection systems and to the processing of polymetallic nodules for recovering metals. As we rely on a number of patents to establish and protect our intellectual property, we have obtained and filed patent applications in countries throughout North America, Europe and Asia.
We cannot conclusively state that any pending applications, existing or future intellectual property will be definitively useful in protecting or promoting our business and growth plans. Please see the section entitled “Risk Factors” for additional information on the risks associated with our intellectual property strategy and portfolio.
COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the global outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. Since then, there have been actions, of varying severity, taken around the world to mitigate and manage the spread of COVID-19. The disparate actions undertaken by local governments to mitigate or manage the spread have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on supply chains and labor markets worldwide. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act to provide financial stimulus and support as a result of the initial economic fallout from events related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As we are a pre-revenue company, the impacts of COVID-19 are relatively smaller than companies with commercial operations. Depending on the duration and evolution of the pandemic and our supply chains and future customers’ ability to operate normally, there could be future challenges to our business which we cannot currently foresee. It is critical for our partners to have access to supplies and competent human capital for us to collectively meet our business objectives. As we have seen during the height of the pandemic and continuing regulations in certain countries, many of our contractors and service providers have modified their business practices to limit travel and in-person meetings.

While there are positive signs that the current situation is being managed well in most parts of the world and country-wide restrictions and lockdowns are subsiding, there can be no guarantee that any new COVID-19 variant would not result in reinstating restrictions which may impact our business. If significant portions of our contractors, service providers and partners are unable to work effectively, including due to illness, lockdowns, quarantine measures or other government actions, our current development activities and future operations may be impacted negatively. For instance, the final exploitation regulations were expected to be adopted by the ISA during 2020 but were delayed due to COVID-19.
Offshore, in 2021, we have safely and successfully completed five complex campaigns in our NORI Area D in the CCZ involving crew and scientists departing from and returning to San Diego from around the world. In close coordination with our partner, Maersk, we have implemented rigid quarantining and testing protocols designed to provide a safe COVID-19 free work environment. Onshore, our pilot plant program at third-party facilities has proceeded without COVID-19 related incidents. Our corporate and project development teams have adopted a virtual working environment without a traditional office setting. This means we have been minimally impacted by countrywide lockdowns across the globe. We continue to work and collaborate through virtual channels on an ongoing basis.
We continue to closely monitor the recent developments surrounding the continued spread and potential resurgence of COVID-19 from variants. The COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse impact on our operations, particularly because of preventive and precautionary measures that our company, other businesses, and governments are taking. Refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. We are unable to predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration of the pandemic and the actions that may be taken by government authorities. However, COVID-19 is not expected to result in any significant changes to our business or our costs in the near term. We will continue to monitor the performance of our business and reassess the impacts of COVID-19.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we employed thirty-one (31) employees and contractors. None of our staff are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Diversity and Inclusion. We are committed to attracting, developing and retaining diverse talent that is inclusive of every age, gender, gender identity, race, sexual orientation, physical capability, neurological difference, ethnicity, belief and perspective. Our goal is to develop cultural competency by seeking knowledge, increasing awareness, modeling respect and promoting inclusion. Geographically our staff are located in Tonga, Nauru, United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates. Our team is comprised of highly skilled individuals with 61% of our staff holding post-graduate degrees, including 19% who hold a Ph.D. degree. Moreover, 32% of our staff are women and 29% of our staff are racially diverse.
People Engagement. As a company working to pioneer a new industry and new ways of doing things, our success depends on attracting and retaining strong, independent, entrepreneurial, and multi-talented team members capable of dealing with high levels of uncertainty and adversity. Our team is distributed across several continents and several time zones, with remote working being the norm for most of our staff. Despite physical and temporal separation, we maintain a strong sense of cohesion by attracting people who are intrinsically motivated by the company’s purpose and core values, cultivating a flat organizational structure and deep care for each other. We rely on regular management and company meetings, ongoing communication flows across different technology platforms, frequent ad hoc video communication and creating opportunities for in-person gatherings. We offer our team members flexible work schedules and autonomy in managing their time while encouraging them to set boundaries between work on our shared mission and their home lives.
Compensation and Benefits. We compensate our staff competitively, striving to be in the 50th-60th percentile of our peers for total compensation and benefits. In addition to salaries, our compensation and benefits program includes annual discretionary bonuses, equity awards, an employee stock purchase plan, a 401(k) contribution/superannuation or RRSP benefit contribution (as applicable jurisdictionally), healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts. Our annual equity compensation is focused on company priorities that we believe create long-term value for our stakeholders.

Environment, Health & Safety (EHS). Our EHS vision is to fully integrate environmental, health and safety into our operations, and to create a workplace free of incidents. In 2021, we have relied on the EHS programs of our partners Allseas and until December 2021, Maersk. These all involve EHS systems incorporating thorough planning, risk assessment and disciplined implementation of controls as well as culturally-based safety observations systems like safe act observations and obligation of “stop work if it is unsafe to proceed”. In 2021, the five offshore exploration campaigns have been completed without any health and safety incident and no COVID-19 outbreaks. Since 2011, fifteen NORI campaigns have been completed without any lost-time injury. In addition, construction of the collector test system has involved 416,000 person-hours, without any lost-time injury.
