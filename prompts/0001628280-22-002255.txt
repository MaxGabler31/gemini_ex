ITEM 1    Business

Hubbell Incorporated (herein referred to as “Hubbell”, the “Company”, the “registrant”, “we”, “our” or “us”, which references shall include its divisions and subsidiaries as the context may require) was founded as a proprietorship in 1888, and was incorporated in Connecticut in 1905. Recognized for our innovation, quality, and deep commitment to serving our customers for over 130 years, Hubbell is a world-class manufacturer of electrical and utility solutions, with more than 75 brands used around the world. We provide utility and electrical solutions that enable our customers to operate critical infrastructure reliably and efficiently, and we empower and energize communities through innovative solutions supporting energy infrastructure In Front of the Meter, on The Edge, and Behind the Meter. In Front of the Meter is where utilities transmit and distribute energy to their customers. The Edge connects utilities with owner/operators and allows energy and data to be distributed back and forth. Behind the Meter is where owners and operators of building and other critical infrastructure consume energy. 
Our products are either sourced complete, manufactured or assembled by subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Mexico, the People’s Republic of China (“China”), the United Kingdom (“UK”), Brazil, Australia, Spain and Ireland. Hubbell also participates in joint ventures in Hong Kong and the Philippines, and maintains offices in Singapore, Italy, China, India, Mexico, South Korea, Chile, and countries in the Middle East.
The Company’s reporting segments consist of the Electrical Solutions segment and the Utility Solutions segment. 
The Company’s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available free of charge through the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at http://www.hubbell.com as soon as practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. The information contained on the Company’s website or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this report.
Electrical Solutions SegmentHubbell Electrical Solutions is positioned Behind the Meter, providing key components to building operators and industrial customers that enable them to manage their energy and operate critical infrastructure more efficiently and effectively. The Electrical Solutions segment (44% of consolidated revenues in 2021, 44% in 2020 and 45% in 2019) comprises businesses that sell stock and custom products including standard and special application wiring device products, rough-in electrical products, connector and grounding products, and lighting fixtures, as well as other electrical equipment. 
Products of the Electrical Solutions segment have applications in the light industrial, non-residential, wireless communications, transportation, data center, and heavy industrial markets. Electrical Solutions segment products are typically used in and around industrial, commercial and institutional facilities by electrical contractors, maintenance personnel, electricians, utilities, and telecommunications companies. In addition, certain of our businesses design and manufacture industrial controls and communication systems used in the non-residential and industrial markets. Many of these products are designed such that they can also be used in harsh and hazardous locations where a potential for fire and explosion exists due to the presence of flammable gasses and vapors. Harsh and hazardous products are primarily used in the oil and gas (onshore and offshore) and mining industries. We also offer a variety of lighting fixtures, wiring devices and electrical products that have residential and utility applications, including residential products with Internet-of-Things ("IoT") enabled technologies.
These products are sold under various brands and/or trademarks and are primarily sold through electrical and industrial distributors, home centers, retail and hardware outlets, lighting showrooms and residential product oriented internet sites. Special application products are primarily sold through wholesale distributors to contractors, industrial customers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). Brands and/or trademarks of products of the Electrical segment include:

Utility Solutions SegmentHubbell Utility Solutions has leading positions In Front of the Meter and at The Edge. The Utility Solutions segment (56% of consolidated revenues in 2021, 56% in 2020 and 55% in 2019) consists of businesses that design, manufacture, and sell a wide variety of electrical distribution, transmission, substation, and telecommunications products, which support applications In Front of the Meter. This includes utility transmission & distribution (T&D) components such as arresters, insulators, connectors, anchors, bushings, and enclosures. The Utility Solutions segment also offers solutions that serve The Edge of the utility infrastructure, including smart meters, communications systems, and protection and control devices. Hubbell Utility Solutions supports the electrical distribution, electrical transmission, water, gas distribution, telecommunications, and solar and wind markets. While Hubbell believes its sales in this area are not materially dependent upon any customer or group of customers, a substantial decrease in purchases by electrical utilities would affect this segment.

• | Aclara® | • | Chance® | • | Anderson® | • | PenCell® 
• | Fargo® | • | Hubbell® | • | Polycast® | • | Opti-loop Design®

Discontinued OperationsIn October 2021, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Commercial and Industrial Lighting business for a cash purchase price of $350 million, subject to customary adjustments with respect to working capital and net indebtedness. The Commercial and Industrial Lighting business designs, manufactures and sells LED lighting and control solutions for commercial and industrial customers. This business was previously included in the Electrical Solutions segment and is now presented as a discontinued operation in our Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented. On February 1, 2022 we completed the sale. See also Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis — “Executive Overview of the Business” and “Results of Operations”, as well as Note 2 — Discontinued Operations, and Note 21 — Industry Segments and Geographic Area Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Organizational ChangesEffective January 1, 2021 the Company consolidated the three business groups within its Electrical segment, and renamed the segment as Hubbell Electrical Solutions ("Electrical Solutions"). The Electrical Solutions segment unites businesses with similar operating models, products, and go to market strategies under one operating banner and common leadership to drive synergies and long-term growth opportunities. 
Also effective January 1, 2021 the Company moved its Hubbell Gas Connectors and Accessories business, from the Electrical Solutions segment to the Utility Solutions segment to create synergies with the existing gas products already offered within the Utility Solutions segment and to better serve its utility customers. The Hubbell Gas Connectors and Accessories business represented approximately $157.1 million of Net sales and $19.4 million of operating profit in 2020. The information provided in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes reflects the impact of this change for all periods presented.

Information Applicable to Our BusinessInternational Operations

The Company has several operations located outside of the United States. These operations manufacture, assemble and/or procure and market Hubbell products and services for both the Electrical Solutions and Utility Solutions segments.

See Note 21 — Industry Segments and Geographic Area Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors relating to manufacturing in and sourcing from foreign countries.
Customers
We have an extensive customer base of distributors, wholesalers, electric utilities, OEMs, electrical contractors, telecommunications companies and retail and hardware outlets. We are not dependent on a single customer, however, our top ten customers account for approximately 42% of our Net sales. 
Raw Materials
Raw materials used in the manufacture of Hubbell products primarily include steel, aluminum, brass, copper, bronze, zinc, nickel, plastics, phenolics, elastomers and petrochemicals. Hubbell also purchases certain electrical and electronic components, including solenoids, lighting ballasts, printed circuit boards, integrated circuit chips and cord sets, from a number of suppliers. Hubbell is not materially dependent upon any one supplier for raw materials used in the manufacture of its products and equipment however the cost and supply of these materials may be affected by disruptions in availability of raw materials, components or sourced finished goods. See also Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
Patents

Hubbell has approximately 3,000 active United States and foreign patents covering a portion of its products, which expire at various times. While Hubbell deems these patents to be of value, it does not consider its business to be dependent upon patent protection. Hubbell also licenses products under patents owned by others, as necessary, and grants licenses under certain of its patents. 
Working Capital

Inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable levels, payment terms and, where applicable, return policies are in accordance with the general practices of the electrical products industry and standard business procedures. See also Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
Backlog

Substantially all of the backlog existing at December 31, 2021 in the Electrical Solutions segment is expected to be shipped to customers in 2022. In the Utility Solutions segment, the backlog existing at December 31, 2021 includes backlog expected to be shipped during 2022, along with $420 million of backlog of contracts that span multiple years, primarily related to long-term contracts of the Aclara business to deliver and install meters and grid monitoring sensor technology. The backlog of orders believed to be firm at December 31, 2021 was $1,848.0 million compared to $1,065.8 million at December 31, 2020. Although this backlog is important, the majority of Hubbell’s revenues result from sales of inventoried products or products that have short periods of manufacture. 
Competition

Hubbell experiences substantial competition in all categories of its business, but does not compete with the same companies in all of its product categories. The number and size of competitors vary considerably depending on the product line. Hubbell cannot specify with precision the number of competitors in each product category or their relative market position. However, some of its competitors are larger companies with substantial financial and other resources. Hubbell considers product performance, reliability, quality and technological innovation as important factors relevant to all areas of its business and considers its reputation as a manufacturer of quality products to be an important factor in its business. In addition, product price, service levels and other factors can affect Hubbell’s ability to compete.

Environment

The Company is subject to various federal, state and local government requirements relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment. The Company believes that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury to its employees and its customers’ employees and that the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations.

Like other companies engaged in similar businesses, the Company has incurred or acquired through business combinations, remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination, and is a party to product liability and other lawsuits and claims associated with environmental matters, including past production of products containing toxic substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. However, considering past experience and reserves, the Company does not anticipate that these matters will have a material adverse effect on earnings, capital expenditures, financial condition or competitive position. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 16 — Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Human Capital 
Our commitment to developing our employees is one of four pillars that guide Hubbell as a company. We recruit, hire, and develop talent that meets and anticipates the ever-changing needs of our enterprise, while fostering an inclusive and diverse workplace. Hubbell provides market competitive compensation, health and well-being programs, and retirement benefits based on the countries and markets in which we operate to motivate market-leading performance. 
As of December 31, 2021, Hubbell had approximately 18,300 salaried and hourly employees of whom approximately 10,400, or 57%, are located in the United States. Approximately 2,400 of these U.S. employees are represented by 8 labor unions. Hubbell considers its labor relations to be satisfactory and regularly engages with its labor unions.
Hubbell is committed to fostering an environment that respects and encourages individual differences, diversity of thought, and talent. We strive to create a workplace where employees feel that their contributions are welcomed and valued, allowing them to fully engage their talents and training in their work, while generating personal satisfaction in their role within Hubbell. Hubbell has created a multi-year, enterprise-wide strategy dedicated to evolving our inclusive culture while addressing underrepresentation where it exists across our company. As of December 31, 2021, 32% of our employees identify as female, and within the United States, 29% identify as female and 44% are racially diverse. Hubbell has also joined the Paradigm for Parity coalition, with over 100 companies in committing to achieve gender parity in its senior leadership by 2030.
Across, the enterprise, there are a variety of ways we invest in our people to learn - on the job, in the classroom, through self-directed learning, or through leadership programs. We have expanded our learning management system (known as Hubbell University) to make new content and training available to our employees. The Company has also expanded leadership development programs and continues to expand internship programs to continue to develop new talent.
The Company also fosters and encourages its employees to give back to their communities. In 2020, Hubbell launched its inaugural Hubbell Helping Hands dedicated month of service, making October an annual month of volunteerism focus for the Company. The Company also supports employees’ spirit of volunteerism in their communities throughout the year with its Volunteer Paid Time Off policy, which provides all employees with up to 8 hours of paid time off a year to volunteer with an eligible 501(c)(3) charity of their choice.
As a manufacturing company we focus on protecting the health and safety of our employees. We dedicate resources to track and monitor safety and recordable incidents using an enterprise-wide data management system. As a result, the total recordable incident rate has decreased 22% over the last 5 years and the days away restricted rate has decreased 1% over the last 5 years. 
In 2021, Hubbell’s top priority has continued to be ensuring that we take appropriate actions to protect the health and safety of our employees, including managing the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have adjusted standard operating procedures within our business operations to ensure the continued safety of those within our locations and we continually monitored evolving health guidelines to ensure ongoing compliance and protection of our employees. These procedures include expanded and more frequent cleaning within facilities, implementation of appropriate social distancing programs, shift changes, requiring use of certain personal protective equipment, screening protocols and a hybrid approach to working from home and in the office. The Company provides paid time off for employees to get vaccination shots and has continued to manage a flexible attendance program to support employees managing periods of quarantine or that need to be out of work pending test results.
In July 2021, as a showing of appreciation for the employees’ efforts to serve the Company’s customers through the pandemic, the Company provided all employees globally with a Global Recharge Day. This paid day off provided all employees an opportunity to relax, refresh and recharge.

In addition to the foregoing, the Company also invested in various programs to support employees' mental and physical health during the pandemic. The Company has also expanded the delivery of mental health and wellness resources, including by increasing the frequency of live engagement events and partnering with providers to make mental health counseling and overall wellness tools accessible to employees globally. 
We will continue to evolve these programs to protect the health, well-being and safety of our employees.
