ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General
 
Saker Aviation Services, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”) is a Nevada corporation. Our common stock, $0.03 par value per share (the “common stock”), is quoted on the OTCQB Marketplace (“OTCQB”) under the symbol “SKAS”. Through our subsidiaries, we operate in the aviation services segment of the general aviation industry, in which we serve as the operator of a heliport, a fixed base operation (“FBO”), a provider of aircraft maintenance and repair services (“MRO”), and as a consultant for a seaplane base that we do not own. FBOs provide ground-based services, such as fueling and aircraft storage for general aviation, commercial and military aircraft, and other miscellaneous services.
 
We were formed on January 17, 2003 as a proprietorship and were incorporated in Arizona on January 2, 2004. We became a public company as a result of a reverse merger transaction on August 20, 2004 with Shadows Bend Development, Inc., an inactive public Nevada corporation, and subsequently changed our name to FBO Air, Inc. On December 12, 2006, we changed our name to FirstFlight, Inc. On September 2, 2009, we changed our name to Saker Aviation Services, Inc.
 
Our business activities are carried out as the operator of the Downtown Manhattan (New York) Heliport, and as an FBO and MRO at the Garden City (Kansas) Regional Airport.
 
The Garden City facility became part of our company as a result of our acquisition of the FBO assets of Central Plains Aviation, Inc. in March 2005 and of Aircraft Services, Inc. (“Aircraft Services”) in October 2016.
 
Our business activities at the Downtown Manhattan (New York) Heliport facility (the “Heliport”) commenced in November 2008 when we were awarded the Concession Agreement by the City of New York to operate the Heliport, which we assigned to our subsidiary, FirstFlight Heliports, LLC d/b/a Saker Aviation Services (“FFH”).
 
We believe the general aviation market has been historically cyclical, with revenue correlated to general U.S. economic conditions. Although not truly seasonal in nature, the spring and summer months tend to generate higher levels of revenue and our operations generally follow that trend. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to a decline in travel and tourism related businesses and general economic conditions in the United States and significantly disrupted our business and operations in the year ended December 31, 2021, as well as disrupted business operations in the United States and globally. To the extent local, regional and the federal government impose restrictions on air travel and/or air tourism or consumers cease traveling, our results of operations will continue to be negatively impacted. We cannot predict with certainty the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, which will largely depend on the length and severity of the ongoing pandemic and any recovery will depend on consumer willingness to travel by air. Please see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” below.
 
Concession Agreement for New York Heliport
 
We are a party to a Concession Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2008, with the City of New York for the operation of the Downtown Manhattan Heliport (the “Concession Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Concession Agreement, we must pay the greater of 18% of the first $5,000,000 in any program year based on cash collected (“Gross Receipts”) and 25% of Gross Receipts in excess of $5,000,000, or minimum annual guaranteed payments.
 
We and the New York City Economic Development Corporation (the “NYCEDC”) announced new measures to reduce helicopter noise and impacts across New York City (the “Air Tour Agreement”). Under the Air Tour Agreement, we have not been allowed to permit our tenant operators to conduct tourist flights from the Downtown Manhattan Heliport on Sundays since April 1, 2016. We are also required to ensure that its tenant operators reduce the total allowable number of tourist flights from 2015 levels by 20 percent beginning June 1, 2016, by 40 percent beginning October 1, 2016 and by 50 percent beginning January 1, 2017. The Air Tour Agreement also provided for the minimum annual guarantee payments we are required to pay to the City of New York under the Concession Agreement be reduced by 50%, effective January 1, 2017. Additionally, since June 1, 2016, we have been required to provide monthly written reports to the NYCEDC and the New York City Council detailing the number of tourist flights conducted out of the Downtown Manhattan Heliport compared to 2015 levels, as well as information on any tour flight that flies over land and/or strays from agreed upon routes. The Air Tour Agreement also extended the Concession Agreement for 30 months, resulting in a new expiration date of April 30, 2021 and gave the City of New York two one-year options to extend the term of the Concession Agreement. The term of the Concession Agreement was subsequently extended by the City of New York through April 30, 2023 by the city’s exercise of both its two one-year option renewals.

Lease for Garden City (Kansas) Regional Airport
 
We lease facilities from Garden City, Kansas, which allows us to operate the Garden City Regional Airport and provide for: (a) a 21-year lease term expiring December 31, 2030, with one five-year renewal period, and (b) a base rent of $2,187 per month. In addition, we incur a fuel flowage fee of $0.06 per gallon of fuel received. The fuel flowage fee is to be reviewed annually by the Garden City Regional Airport, the City of Garden, and us. Flowage fees on fuel gallons purchased aggregated approximately $43,000 and $36,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 
We lease additional facilities from Garden City, Kansas, which provides for a 14 year lease term expiring December 31, 2030 with a base rent of $565 a month.
 
Suppliers and Raw Materials
 
Our principal materials are aviation fuel and aircraft parts. We obtain aviation fuel, component parts and other supplies from a variety of sources, generally from more than one supplier. Our suppliers and sources are both domestic and foreign, and we believe that our sources of materials are adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. We do not believe the loss of any one supplier would have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We generally purchase our supplies on the open market, where certain commodities have fluctuated in price significantly in recent years. We have not experienced any significant shortage of our key supplies.
Marketing and Sales
 
The main goal of our marketing and sales efforts is to increase traffic at our facilities, which we believe would then drive revenue through the incremental sale of our products and services. Our primary marketing tactic in this regard is to focus advertising efforts in the environments (web, periodical and industry publications) where the pilot and aviation-user community might be introduced to our brand name and locations. We intend to continue to invest in improvements to our sales and marketing strategies to drive revenue growth.
Government Approvals 
 
The aviation services that we provide are generally performed on municipal or other government owned real estate properties. Accordingly, at times we will need to obtain certain consents or approvals from governmental entities in conjunction with our operations. These consents and approvals are typically in the form of a lease agreement, as is the case at our Kansas facility, or a concession agreement, as is the case with our New York facility. There can be no assurance that we will obtain further consents or approvals on favorable terms or be able to renew existing consents or approvals on favorable terms, if at all.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations that apply to companies in the aviation industry. These include, among other matters, compliance with the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) rules and regulations, and local, regional and national rules and regulations as they relate to environmental matters. The FAA, from time to time, issues directives and other regulations relating to the management, maintenance and operation of facilities, including the potential of emergency regulations related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we may be subject to government procurement regulations as they relate to obtaining new agreements or renewing or extending existing agreements with governmental entities. Compliance with those requirements may cause us to incur significant expenditures. The proposal and enactment of additional laws and regulations, as well as any charges that we have not complied with any such laws and regulations, could significantly increase the cost of our operations and reduce overall revenue. We believe we are in compliance with, and intend to continue to comply with, all applicable government regulations but cannot provide assurance that compliance with existing laws and regulations or that laws or regulations enacted in the future will not adversely affect our business and results of operations. The adoption of new regulations could result in increased costs and have an adverse impact on our results of operations, including, for example, regulations that restricted air travel such as reduced seating capacity or possible temporary orders to cease operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Customers
 
In 2019, the Company’s accounts receivable was comprised of four customers at our New York Heliport. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, two of these customers were unable to sustain their business and ceased operating in 2020. Their receivable balances at December 31, 2020, totaling approximately $208,000, have been deemed uncollectable by the Company. The loss of these two customers has adversely affected our business and results of operations. The Company’s other two customers continue to operate, but at substantially reduced levels of operation. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, these remaining two customers represented approximately $180,000, or 58.9% of the balance of accounts receivable and 27.6% of the Company’s 2021 revenue. The Company has a security deposit in place in connection with both of these receivables. In March 2022, one of the Company’s former customers resumed operations. The Company has a security deposit in place with this customer.
 
Competition
 
The FBO segment of the aviation services industry is competitive in both pricing and service because aircraft in transit are able to choose from a number of FBO options within a 300-mile radius. The vast majority of FBO operators are independent, single location operators. We are the sole FBO at our facility in Garden City, KS. As such, we face no direct on-airport competition. However, we face competitive pressure on pricing and services from FBO facilities at other airports, depending on aircraft travel flexibility.
Costs and Effects of Complying With Environmental Laws
 
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those that govern health and safety requirements, the discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the responsibility to investigate and clean up contaminated sites that are or were owned, leased, operated or used by us or our predecessors. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain permits, which contain terms and conditions that impose limitations on our ability to emit and discharge hazardous materials into the environment and may be periodically subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. Fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and the failure to have or to comply with the terms and conditions of required permits. We intend to comply with these laws and regulations. However, from time to time, our operations may not be in full compliance with the terms and conditions of our permits or licenses. We periodically review our procedures and policies for compliance with environmental laws and requirements. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and requirements and that any potential non-compliance would not be expected to result in us incurring material liability or cost to achieve compliance. Although the cost of achieving and maintaining compliance with environmental laws and requirements has not been material, we can provide no assurance that such cost will not become material in the future.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 25 persons, 21 of which were employed on a full-time basis and 1 of which was an executive officer. All of our personnel are employed in connection with our operations in New York and Kansas.
