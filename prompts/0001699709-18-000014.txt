As of today, we have identified three customers to purchase our products. We are a newly created company which has just entered the market for selling workwear. On the current stage of our operations our main purpose is to get known among potential customers and profitably sell our workwear. We have decided that the best instrument to do this is though word of mouth marketing, which means to receive the best possible feedback from our existing customers, who we hope will recommend us to others.

Based on our current position the decision was made to maintain good quality of the products and reasonable prices for our initial customers. The management believes that this instrument will be very powerful and has great impact on our future sales, customers attractability and positive feedbacks. We believe that above mentioned summary of information will work towards our company future successes. 

We intend to focus on direct marketing efforts whereby our representative will directly contact:
 1.
 Distributors that are responsible for marketing and selling work wear;
 2.
 Construction companies;
 3.
 Retail outlets such as home restoration stores.

Competition

The level of competition in work wear distribution business is extremely high. Many of our established competitors have developed a brand following which would make our potential customers prefer their work wear to ours. Aggressive lower pricing tactics implemented by our competitors would make it difficult for us to enter the market. Economies of scale would make it easier for our larger established competitors to negotiate price discounts with their suppliers of work wear, which would leave us at a disadvantage. The principal competitive factors in our industry are pricing and quality of goods. We will be in a market where we compete with many domestic and international companies offering similar products. We will be in direct competition with them. Many large companies will be able to provide more favorable services to the potential customers. Many of these companies may have a greater, more established customer base than us. We will likely lose business to such companies. Also, many of these companies will be able to afford to offer better price for similar product than us, which may also cause us to lose business. We foresee to continue to face challenges from new market entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Sales Distribution Agreement and equipment purchase agreement with our suppliers

We have recently started our operation. As of today, we have developed our business plan, and Sales Distribution Agreement with our supplier, Miliu Wear Garment Co., Ltd. dated February 17, 2017 and equipment purchase agreement with Yiw Hon Impt & Exprt Co., Ltd. dated February 1, 2017.

Marketing

Our marketing campaign consists of several stages. First of all we will start out from direct marketing, such as offering our product at fairs and exhibitions, which will provide up-close demonstration of the high-quality and affordability of our work wear goods. We will also set up direct meeting with clients, which we believe will help us to develop customers database. Launch of our e-commerce ready web site, banners on popular websites and advertisements in social networks will be the second step of our campaign. In addition, we will send our advertisements to restaurants, hotels and related companies, small manufacturers of clothing, which can raise customer awareness and attract new partners. We are ready to offer a reasonable discount for long-term cooperation. In our future perspective is to contact marketing agency to help us market our products. 

We believe this marketing campaign will attract many customers and will help us develop a strong reputation of quality, diligent and inexpensive work wear products. Hopefully, our clients will readily recommend us to others.

Insurance

We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.
Employees

We are a development stage company and currently have no employees, other than our officers Aurora Fiorin and Antonio Bini.

Offices

Our business office is located at 4 Via Busco, Spresiano 31027 Italy. We have leased this office space for two years with monthly fees of $290. Our telephone number is 3904221500163. On September 28, 2017 the Company has entered into additional rental agreement for a $590 monthly fee, starting on November 1, 2017.
Government Regulation

We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to export and import of work wear and operation of any facility in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business. We do not need to receive any government approvals necessary to conduct our business; however we will have to comply with all applicable export and import regulations.
