Overview
Repligen Corporation is a global life sciences company that develops and commercializes highly innovative bioprocessing technologies and systems that increase efficiencies and flexibility in the process of manufacturing biological drugs.
 As the overall market for biologics continues to grow and expand, our primary customers – global biopharmaceutical companies and contract development and manufacturing organizations – face critical production cost, capacity, quality and time pressures. Built to address these concerns, our products help set new standards for the way biologics are manufactured. We are committed to inspiring advances in bioprocessing as a trusted partner in the production of critical biologic drugs – including monoclonal antibodies (“mAbs”), recombinant proteins, vaccines and cell and gene therapies (“C&GT”) – that are improving human health worldwide.
We currently operate as one bioprocessing business, with a comprehensive suite of products to serve both upstream and downstream processes in biological drug manufacturing. Building on over 40 years of industry expertise, we have developed a broad and diversified product portfolio that reflects our passion for innovation and the customer-first culture that drives our entire organization. We continue to capitalize on opportunities to maximize the value of our product platform through both organic growth initiatives (internal innovation and commercial leverage) and targeted acquisitions.
Our corporate headquarters are located in Waltham, Massachusetts, with additional administrative and manufacturing operations worldwide. The majority of our 16 key manufacturing sites are located in the United States (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York). Outside the United States, we have sites in Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden.
COVID-19 Considerations and Responses
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak, including all ensuing variants thereto, to be a pandemic (“COVID-19”). COVID-19 has resulted in government authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures such as travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, factory shutdowns and vaccine mandates. During 2021 and 2020, our revenues were positively affected by COVID-19. However, the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to affect our future financial results and operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the recurrence, severity and/or duration of COVID-19, and current or future domestic and international actions to contain and treat COVID-19.
With the health and safety of our employees as a top priority, we promptly created a COVID-19 task force in March 2020 focused on the Company’s response to COVID-19, which quickly established on-site COVID-19 testing, on-site restrictions and protocols, employee communications, vaccine awareness and education and remote workforce management; in addition, many of our employees continued working remotely for extended periods of time during 2021 and 2020. We are following public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the promotion of social distancing and continuing our work-from-home arrangements. We are taking a variety of measures to ensure the availability and functioning of our critical infrastructure, to promote the safety and security of our employees and to support the communities in which we operate. These measures include increasing our inventory, requiring remote working arrangements for employees who are not integral to physically making and shipping our products or who do not need specialized equipment to perform their work, restricting on-site visits by non-employees and investing in personal protective equipment. During 2021 and 2020, on-site testing was conducted

at all U.S. sites and offered as an option at sites outside the United States. Daily temperature screenings were available at most U.S. and non-U.S. sites and all employees were encouraged to receive the COVID-19 vaccinations and COVID-19 booster shots as they became available. As COVID-19 conditions improved, we began implementing a phased reopening process which we have since reversed in response to the identification of COVID-19 variants. We will continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees until COVID-19 is contained. We may take further actions and adjust our reopening process as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers.
For further discussion of the risks relating to COVID-19, see “The COVID-19 pandemic, or similar public health crises, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our product sales, and our stock price” in Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” below.
Our Products
Our bioprocessing business is comprised of four main franchises: filtration; chromatography; process analytics; and proteins.
Since 2012, we have purposely built a highly diversified portfolio of products offered under these franchises, developing technological solutions that enable more efficient drug manufacturing processes for our customers, through internal research and development (“R&D”) and strategic acquisitions. We are committed to sustainable innovation and have introduced disruptive new products in response to our customers’ bioprocessing challenges. Our growth strategy continues to expand our geographic scope, our customer base and applications of our technologies.
To support our sales growth goals for these products, we make ongoing investments in our commercial organization, our R&D team and our manufacturing capacity. We regularly evaluate and invest in these areas as needed to ensure timely deliveries and to stay ahead of increased customer demand for our products.
A majority of our revenue is derived from consumable and/or single-campaign (“single-use”) product sales, as compared to associated equipment. The customization, scalability and plug-and-play convenience of these products, and in many cases the closed nature of our technologies, make them ideal for use in biologics manufacturing processes where contamination risk is a critical concern of our customers.
Filtration
Filtration is our largest franchise with the broadest product offering covering upstream and downstream technologies. Below is a description of some of our key products:
 XCell ATF® Cell Retention Systems
Our filtration products offer a number of advantages to manufacturers of biologic drugs and are used in process development and process scale (clinical and commercial) production. Our XCell Alternating Tangential Flow (“ATF”) systems are used in upstream perfusion (continuous) and N-1 (intensified fed-batch or hybrid perfusion) cell culture processing.
 XCell ATF is a cell retention technology. The system is comprised of an advanced hollow fiber (“HF”) filtration device, a low shear pump and a controller. The XCell ATF system is connected to a bioreactor and enables the cell culture to be run continuously, with cells being retained in the bioreactor, fresh nutrients (cell culture media) being fed into the reactor continuously and clarified biological product and cell waste being removed (harvested) continuously. The cells are maintained in a consistent nutrient-rich environment and can reach cell densities two- and three-times higher than those achieved by standard fed-batch culture. As a result, product yield is increased, which improves facility utilization and can reduce the size of a bioreactor required to manufacture a given volume of biologic drug product. XCell ATF systems are available in a wide range of sizes that can easily scale from laboratory use through full production with bioreactors as large as 5,000 liters.
Through internal innovation, we developed and launched single-use formats of the original stainless steel XCell ATF devices to address increasing industry demand for single-use sterile systems with “plug-and-play” technology. The XCell ATF device is now available to customers in both its original configuration (steel housing and single-use filters) in all sizes (2, 4, 6 and 10), and/or as a single-use device (disposable housing/filter combination) in most sizes (2, 6, and 10). The availability of XCell ATF technology in a

single-use format reduces implementation time by eliminating the time intensive workflow associated with autoclaving and enables our customers to accelerate evaluations of the product with a lower initial overall cost of ownership.
TangenX® Flat Sheet Cassettes
Our TangenX product line (“TangenX”) balances our upstream XCell ATF systems (HF) with a portfolio of flat-sheet tangential flow filtration (“TFF”) cassettes used in downstream biologic drug concentration and formulation processes. The TangenX product portfolio includes our single-use SIUS® brand, providing customers with a high-performance, cost saving alternative to reusable TFF cassettes.
TFF is a rapid and efficient method for the concentration and formulation of biomolecules that is widely used in many applications in biopharmaceutical development and manufacturing. SIUS cassettes feature a high performing membrane and unique cartridge construction that enables a lower price point. Each disposable cassette is delivered pre-sanitized and ready to be equilibrated and used for tangential flow, ultrafiltration and diafiltration applications. Use of SIUS TFF cassettes eliminates non-value-added steps (cleaning, testing between uses, storage and flushing) that are required with reusable TFF products, providing cost and time savings. The cassettes are interchangeable with filter hardware from multiple manufacturers, simplifying customer trial and adoption of SIUS products.
In 2020, we introduced SIUS Gamma, which we engineered to harness the performance and efficiencies of TangenX® SIUS® membranes and cassettes, while also providing the convenience of a fully assembled, closed and irradiated system. The device is delivered as a package including the cassette, manifold, clamps, tubing and connectors. The customizable SIUS Gamma device is ideal for adenovirus cell and gene therapy ("C&GT") processes where large volumes need to be concentrated prior to chromatography.
 Spectrum® Hollow Fibers
Our filtration business is strengthened by a leading portfolio of Spectrum HF filtration solutions, including fully integrated KrosFlo® TFF® systems with Konduit sensing and ProConnex® Flow Path single-use assemblies. The KrosFlo family of TFF systems for product concentration is fully scalable from 2 milliliters to 5,000 liters – from lab-scale to commercial manufacturing. Designed for purification and formulation applications, KrosFlo systems enable robust downstream ultrafiltration and microfiltration.
We also gained the Spectra/Por® portfolio of laboratory and process dialysis products and in 2019, we launched the SpectraFlo Dynamic Dialysis Systems. Also, in 2019 we introduced the KrosFlo® TFDF® (Tangential Flow Depth Filtration) systems, which we believe have the potential to disrupt and displace traditional harvest clarification operations. The KrosFlo TFDF system includes control hardware, novel high throughput tubular depth filters and ProConnex® TFDF® flow paths. When used for cell culture clarification, single-use KrosFlo TFDF technology delivers unprecedented high flux (>1,000 LMH), high capacity, low turbidity, and minimal dilution, making the technology a high-performance alternative to traditional centrifugation and depth filtration approaches to harvest clarification. TFDF technology also provides benefits such as low hold-up volume, high recovery, small footprint, simple set up and disposal, scalability and reduced process time.
The Spectrum product line of HF filters is used in bench-tops through commercial-scale processes, primarily for the filtration, purification and concentration of biologics and diagnostic products. Our KrosFlo filtration systems and equipment offer both standard and customized solutions to bioprocessing customers, with particular strength in consumable and single-use offerings.
With our acquisition of Polymem S.A. (“Polymem”) on July 1, 2021, we further expanded our HF membrane and module production capabilities and added core R&D, engineering and production expertise in HF technology for both industrial and bioprocessing markets. The Polymem business complements our Spectrum HF product line, which includes KrosFlo TFF systems and ProConnex fluid management. The acquisition of Polymem accelerates our HF manufacturing buildout and adds a Europe-based HF manufacturing center of excellence.
 The growth of our filtration business has allowed us to substantially increase our direct sales presence in Europe and Asia and diversify our end markets to include all biologic classes, including mAb, vaccines, recombinant proteins and C&GT.


Other Filtration
 Over time, we have broadened the application of our Konduit monitor, which automates concentration and buffer exchange, to include use with both HF TFF systems. We also self-manufacture HF filters that are used in our XCell ATF, KrosFlo TFF and KrosFlo TFDF systems.
 With our acquisition of Engineered Molding Technology LLC (“EMT”) on July 13, 2020, we added EMT’s silicone-based, single-use components and manifolds to our filtration franchise. These fluid management products are key components in single-use filtration and chromatography systems and will help expand our line of single-use ProConnex flow paths, streamline our supply chain for ATF and provide more flexibility as we scale and expand our single-use and systems portfolios.
 With our acquisition of Non-Metallic Solutions, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation ("NMS") on October 20, 2020, we expanded our line of single-use systems and associated integrated flow path assemblies, streamlining our supply chain for current products, and giving us more flexibility to scale and expand single-use and systems portfolios.
 With our acquisition of the ARTeSYN Biosolutions Holdings Ireland Limited (“ARTeSYN”) business on December 3, 2020, we expanded our filtration offering, and added additional single-use components and flow path assemblies for fluid management, providing greater flexibility and market opportunity as we scale and expand our systems portfolio.
With our acquisition of BioFlex Solutions LLC (“BioFlex”) and Newton T&M Corp. (“NTM”) on December 16, 2021, we complemented and expanded our filtration franchise, as both BioFlex and NTM focus on single-use fluid management components, including single-use clamps, adapters, end caps and hose assemblies. These products are essential components in our upstream and downstream product offerings – especially our systems with line-sets and flow paths. These acquisitions streamline and increase our control over many components in our single-use supply chain, which ultimately should drive reduced lead-times for our customers in the coming years.
 Chromatography
Our chromatography franchise includes a number of products used in downstream purification, development, manufacturing and quality control of biological drugs. The main driver of growth in this portfolio is our OPUS® pre-packed column (“PPC”) product line.
 In addition to OPUS, with our acquisition of ARTeSYN in 2020, we added chromatography systems to our offerings, as well as single-use components and flow path assemblies for fluid management, providing greater flexibility and market opportunity as we scale and expand our systems portfolio.
 Additional chromatography products include our affinity capture resins, such as CaptivA® Protein A resins, that are used in a small number of commercial drug processes and our ELISA test kits, used by quality control departments to detect and measure the presence of leached Protein A and/or growth factor in the final product.
 OPUS Pre-Packed Columns
 Our chromatography franchise features a wide range of OPUS columns, which we deliver to our customers sealed and pre-packed with their choice of resin. These are single-use or campaign-use disposable columns that replace the use of customer-packed glass columns for downstream purification. By designing OPUS columns to be a technologically advanced and flexible option for the purification of biologics from process development through clinical and commercial-scale manufacturing, Repligen has become a leader in the PPC market. Our biomanufacturing customers value the significant cost savings that OPUS columns can deliver by reducing set up time, labor, equipment and facility costs – in addition to delivering product consistency and “plug-and-play” convenience.
We launched our first production scale OPUS columns in 2012 and have since added larger diameter options that scale up to use with 2,000 liter bioreactors. Our OPUS 80R column is the largest available PPC on the market for use in late-stage clinical or commercial purification processes. We offer unique features such as a resin recovery port on our larger columns, which allows our customers to remove and reuse the recovered resin in other applications. We believe the OPUS 5-80R product line is the most flexible product line

available in the market, serving the purification needs of customers manufacturing mAbs and other biologics such as vaccines and C&GT.
In addition to our larger scale OPUS columns, our portfolio includes our smaller-scale OPUS columns, including our RoboColumn®, MiniChrom® and ValiChrom® columns used for process development (“PD”) and validation. These columns are used in high-throughput PD screening, viral clearance validation studies and scale down validation of chromatography processes.
We maintain customer-facing centers in both the United States and Europe for our OPUS column customers, and offer a premier ability to pack any of hundreds of chromatography capture resins available, as per our customers’ choice.
Process Analytics
 Our process analytics products complement and support our filtration, chromatography and proteins franchises as they allow end-users to make at-line or in-line absorbance measurements allowing for the determination of protein concentration in filtration, chromatography formulation and fill-finish applications.
 SoloVPE® Device
 Our SoloVPE slope spectroscopy system is the industry standard for offline and at-line absorbance measurements for protein concentration determination in process development, manufacturing and quality control settings.
FlowVPE® Device
 Our FlowVPE slope spectroscopy system enhances the power of slope spectroscopy and provides in-line protein concentration measurement for filtration, chromatography and fill-finish applications. A key benefit of this in-line solution is the ability to monitor a manufacturing process in real time.
FlowVPX® System
 FlowVPX® slope spectroscopy system is our next-generation FlowVPE launched at the beginning of 2021 and designed to meet the rigors of regulatory GMP requirements. FlowVPX offers reliable real-time results with integrated ease for concentration measurements during every stage of the downstream GMP-compliant production-scale biologics manufacturing.
 Use of slope spectroscopy systems delivers multiple process benefits for our biopharmaceutical manufacturing customers, compared to traditional UV-Vis approaches. Key benefits include: the elimination of manual dilutions and sample transfers from process development/manufacturing to labs, rapid time to results (minutes versus hours), improved precision, built-in data quality for improved reporting and validation, and ease of use.
 Proteins
Our proteins franchise is represented by our Protein A affinity ligands, which are a critical component of Protein A chromatography resins used in downstream purification of virtually all mAb-based drugs on the market or in development, and cell culture growth factor products, which are a key component of cell culture media used in upstream bioprocessing to increase cell density and improve product yield.
Affinity Ligands
We are a leading provider of Protein A affinity ligands to life sciences companies. Protein A ligands are an essential “binding” component of Protein A affinity chromatography resins used in the purification of virtually all mAb-based drugs on the market or in development. We manufacture multiple forms of Protein A ligands under long-term supply agreements with major life sciences companies including Cytiva, MilliporeSigma and Purolite, an Ecolab Inc. company ("Purolite"), who in turn sell their Protein A chromatography resins to end users (mAb manufacturers). We have two manufacturing sites supporting overall global demand for our Protein A ligands: one in Lund, Sweden and another in Waltham, Massachusetts.
Protein A chromatography resins are considered the industry standard for purification of antibody-based therapeutics due to the ability of the Protein A ligand to very selectively bind to or “capture” antibodies from crude protein mixtures. Protein A resins are packed

into the first chromatography column of typically three columns used in a mAb purification process. As a result of Protein A’s high affinity for antibodies, the mAb product is highly purified and concentrated within this first capture step before moving to polishing steps.
In June 2018, we entered into an agreement with Navigo Proteins GmbH (“Navigo”) for the exclusive co-development of multiple affinity ligands for which Repligen holds commercialization rights. We manufacture and exclusively supply the first of these ligands, NGL-Impact® A, to Purolite, for use in their Jetted A50 Protein A resin product. We have a long-term supply agreement with Purolite for NGL-Impact and potential additional affinity ligands that may advance from our Navigo collaboration.
In October 2020, we announced the successful development (with Navigo) of a spike protein ligand, and our plans to manufacture and commercialize the associated chromatography resin as a Repligen branded and marketed product. We subsequently announced the launch of our NGL COVID-19 Spike Protein affinity resin in February 2021. The resin, which targets the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, can be utilized in the purification of certain COVID-19 vaccines. The spike protein is a characterizing feature of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19; it is the primary antigen being evaluated in clinical trials to induce an immune response as a COVID-19 vaccine.
 In September 2021, the Company and Navigo successfully completed co-development of a novel affinity ligand that addresses aggregation issues associated with pH sensitive antibodies and Fc-fusion proteins. We are manufacturing and supplying this ligand, NGL-Impact® HipH, to Purolite.
Also, in September 2021, we completed our strategic acquisition of Avitide, Inc. (“Avitide”), a market leader in affinity ligand discovery and development. This acquisition is a major step forward in building our proteins franchise, and moves Repligen into affinity resin solutions for C&GT and other emerging modalities. This acquisition builds off the excellent partnership with Navigo mentioned above, and strengthens and expands our ligand discovery platform.
 Growth Factors
Most biopharmaceuticals are produced through an upstream mammalian cell culture process. In order to stimulate increased cell growth and maximize overall yield from a bioreactor, manufacturers often add growth factors, such as insulin, to their cell culture media. Our cell culture growth factor additives include LONG® R3 IGF 1, our insulin-like growth factor that has been shown to be up to 100 times more biologically potent than insulin (the industry standard), thereby increasing recombinant protein production in cell culture fermentation applications.

For more information on these acquisitions, see Note 4, “Acquisitions,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
 Our Market Opportunity
Bioprocessing Addressable Market
 The global addressable market for bioprocessing products is estimated to be over $22 billion of which we estimate Repligen’s addressable market to be approximately $8.1 billion at year end 2021. This market includes products used to manufacture therapeutic antibodies, recombinant proteins and vaccines, as well as C&GT.
Monoclonal Antibody Market
 Antibody-based biologics alone accounted for over $130 billion of global biopharma revenue in 2020. Industry sources project the mAbs market to grow in the range of approximately 10% to 12% annually through 2025, driven by new approvals and expanded clinical uses for marketed antibodies, as well as the emergence of biosimilar versions of originator mAbs. As of December 31, 2021, over 120 mAbs were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to treat a diverse range of diseases. R&D remains robust, with more than 800 mAb clinical trials ongoing to address a wide range of medical conditions.

In addition to investments in the discovery and development of novel biologic drugs, there has been substantial investment in follow-on products (biosimilars) by generic and specialty pharmaceutical as well as large biopharmaceutical companies. Development of follow-on products accelerated as the first major mAbs came off patent in the European Union and United States. Due to the high cost of biologic drugs, many countries in developing and emerging markets have been aggressively investing in biomanufacturing capabilities to supply lower cost biosimilars for the local markets. For both originator and follow-on biologics manufacturing, Repligen products are well-positioned to enable greater manufacturing flexibility, production yields and lower costs through improved process efficiencies.
Cell and Gene Therapy Market
 C&GT has emerged in the past few years to become a rapidly growing area of biological drug development, with over 1,200 clinical trials underway at year-end 2020 according to industry sources. Statements by the FDA are supported by industry reports that estimate annual revenue growth of over 25% for the C&GT market through 2025. This scientifically advanced therapeutic approach has unique manufacturing challenges that many of our products can help address. We believe we are well positioned to participate in C&GT production, particularly in the manufacture of plasmids and viral vectors.

To support our sales goals for our direct-to-consumer products, we have invested in our commercial organization. Since 2014, we have significantly expanded our global commercial organization from less than 10, to a commercial team of 309 employees as of December 31, 2021. This includes 211 people in field positions (sales, field applications and field service), and 98 people in internal positions (marketing, customer service and product management). Geographically, 182 members of our commercial team are located in North America, 65 in Europe and 62 in Asia-Pacific ("APAC") regions.
Our bioprocess account managers are supported in each region by bioprocess sales specialists with expertise in filtration, chromatography or process analytics, and by technically trained field applications specialists and field service providers, who can work closely with customers on product demonstrations, implementation and support. We believe that this model helps drive further adoption at our key accounts and also open up new sales opportunities within each region.
Ligand Supply Agreements
For our proteins franchise, we are committed to be a partner of choice for our customers with distributor and supply agreements in place with large life sciences companies such as Cytiva, MilliporeSigma and Purolite. The Cytiva Protein A supply agreement relating to our Waltham, Massachusetts facility was amended in September 2021 and pursuant to its amended terms, runs through 2025. Cytiva moved a portion of its ligand manufacturing in-house in 2020 and under the terms of our existing long-term supply agreements, Cytiva has the ability to move additional manufacturing in house in 2022. Our Protein A supply agreement with MilliporeSigma runs, pursuant to its terms, through 2023, and in 2018 we amended our Protein A supply agreement with Purolite that runs, pursuant to its amended terms, to August 2026 with an option for renewal through 2028. Our dual manufacturing capability provides strong business continuity and reduces overall supply risk for our ligand customers.

In France, 81 employees are under the relevant national and local collective bargaining agreements for metallurgy, comprising approximately 4% of our total workforce.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
 Repligen is committed to conducting business in accordance with the highest ethical standards. This means how we conduct ourselves and our global work is more than just a matter of policy and law; it’s a reflection of our core principles. Our Second Amended and Restated Code of Business Conduct and Ethics reflects Repligen’s five core principles – (1) trustworthiness, (2) respectfulness, (3) responsibility, (4) fairness and (5) corporate citizenship. Our Second Amended and Restated Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applies to all Repligen employees, including those who are integrated into the Company through acquisitions.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 Repligen supports the values of diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”), reflecting our resolute commitment to a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace. We have established talent acquisition processes, as well as training and employee engagement resources, including the formation of a DE&I council, to drive the promotion of diversity and inclusion at all levels of our organization.

 We regularly conduct engagement surveys to gain insight on employee perspectives. Additional channels for employee engagement include CEO-led town halls and Company-wide all-hands meetings.
 Health, Safety and Well-Being
 We actively promote the safety, health and well-being of our employees and end users of our products. Our environmental health and safety policy advances our vision of zero workplace incidents and our efforts to reduce our environmental impacts.
Repligen has continued to focus on employee safety throughout COVID-19 by implementing extensive safety measures, including without limitation on-site COVID-19 testing protocols, detailed contact-tracing if COVID-19 positive cases are detected and flexible remote working options for many of our employees. See the section entitled, “COVID-19 Considerations and Responses” above for more information on the Company’s response to COVID-19.
Intellectual Property
 We are committed to protecting our intellectual property through a combination of patents, trade secrets and trademarks, as well as confidentiality and material transfer agreements. As further described below, we own or have exclusive rights to 203 issued patents and 289 pending patent applications in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions including Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, South Korea, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants, business partners, potential collaborators and major customers to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment, consulting, business relationship, or product related audit or research evaluation. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the other party during the course of the relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and consultants, the agreements generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to Repligen shall be our exclusive property and must be assigned to Repligen.
Filtration
 For our filtration franchise, we are focusing on ATF, TFDF and TFF HF and flat sheet systems, membranes, filters, flow paths and single-use technologies. We continually seek to improve upon these technologies and have multiple new patent filings including patents covering next generation TFDF filters and ATF technology.

 Licensing Agreements
We have entered into multiple licensing and collaboration relationships with third-party business partners in an effort to fully exploit our technology and advance our bioprocessing business strategy.
 Competition
Our bioprocessing products compete on the basis of value proposition, performance, quality, cost effectiveness, and application suitability with numerous established technologies. Additional products using new technologies that may be competitive with our products may also be introduced. Many of the companies selling or developing competitive products, which in some cases include

Cytiva and MilliporeSigma (the life sciences business of Merck KGaA), two of our largest customers, have greater financial and human resources, R&D, manufacturing and marketing experience than we do. They may undertake their own development of products that are substantially similar to or compete with our products and they may succeed in developing products that are more effective or less costly than any that we may develop. These competitors may also prove to be more successful in their production, marketing and commercialization activities. We cannot be certain that the research, development and commercialization efforts of our competitors will not render any of our existing or potential products obsolete.
Manufacturing
A majority of our 16 key manufacturing sites are located in the United States (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York). Outside the United States, we have manufacturing sites in Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden.
