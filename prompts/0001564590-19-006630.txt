Overview 
 We are a late-stage, clinical biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing first-in-class, oral enzyme therapeutics to treat patients with rare and severe metabolic and kidney disorders. We are focused on metabolic disorders that result in excess accumulation of certain metabolites that can cause kidney stones, damage the kidney, and potentially lead to chronic kidney disease, or CKD, and end-stage renal disease, or ESRD. Our lead product candidate, reloxaliase (formerly known as ALLN-177), is a first-in-class, oral enzyme therapeutic that we are developing for the treatment of hyperoxaluria, a metabolic disorder characterized by markedly elevated urinary oxalate levels and commonly associated with kidney stones, CKD and other serious kidney diseases. There are currently no approved therapies for the treatment of hyperoxaluria.
 Reloxaliase, a crystalline formulation of the enzyme oxalate decarboxylase, has been designed to specifically degrade oxalate within the GI tract, limiting systemic absorption of oxalate into the bloodstream. Oxalate is endogenously produced as an end product of normal cellular metabolism and is also absorbed through the GI tract from a typical diet. Humans lack the innate capacity to digest oxalate and primarily depend on renal excretion to eliminate it from the body. Although oxalate has no identified biological function, it is known to damage the kidney when present in excess amounts, a condition called hyperoxaluria. Hyperoxaluria is characterized by significantly elevated oxalate levels in the urine, or urinary oxalate excretion, due to either overproduction of oxalate by the liver from a genetic defect, called primary hyperoxaluria, or from over absorption of oxalate from the diet, called secondary hyperoxaluria. Secondary hyperoxaluria is further characterized either as enteric, resulting from a chronic and unremediable underlying GI disorder associated with malabsorption, such as bariatric surgery complications or Crohn’s disease, which predisposes patients to excess oxalate absorption, or idiopathic, meaning the underlying cause is unknown. Enteric hyperoxaluria is the more severe type of secondary hyperoxaluria. 
 We have conducted a robust clinical development program of reloxaliase, including three Phase 2 clinical trials, which demonstrated reductions of urinary oxalate excretion in patients with secondary hyperoxaluria, particularly in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. Reloxaliase has also been well tolerated in clinical trials to date. Based on these data, the high unmet medical need, the enzyme’s specific mechanism of action, and the significant market opportunity, we are initially developing reloxaliase for adult patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. 
 In March 2018, we initiated URIROX-1 (formerly Study 301), the first of our two Phase 3 clinical trials in support of our planned Biologics License Application, or BLA, for reloxaliase in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. URIROX-1 is the largest randomized, controlled trial of a novel therapeutic ever initiated in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. We expect to announce topline data from this trial in the second half of 2019.  In the fourth quarter of 2018 we initiated URIROX-2 (formerly Study 302), our second pivotal Phase 3 trial of reloxaliase in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria.  The primary efficacy endpoint for URIROX-2 is the percent change from baseline in 24-hour urinary oxalate, or UOx, excretion during Weeks 1-4, comparing reduction in the average UOx excretion across Weeks 1-4 with reloxaliase to placebo, the same primary efficacy endpoint as URIROX-1. 
 The FDA has advised us that it agrees with our strategy to pursue a BLA submission for reloxaliase using the accelerated approval regulatory pathway.  Accordingly, we intend to use data from the URIROX-2 trial to first support a filing for accelerated approval for reloxaliase and thereafter to verify its clinical benefit associated with reduction in kidney stone disease progression, which is the primary long-term endpoint of the study.  URIROX-2 also incorporates adaptive design elements that allow for increases in sample size and duration of treatment based on accrued kidney stone disease progression rates and the conditional probability of achieving ultimate statistical success in the long-term follow-up phase of the trial.  We currently expect to submit a BLA to the FDA after 400 patients have been randomized and followed in URIROX-2 for six months. For the long-term follow-up phase of the trial, subjects would continue in the study for a minimum treatment period of two years to confirm clinical benefit post-approval.  
 The FDA has also granted separate orphan drug designations for reloxaliase for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria and for the treatment of pediatric hyperoxaluria. In addition, the European Commission has granted orphan designation for reloxaliase for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria. In light of these designations, we initiated an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial (Study 206) in March 2018 in adolescents and adults with primary hyperoxaluria or enteric hyperoxaluria, who also have elevated levels of oxalate in the blood, or hyperoxalemia, which can lead to systemic oxalosis, a potentially fatal disorder

associated with deposition of oxalate in tissues. We expect to announce initial data from Study 206 in the second quarter of 2019 and topline data in the second half of 2019.
 The first clinical manifestation of hyperoxaluria is often a kidney stone; however, the disorder can be variable in its presentation. Patients with severe hyperoxaluria may have recurrent kidney stones or experience infrequent or no kidney stones, yet still develop CKD and end-stage renal disease, which can be fatal. Systemic oxalosis, which typically occurs in patients with primary or severe secondary hyperoxaluria and declining kidney function, refers to the presence of excess oxalate throughout the body, including the blood, bones, joints, eyes and heart. 
 We estimate there are approximately 200,000 to 250,000 patients in the United States with enteric hyperoxaluria and kidney stones. We plan to target this market initially. There are no FDA approved therapies for enteric hyperoxaluria. We believe that a therapeutic agent that reduces urine oxalate levels in this population could be commercialized into a potential multi-billion dollar U.S. market without any approved therapies at present. Primary hyperoxaluria, an ultra-rare genetic disease, is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 58,000, or approximately 5,000 patients, in the United States. Among patients with primary hyperoxaluria, about 50 percent will have kidney failure by age 15, and about 80 percent will have kidney failure by age 30. There are no FDA approved therapies for primary hyperoxaluria, and the most severe patients may be treated with a liver and/or kidney transplant. Patients with enteric hyperoxaluria can have levels of urinary oxalate excretion as high as patients with primary hyperoxaluria and a comparable renal burden.
 Systemic oxalosis is an ultra-rare, potentially fatal condition that results from the progression of primary or enteric hyperoxaluria. Excess oxalate that cannot be eliminated by the kidneys begins to accumulate in the tissue throughout the body, including the blood, bones, joints, eyes, heart and kidneys. The deposition of oxalate crystals can increase the risk of kidney inflammation, fibrosis, and progressive kidney failure. This damage to the kidney further reduces the kidney’s ability to eliminate oxalate, causing a vicious cycle that can accelerate the loss of renal function. Patients who develop ESRD secondary to hyperoxaluria require frequent hemodialysis—approximately 6 or 7 times per week—with or without supplemental peritoneal dialysis while awaiting kidney transplantation to prevent or limit systemic oxalosis. 
 We believe our proprietary know-how in enzyme technology allows for the design, development, formulation, and scalable manufacturing of non-absorbed and stable enzymes delivered orally and in sufficient doses for activity in the GI tract. This approach enables us to develop enzyme therapies that degrade metabolites within the GI tract, which reduces potentially toxic metabolite levels in the blood and urine, and in turn, diminishes the disease burden on the kidney over time. The general therapeutic approach of deploying a non-absorbed drug into the GI tract to reduce metabolic disease burden in patients with kidney disease has been proven successful in several therapeutic categories. Utilizing our proprietary technological approach, we conceived and developed our first two product candidates, reloxaliase and ALLN-346, which are novel, oral enzyme therapeutics for the treatment of hyperoxaluria and hyperuricemia. Our proprietary and scalable manufacturing capabilities have enabled us to produce large quantities of reloxaliase sufficiently to support our clinical and commercial strategy, with costs anticipated to be comparable to small molecule therapeutics.
 We have designed our second product candidate, ALLN-346, an orally administered, novel, urate degrading enzyme, for patients with hyperuricemia and gout in the setting of advanced CKD. Hyperuricemia, or elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, results from overproduction or insufficient excretion of urate, or often a combination of the two. Humans lack urate oxidase, an enzyme that degrades uric acid in a wide range of other organisms, including animals, plants, bacteria and fungi. Hyperuricemia is the major predisposing condition for gout, a disease that most commonly manifests with acute flares of arthritis, and can also lead to chronic arthritis and joint damage and palpable deposits of urate crystals in the skin. Hyperuricemia can also lead to increased uric acid excretion in the urine and subsequently to kidney stone formation and kidney damage, also known as urate nephropathy. In addition, hyperuricemia has been linked to hypertension, CKD, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and obesity.
 We engineered ALLN-346 to degrade urate in the GI tract and, in turn, reduce the urate burden on the kidney and lower the risk of urate-related complications. ALLN-346 is targeted to lower serum uric acid in patients with CKD, who have decreased renal function and diminished capacity for urinary excretion of uric acid. Patients with renal impairment who have hyperuricemia and gout are often not optimally managed due to limitations of available therapies, including decreased tolerability, dose restrictions, drug-drug interactions, contraindications and increased risk for long-term morbidity and mortality. An estimated 375,000 patients in the United States have refractory gout and CKD.  
 Our Product Candidate Pipeline 
 Using our proprietary technological approach, we have developed a pipeline of first-in-class, oral, non-absorbed enzyme therapeutic candidates to treat patients with rare and severe metabolic disorders that affect the kidney. Our lead product 
 6


candidate, reloxaliase, is an oral enzyme therapeutic that we are developing for the treatment of hyperoxaluria, for which there are currently no approved therapies. Our second product candidate, ALLN-346, is being developed for patients with hyperuricemia and moderate to severe CKD. Hyperuricemia, or elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, is commonly associated with gout as well as kidney stones and kidney disorders. 

Strategy 
 Our goal is to become the leader in developing and commercializing first-in-class, oral, non-absorbed enzyme therapeutics to treat patients with rare and severe metabolic and kidney disorders. To achieve this goal, we are executing on the following strategy: 

• | Obtain regulatory approval in the United States for our lead product candidate, reloxaliase, for enteric hyperoxaluria in adults using the accelerated approval regulatory pathway- We have conducted a robust Phase 2 clinical development program of reloxaliase in patients with secondary hyperoxaluria, which demonstrated significant reductions of urinary oxalate excretion in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. Based on these data and the high unmet need, we are initially developing reloxaliase for enteric hyperoxaluria. Moreover, we believe the mechanism of action of reloxaliase, which degrades oxalate in the GI tract, is particularly well-targeted to treat enteric hyperoxaluria where excess oxalate absorption is driven by an underlying GI disorder. In March of 2018, we initiated URIROX-1, our first Phase 3 clinical trial in support of our planned BLA for reloxaliase in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria, with topline data anticipated in the second half of 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2018 we initiated URIROX-2 (formerly Study 302), our second pivotal Phase 3 trial of reloxaliase in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. The FDA has advised us that it agrees with our strategy to pursue a BLA submission for reloxaliase using the accelerated approval regulatory pathway. We expect to submit a BLA to the FDA after 400 patients have been randomized and followed for six months. For the long-term follow-up phase of the trial, subjects would continue in the study for a minimum treatment period of two years to confirm clinical benefit post-approval.

• | Commercialize reloxaliase-We have worldwide commercialization and development rights to reloxaliase. We intend to independently pursue regulatory approval of reloxaliase in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria in the United States and, if approved, to commercialize the product by building a focused commercial organization in the United States specifically to target nephrologists and urologists who treat patients with hyperoxaluria, particularly at kidney stone clinics.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance development of reloxaliase for other severe forms of hyperoxaluria- Systemic oxalosis is an ultra-rare potentially life threatening condition that results from the progression of primary or enteric hyperoxaluria. Our preclinical studies in models of primary hyperoxaluria and severe secondary hyperoxaluria have demonstrated that reloxaliase significantly reduced oxalate levels in the urine and plasma. The FDA has granted separate orphan drug designations for reloxaliase for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria and for the treatment of pediatric hyperoxaluria (primary and secondary). In light of these designations, we initiated an open-label Phase 2 clinical

trial (Study 206) in March 2018 in adolescents and adults with primary hyperoxaluria or enteric hyperoxaluria, who also have elevated levels of oxalate in the blood, or hyperoxalemia, which can lead to systemic oxalosis, a potentially fatal disorder associated deposition of oxalate in tissues. We expect to announce initial data from Study 206 in the second quarter of 2019 and topline data from Study 206 in the second half of 2019. In addition, we plan to seek breakthrough designation where appropriate. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Obtain regulatory approval in Europe for our lead product candidate, reloxaliase- The prevalence of severe hyperoxaluria in Europe is comparable to that in the United States. Based on a market research project we commissioned, enteric hyperoxaluria is estimated to affect roughly 300,000 people in the EU5 (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom). Also analogous to the US, primary hyperoxaluria is estimated to affect approximately 5,000 people in the European Union according to the European Commission’s Platform on Rare Diseases Registration. As a result, we plan to pursue regulatory approval for patients with severe hyperoxaluria in Europe in conjunction with our pursuit of approval in the United States. We received Scientific Advice on the design of our proposed Phase 3 program from the regulatory agencies of three countries in the European Union. In these meetings, we discussed the results of our Phase 2 clinical program in secondary hyperoxaluria, our proposed pivotal Phase 3 program in enteric hyperoxaluria, and potential regulatory pathways for approval in Europe. Following these non-binding regulatory interactions, we believe that our Phase 3 program, if successful, could be eligible for a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA via the conditional approval pathway, which is similar to the FDA’s accelerated approval pathway. We have initiated European sites for URIROX-1 and Study 206 and also plan to do so for URIROX-2.

• | Advance development of ALLN-346-ALLN-346 is an orally administered, novel urate degrading enzyme that has been optimized for stability in the GI tract. This proprietary enzyme was designed by our scientists to degrade urate in the GI tract and in turn, reduce the urate burden on the kidney and lower the risk of urate-related complications. ALLN-346 is targeted to lower serum uric acid in patients with CKD, who have decreased renal function and diminished capacity for urinary excretion of uric acid. In June 2018, we announced completion of a preclinical proof-of-concept study and presented the data at the American College of Rheumatology meeting on October 22, 2018. The poster presentation included data demonstrating urate reduction in a urate oxidase knock-out mouse model, an animal model of severe hyperuricemia with kidney damage due to urate crystal deposition. After one week of treatment, mice treated with ALLN-346 achieved a robust reduction in urate burden on the kidney, as evidenced by normalization in urine uric acid and a significant reduction in plasma urate. We believe this study supports our selection of ALLN-346 as our lead product candidate for the treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with gout and associated CKD. Based on the results of this study, we are scaling our manufacturing processes to support customary toxicology and additional preclinical studies. Subject to the successful completion of these activities, we expect to file an IND for ALLN-346 with the FDA in the second half of 2019 and to initiate our first clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of ALLN-346 in patients with hyperuricemia and gout, including patients with CKD in the first half of 2020.

• | Explore collaboration opportunities for our product candidates in markets outside of the United States. We intend to explore collaborations to commercialize our product candidates, including reloxaliase, outside of the United States. However, depending on our evaluation of these market opportunities and the strategic merits of these collaboration opportunities, we may decide to retain commercial rights in key markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Use our proprietary technological approach to develop additional orally-administered enzyme therapies that degrade metabolites in the GI tract. We are employing a proprietary technological approach that allows for the design, development, formulation, and scalable manufacturing of oral, non-absorbed, stable enzymes that degrade a specific metabolite within the GI tract. We believe our expertise in orally administered gut-restricted enzyme therapeutics has the potential to serve as a product engine that can be utilized to address other rare and severe metabolic disorders with high unmet medical needs. We plan to continue to expand our platform to create, develop, and bring to market additional first-in-class product candidates.

Reloxaliase
 Overview of Oxalate and Hyperoxaluria 
 Oxalate is endogenously produced as an end product of normal cellular metabolism and is also absorbed from a typical diet. Oxalate is present in many foods, especially healthy foods like plants, including green leafy vegetables, fruits and nuts, because plants utilize oxalate to store calcium. Oxalate does not have a known productive role in normal human physiology. Humans lack the innate capacity to digest oxalate, and oxalate is largely excreted unchanged by the kidney in the urine. In addition, bacteria in the GI tract, especially Oxalobacter formigenes, play a variable role in degrading oxalate in some patients. Progressively elevated levels of oxalate in the urine increase the risk for kidney stones and other serious kidney diseases. 
 Hyperoxaluria is a serious metabolic disorder characterized by markedly elevated levels of urinary oxalate excretion, due to either overproduction of oxalate by the liver from a genetic defect, called primary hyperoxaluria, or from over absorption of oxalate from the diet, called secondary hyperoxaluria. Secondary hyperoxaluria often leads to recurrent and frequent kidney stones, placing this patient population at higher risk for CKD, and end-stage renal disease, or ESRD. Secondary hyperoxaluria is further characterized either as enteric, resulting from a chronic and unremediable underlying GI disorder associated with malabsorption, or idiopathic, meaning the underlying cause is unknown. Enteric hyperoxaluria is the more severe type of secondary hyperoxaluria since the underlying GI disorder predisposes patients to chronic excess oxalate absorption. Given this hyperabsorption, patients with enteric hyperoxaluria can have levels of urinary oxalate excretion comparable to patients with primary hyperoxaluria. 
 9


The diagnosis and subsequent management of hyperoxaluria are typically based on measurements of oxalate levels in samples of urine voided and collected over a full 24 hour period, referred to as 24 hour urinary oxalate excretion. Hyperoxaluria is generally defined as levels of urinary oxalate excretion greater than 40 mg/24 hour at ages beyond infancy. While there is no firmly established level of urinary oxalate excretion that results in kidney stone formation, the scientific literature suggests that sustained urinary oxalate excretion above 30-40 mg/24 hour increases the risk of stone formation and that higher baseline urinary oxalate excretion is predictive of future stone events. Independent academic studies have shown that an increase in urinary oxalate excretion of approximately 10 mg/24 hour can increase the risk of significant adverse kidney complications. We consider severe hyperoxaluria as having levels of oxalate in the urine greater than 50 mg/24 hour. For example, the average urinary oxalate excretion level at baseline for the subjects with enteric hyperoxaluria in our most recently completed Phase 2 clinical trial was 103 mg/24 hour. Analysis of data from our clinical trials and multiple independent studies, including, but not limited to, peer-reviewed academic studies published in Nephron in 1980, The New England Journal of Medicine in 1994 and 2002, Kidney International in 2006 and 2008, the Urology Journal in 2011, the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology in 2016 and, most recently, the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology Abstract Supplement in 2017, suggest that a therapeutic strategy that reduces urinary oxalate excretion per 24 hours by approximately 20% could result in a 25-50% reduction in the incidence of kidney stone recurrence (in the short term) and may increase renal survival (in the long term). 
 

 
* | The complications noted in the figure represent a general progression of kidney harm and disease associated with increasing urinary oxalate excretion levels. Not all patients experience this progression and there is considerable variability among individuals between urinary oxalate excretion levels and kidney function and disease.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Secondary Hyperoxaluria 
 Secondary hyperoxaluria, or increased urinary oxalate excretion resulting from excess absorption of oxalate from the GI tract, falls into two categories: 
  
• | Enteric, the more severe form of secondary hyperoxaluria, which results from an underlying chronic and unremediable GI disorder; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Idiopathic, which has no known cause. Some patients with idiopathic hyperoxaluria can have severe disease characterized by hyperabsorption of oxalate with manifestations similar to enteric patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Enteric hyperoxaluria is most commonly seen as a complication of malabsorptive bariatric surgical procedures, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and can also be related to inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn’s disease, or other conditions associated with GI malabsorption, including cystic fibrosis, pancreatic insufficiency, celiac disease or short bowel syndrome following surgical resection of the bowel. Enteric hyperoxaluria is the more severe type of secondary hyperoxaluria since the underlying GI disorder predisposes patients to chronic excess oxalate absorption. Given this hyperabsorption, patients with enteric hyperoxaluria can have markedly high levels of urinary oxalate excretion that can result in recurrent kidney stones, progressive calcium oxalate (CaOx) deposits in the kidney, or nephrocalcinosis, systemic oxalosis, CKD and ESRD. We 
 10


estimate there are approximately 200,000 to 250,000 patients in the United States with enteric hyperoxaluria and kidney stones. We plan to target this market initially. There are no FDA approved therapies for enteric hyperoxaluria. We believe that a therapeutic agent that reduces urine oxalate levels in this population could be commercialized into a potential multi-billion dollar U.S. market without any approved therapies at present. 
 Idiopathic hyperoxaluria has no known underlying cause and patients with the disorder exhibit varying levels of oxalate absorption from their diet. A number of physiological parameters influence the absorption of dietary oxalate, including intestinal pH and transit time, type of diet, and the amount of other compounds and elements, such as calcium and magnesium, present in the GI tract. Consequently, a subgroup of patients with idiopathic hyperoxaluria hyperabsorbs oxalate from their diets at levels similar to those patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. 
 Primary Hyperoxaluria 
 Primary hyperoxaluria, a type of severe hyperoxaluria, is a rare genetic disorder that can result in kidney stone disease, kidney damage, and kidney failure, which may lead to death. Primary hyperoxaluria has three main types, PH1, PH2, and PH3, with each categorization representing the particular genetic enzyme deficiency that drives the overproduction of oxalate, mainly in the liver, and massive excretion of oxalate in the urine. The most severe and common type of primary hyperoxaluria is PH1. These patients typically develop recurrent kidney stones with progressive nephrocalcinosis and end stage renal disease by 20-30 years of age. Among patients with primary hyperoxaluria, about 50 percent will have kidney failure by age 15, and about 80 percent will have kidney failure by age 30. Primary hyperoxaluria is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 58,000, or approximately 5,000 patients in the United States, and approximately 0.1 in 10,000 people, or approximately 5,000 patients in the Europe. There are no FDA approved therapies for primary hyperoxaluria, and the most severe patients may be treated with a liver and/or kidney transplant. Patients with enteric hyperoxaluria can have levels of urinary oxalate excretion as high as patients with primary hyperoxaluria and a comparable renal burden. 
 Hyperoxaluria-Patient Journey and Progression of Disease 
 The first clinical manifestation of hyperoxaluria is often a kidney stone; however, the disorder can be variable in its presentation. Patients with severe hyperoxaluria may have recurrent kidney stones or experience infrequent or no kidney stones, yet still develop CKD and ESRD, which can be fatal. The risk for kidney stones increases with progressively elevated levels of urinary oxalate excretion. Up to 80% of kidney stones contain oxalate; therefore hyperoxaluria is a primary driver of kidney stones and reducing urinary oxalate is a scientifically targeted approach to prevent kidney stone episodes. Patients experiencing a kidney stone typically go to the emergency room for treatment due to the intense physical pain, as the kidney stone may take hours to days to pass or require interventional surgical procedures to remove it if it is too large to pass on its own. Kidney stones affect approximately 1 in 11 people in the United States at some point in their lives and the likelihood of recurrence has been estimated to be as high as 50% within 5 years of the initial event. Based on a project completed in 2016 by Health Advances, a strategic consulting firm for the healthcare industry that we engaged to conduct market research, approximately 5 million patients have been affected by recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stones in the United States. 
 Given the debilitating and recurrent nature of kidney stones, patients suffering from recurrent kidney stones bear significant social and financial burdens and are therefore highly motivated to prevent further relapse. Patients with enteric hyperoxaluria tend to have more frequent and more complicated kidney stone episodes and other kidney disorders as a result of their underlying GI disorders and predisposition to chronic excess oxalate absorption. For example, an additional project completed by Health Advances for us in 2017, which included analysis of peer-reviewed academic studies in two patient populations with GI malabsorption (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and short bowel syndrome), suggested that these patients had a significantly higher kidney stone risk and rate of kidney stone recurrence than the general population of patients with kidney stones. They also had a significantly higher rate of intervention to remove kidney stones. This significant burden of disease in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria is consistent with the clinical presentation of patients participating in our Phase 2 clinical program. In October 2018 we presented data at the American Society of Nephrology conference which included composite data, details on kidney stone burden, and case studies from 33 patients with enteric hyperoxaluria who enrolled across our three Phase 2 studies of reloxaliase. Data from these 33 patients showed that a majority of the patients experienced persistently high 24-hour urinary oxalate (UOx) excretion, despite following standard-of-care guidance for diet and hydration.  On average, these subjects experienced six stones prior to enrollment. Among 20 patients for whom kidney stone burden was assessed by a computerized tomography, or CT, scan, 16 had at least one kidney stone detected at enrollment (80%), with an average of three stones present.  Additionally, 20% of patients presenting with a kidney stone had very large stones, which could require urological intervention. In addition to kidney stone burden, nearly 30% of subjects had moderate CKD (stage 3). Based upon a separate analysis of claims data obtained from Truvan Health Analytics, part of the IBM Watson Health business, we estimate that enteric hyperoxaluria patients with new onset kidney stones, including those who have developed new onset CKD, on average incur approximately $66,000 annually in direct medical costs within a 4-year period after a malabsorptive surgical procedure or underlying GI disease diagnosis associated with risk of enteric hyperoxaluria.

Further, people with kidney stones have a two times greater risk of CKD and ESRD and a higher risk of stroke and heart attack than the general population. Managing CKD and ESRD is complex as many metabolic factors, such as phosphorus, potassium and parathyroid hormone, are out of balance, often requiring treatment with multiple therapeutic agents. Patients who develop ESRD secondary to hyperoxaluria require frequent hemodialysis-approximately 6 or 7 times per week-with or without supplemental peritoneal dialysis while awaiting kidney transplantation to prevent or limit systemic oxalosis. Systemic oxalosis, which typically occurs in patients with primary or severe secondary hyperoxaluria and declining kidney function, refers to the presence of excess oxalate throughout the body, including the blood, bones, joints, eyes and heart. Elevated levels of oxalate in the blood is referred to as hyperoxalemia. For example, a publication in Kidney International in 2018 provided a systematic review on secondary oxalate nephropathy case reports (108 patients total), the majority attributable to enteric hyperoxaluria. In this study, oxalate crystal deposition was universally found in the kidneys, suggesting a causal role for the oxalate crystals.  With a mean follow-up of 12.9 months, renal replacement therapy (dialysis) was required in >50% of patients with most patients remaining dialysis-dependent and an overall mortality rate was 33%.  
 Patients with enteric hyperoxaluria are at risk for developing CKD, and those who receive a kidney transplant for ESRD due to oxalate-related kidney damage remain at risk for recurrent oxalate-related kidney damage. Primary and enteric hyperoxaluria patients with high urinary oxalate concentrations can develop nephrocalcinosis, which can lead to kidney failure. 
 Hyperoxaluria Current Treatment and Unmet Need 
 There is no approved pharmacologic therapy for the reduction of urinary oxalate excretion in patients with hyperoxaluria, either primary or secondary. Existing treatment options for hyperoxaluria generally are non-specific and include high fluid intake to increase urine output to more than two to three liters per day, a diet low in salt and oxalate, oral citrate and/or calcium and/or magnesium supplementation and, exclusively for the subset of responsive patients with the most severe form of primary hyperoxaluria (PH1), orthophosphate and Vitamin B6 supplementation. Despite these strategies, many patients continue to experience hyperoxaluria with recurrent kidney stones and continued risk for long-term kidney damage. Consequently, we believe patients afflicted with severe hyperoxaluria could greatly benefit from a therapy that reliably lowers oxalate levels in the body and therefore reduces the burden on the kidney to filter and then excrete the metabolite in the urine. 
 There are no FDA-approved therapies for enteric hyperoxaluria and no approved pharmacologic therapies specifically directed at reducing oxalate absorption driven by an underlying GI disorder. Current management of enteric hyperoxaluria relies on strategies to reduce dietary oxalate intake, increase calcium intake and drink large volumes of fluid. Increased oral fluid intake results in increased urine volume, with the goal of decreasing the saturation of oxalate in the urine and therefore reducing the risk of kidney stone formation and/or more severe kidney diseases. However, because patients with enteric hyperoxaluria have an underlying GI condition predisposing them to chronically hyperabsorb oxalate, this population often finds it particularly difficult to consistently ingest the quantities of fluid required to maintain adequate urine volume. In addition, recommendations for a low oxalate diet are somewhat in conflict with general recommendations for a healthy diet of largely plant-based foods. Many plants are high in oxalate, making it difficult to adhere to a low oxalate diet, given the relatively large number of healthy foods with moderate or high oxalate content. The limited medicinal options to treat calcium oxalate kidney stones, including thiazide diuretics and potassium citrate, have suboptimal efficacy, are not targeted to oxalate, and can be difficult to tolerate in patients with GI diseases. 
 We believe that reloxaliase can address unmet medical needs for patients with severe hyperoxaluria, who experience recurrent kidney stones, CKD, end-stage renal disease and other serious kidney diseases. Reloxaliase, if approved, would be the first therapeutic option that directly degrades oxalate in the GI tract using a mechanism of action specifically targeted to reducing excess absorption of oxalate. 
 Our Solution: Reloxaliase
 Our lead product candidate, reloxaliase, is a first-in-class, non-absorbed, orally-administered enzyme for the treatment of hyperoxaluria. Reloxaliase, a crystalline formulation of the enzyme oxalate decarboxylase, has been designed to specifically degrade oxalate into formate and carbon dioxide within the GI tract, thus limiting systemic absorption of oxalate into the bloodstream. The decrease in systemic absorption reduces the burden on the kidney to filter and then excrete oxalate in the urine and, in turn, reduces the risk of kidney stones and other serious kidney diseases. 
 We are initially developing reloxaliase for adult patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. As summarized in the table below, we have evaluated reloxaliase in 113 subjects with secondary hyperoxaluria in three Phase 2 clinical trials, of whom 33 subjects had enteric hyperoxaluria, and a Phase 1 clinical trial with 33 healthy volunteers with diet-induced hyperoxaluria. Based on these data, particularly the significant reductions in urinary oxalate excretion observed in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria in our Phase 2 clinical program, we initiated URIROX-1, the first of two Phase 3 clinical trials in March 2018, with topline data anticipated in the second half of 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2018 we initiated URIROX-2 (formerly Study 
 12


302), our second pivotal Phase 3 trial of reloxaliase in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria.  The FDA has advised us that it agrees with our strategy to pursue a BLA submission for reloxaliase using the accelerated approval regulatory pathway. We expect to submit a BLA to the FDA after 400 patients have been randomized and followed for six months. For the long-term follow-up phase of the trial, subjects would continue in the study for a minimum treatment period of two years to confirm clinical benefit post-approval. 
 In addition, the FDA has granted separate orphan drug designations for reloxaliase for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria and for the treatment of pediatric hyperoxaluria. The European Commission has also granted orphan designation for reloxaliase for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria. In light of these designations, we initiated an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial (Study 206) in March 2018 in adolescents and adults with primary hyperoxaluria or enteric hyperoxaluria, who also have elevated levels of oxalate in the blood, or hyperoxalemia, which can lead to systemic oxalosis, a potentially fatal disorder associated deposition of oxalate in tissues. We expect to announce initial data from Study 206 in the second quarter of 2019 and topline data from Study 206 in the second half of 2019. 
 Clinical Development Program 
 Overview
Since 2012, we have conducted a robust clinical development program of reloxaliase in healthy volunteers and patients with secondary hyperoxaluria. As a result, we have developed key insights into hyperoxaluria, clinical trials in patients with hyperoxaluria and the activity and tolerability of reloxaliase in this patient population. In our Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, we demonstrated proof of concept that the GI tract could be used for reducing the renal oxalate burden, as measured by 24 hour urinary oxalate excretion. Our Phase 2 clinical program was designed to identify the optimal patient population, registrational endpoint and trial design for our planned pivotal Phase 3 program. In the aggregate, our clinical development program to date has demonstrated that: 

• | reloxaliase can substantially reduce urinary oxalate excretion in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reloxaliase has been well-tolerated, with no drug-related serious or severe adverse events; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the effect of reloxaliase was specific to oxalate, with minimal to no changes in non-oxalate urine parameters.

 The table below summarizes our clinical trial experience with reloxaliase to date.
 

Summary of Completed Phase 2 Clinical Trials
Study 713-Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with Secondary Hyperoxaluria 
 We completed a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of reloxaliase in patients with secondary hyperoxaluria. The enrollment criteria consisted of patients with either idiopathic or enteric hyperoxaluria with at least 50 mg/24 hour in urinary oxalate, or UOx, excretion at screening, most of whom had a history of kidney stones. We designed the trial to measure the ability of reloxaliase to reduce UOx levels in this patient population, with additional planned analysis in subgroups of secondary hyperoxaluria. The primary endpoint was reduction in UOx excretion from baseline to Week 4. We specified key secondary endpoints including a measure of time-weighted average, or TWA, 24 hour UOx excretion over the four weeks of the trial and percent change in UOx excretion from baseline to Week 4. TWA 24 hour UOx excretion is the average of all 24 hour UOx excretion values obtained while on study

drug (reloxaliase or placebo), with each value weighted for the number of days since the last urine collection. We believe this measurement better captures the durability of metabolic control. We also performed various post-hoc analyses on the data.
 In the trial, 71 subjects were randomized to receive either a 7,500 unit oral dose of reloxaliase or placebo three times per day with meals, for 28 days. A total of 67 subjects received treatment (32 reloxaliase and 35 placebo), and comprised the modified intent-to-treat and safety populations. Subjects with enteric hyperoxaluria accounted for 34% of the reloxaliase group (11 subjects) and 20% of the placebo group (7 subjects). Subjects with idiopathic hyperoxaluria accounted for 66% of the reloxaliase group (21 subjects) and 80% of the placebo group (28 subjects). On average, subjects with enteric hyperoxaluria had markedly higher UOx excretion levels at baseline (103 mg/24 hour) than the subjects with idiopathic hyperoxaluria (57 mg/24 hour), and despite consuming roughly half the amount of dietary oxalate as idiopathic subjects, their baseline UOx excretion levels were approximately twice as high. 
 Key efficacy results from this Phase 2 clinical trial included: 
  
• | In the overall population, reduction in 24 hour UOx excretion from baseline to Week 4 (the primary endpoint of the trial) was greater in subjects treated with reloxaliase (LS mean1 = -8.75 mg/24 hour) compared to subjects who received placebo (LS mean = -2.40 mg/24 hour); however, the difference between treatment groups (LS mean = -6.35 mg/24 hour) did not reach statistical significance (p2 = 0.160).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the subgroup with enteric hyperoxaluria, reduction in 24 hour UOx excretion from baseline to Week 4 was substantially greater in subjects treated with reloxaliase (LS mean = -21.31 mg/24 hour) compared to subjects who received placebo (LS mean = -4.86 mg/24 hour), and the treatment difference was LS mean = -16.45 mg/24 hour (p = 0.184). The magnitude of the treatment effect was substantially greater than what was observed in the overall population. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the overall population, reduction in 24 hour UOx excretion from baseline to TWA across Weeks 1-4 (a key pre-specified secondary endpoint of the trial) was substantially greater in subjects treated with reloxaliase (LS mean = -9.08 mg/24 hour) compared to subjects who received placebo (LS mean = -0.96 mg/24 hour), and the difference between treatment groups was LS mean = -8.13 mg/24 hour (p = 0.016).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the subgroup with enteric hyperoxaluria, reduction in 24 hour UOx excretion from baseline to TWA across Weeks 1-4 was substantially greater in subjects treated with reloxaliase (LS mean = -25.34 mg/24 hour) compared to subjects who received placebo (LS mean = +0.35 mg/24 hour), and the treatment difference was LS mean = -25.69 mg/24 hour (p==0.018). As with the primary efficacy endpoint, the magnitude of the treatment effect was substantially greater than what was observed in the overall population.

2 | A p-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of clinical results. A p-value of 0.05 or less is generally considered to represent statistical significance, meaning that there is a less than 1-in-20 likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the overall population, percent reduction in 24 hour UOx excretion from baseline to Week 4 (a pre-specified secondary endpoint of the trial) was greater in subjects treated with reloxaliase (LS mean = -10.37%) compared to subjects who received placebo (LS mean = +5.45%), and the treatment difference was LS mean = -15.81% (p = 0.016).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the subgroup with enteric hyperoxaluria, percent reduction in 24 hour UOx excretion from baseline to Week 4 was substantially greater in subjects treated with reloxaliase (LS mean = -20.21%) compared to subjects who received placebo (LS mean = +16.03%), and the treatment difference was LS mean = -36.25% (p = 0.046). The magnitude of the treatment effect was substantially greater than what was observed in the overall population.

• | In the overall population, the proportion of subjects with a > 20% reduction in 24 hour UOx excretion from baseline to TWA across Weeks 1 to 4 (a post-hoc analysis) was greater in subjects treated with reloxaliase (40.6%) compared to subjects who received placebo (8.6%), with an odds ratio3, or OR, of 9.59 (p = 0.006).

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Additional key findings:
  
• | The trial demonstrated reloxaliase to be well tolerated and all 32 subjects treated with reloxaliase completed the trial. Treatment emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, were reported at a lower incidence in subjects receiving reloxaliase (16 subjects or 50.0%) compared to subjects receiving placebo (22 subjects or 62.9%). The incidence of TEAEs that were considered related to the study drug was also lower in subjects treated with reloxaliase (9.4%) compared with subjects who received placebo (22.9%). Among subjects with enteric hyperoxaluria, TEAEs were also reported at a lower frequency in the reloxaliase group (6 of 11 subjects, or 54.5%) compared with the placebo group (5 of 7 subjects, or 71.4%). Similar to the overall population, GI-related TEAEs (the most common type of adverse event) were reported at a lower frequency in the reloxaliase group (3 of 11 subjects, or 27.3%) compared with the placebo group (3 of 7 subjects, or 42.9%). While two subjects in the placebo group experienced TEAEs (nausea and dermatitis) that led to withdrawal from the trial, there were no TEAEs that led to withdrawal from the trial among the subjects treated with reloxaliase. There were no deaths, severe or serious adverse events, or SAEs, reported during the trial. There were no clinically important changes in laboratory values, vital signs or physical examinations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We observed intra-individual variability in UOx excretion that may have arisen from changes in diet, metabolic activity, hydration status or other factors. Consequently, we believe TWA UOx excretion per 24 hours over the study period is a clinically meaningful endpoint because it reflects the physiological effect of metabolic control of UOx excretion over time and dampens the effect of intra-individual variability in 24 hour UOx excretion. There have been several approved metabolic disease therapies that utilized a TWA measure as the endpoint for their pivotal clinical program.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The effects of reloxaliase were observed to be highly specific to oxalate, as there were minimal to no changes in other non-oxalate urine parameters, such as calcium, citrate, sodium and urinary volume, between baseline and Week 4 in subjects on reloxaliase.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We observed from diet recall data that subjects with enteric hyperoxaluria consumed on average more than three meals per day and more than two snacks per day. On average, they consumed 28% of their total daily oxalate intake from snacks, with snacks accounting for 40-50% of daily oxalate intake in some subjects. In the trial, subjects received either a 7,500 unit oral dose of reloxaliase (22,500 units/day) or placebo three times per day with meals. As a result of their eating patterns, subjects in the subgroup with enteric hyperoxaluria therefore consumed

 16


 
a significant portion of their daily oxalate intake without treatment. Patients with enteric hyperoxaluria often have individualized dietary patterns, particularly patients following bariatric surgery, who are typically advised to eat frequent, smaller meals. These data informed our decision to tailor the dosing regimen in our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for patients with enteric hyperoxaluria in order to maximize the therapeutic effect of reloxaliase. We will dose subjects in URIROX-1 with 7,500 units of reloxaliase with each meal and/or snack, up to five times per day (up to 37,500 units/day). This dosing regimen is consistent with the eating patterns of patients with enteric hyperoxaluria and is designed to provide reloxaliase at most meals and snacks in order to maximize the degradation of oxalate ingested.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This trial was the largest randomized controlled trial ever conducted in hyperoxaluria and key elements served as the blueprint for our pivotal Phase 3 program. Although the trial did not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint, we observed substantial reductions in UOx excretion in several key pre-specified secondary endpoints, particularly in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. Moreover, due to observed variability in UOx excretion, we believe that an analytical approach based upon TWA most appropriately indicates the therapeutic effect of reloxaliase in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. As a result, we chose as the primary endpoint of URIROX-1 the percent change from baseline in 24 hour UOx excretion averaged during Weeks 1-4 of the four-week treatment period. In addition, we observed reloxaliase to be well tolerated and highly specific to oxalate.
 Study 396-Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with Secondary Hyperoxaluria 
 We conducted a proof of concept clinical trial in patients with secondary hyperoxaluria. This trial was a multi-center, open-label, single arm trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of reloxaliase treatment in 16 patients with secondary hyperoxaluria and kidney stones, many of whom were receiving treatment in kidney stone clinics to manage kidney stone disease (e.g. low oxalate diet and high oral fluid intake, thiazide diuretics and potassium citrate). In the trial, all subjects were treated with a 7,500 unit oral dose of reloxaliase three times per day with meals for four days.
 Key results from this Phase 2 clinical trial included:
  
• | Subjects had an average reduction in UOx excretion of -13.92 mg/24 hour (p = 0.0084). The five subjects with enteric hyperoxaluria experienced a substantially greater average reduction in UOx excretion of -22.01 mg/24 hour as illustrated by the chart below.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Overall, 11 of 16 subjects, or 69%, had some reduction in UOx excretion levels, in whom the mean reduction was 23%.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17


 
• | The reduction in 24 hour UOx excretion was correlated with baseline UOx, demonstrating that subjects with higher UOx excretion levels at baseline showed greater reduction in UOx levels after taking reloxaliase, as shown in the figure below.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The trial demonstrated reloxaliase to be well tolerated. No deaths, SAEs, or other significant adverse events occurred in this trial. No subject was withdrawn from the study due to an adverse event. There were no clinically significant hematology or serum biochemistry abnormal values reported during the trial.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Study 649-Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Patients with Secondary Hyperoxaluria 
 We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with an adaptive design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three different doses of reloxaliase compared with placebo, administered for seven days, in subjects with kidney stones and secondary hyperoxaluria. Subjects were randomized to treatment sequences in a crossover fashion. A crossover trial is a longitudinal study in which subjects receive a sequence of different treatment arms during the course of the trial. Each treatment sequence consisted of two seven-day treatment periods separated by a seven-day washout period. Throughout the trial, each subject participated in two of the four treatment arms, which included a 1,500 unit oral dose of reloxaliase, a 3,000 unit oral dose of reloxaliase, a 7,500 unit oral dose of reloxaliase or placebo, with meals three times a day. A total of 32 subjects were randomized; two subjects were not treated, resulting in a total of 30 subjects included in the analyses. 
 Randomization in the reloxaliase low and mid-dose groups was halted after the first Adaptive Design Review Committee review of data on the first 12 subjects, resulting in only a small number of subjects in those two groups. The trial stopped enrolling in July 2016 following the second planned interim analysis once 24 subjects’ data were available, due to the inability to differentiate among the treatment arms. 
 A post-hoc evaluation of the data was conducted to attempt to determine factors which may have influenced the inability of reloxaliase to demonstrate a statistically significant difference from placebo. While no clear factor was identified to account for the lack of differentiation between reloxaliase and placebo, we believe the lack of effect may have been due to variability in dietary oxalate ingestion, measurement of UOx excretion and the complexities inherent in the short-cycle, crossover study design. 
 All three doses of reloxaliase were well tolerated in this study. No deaths, SAEs, or other significant AEs occurred. One subject who received the 1,500 unit oral dose of reloxaliase per meal three times per day experienced an SAE after the seven-day washout period during the first dosing day of reloxaliase at the 7,500 unit oral dose that led to withdrawal from the trial. The event was considered not related to study drug by the investigator. No other subjects withdrew due to a TEAE during the trial.

Pivotal Phase 3 URIROX Program and Regulatory Pathway
Our pivotal Phase 3 program for reloxaliase consists of two global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety of reloxaliase in adult patients with enteric hyperoxaluria and UOx ≥ 50 mg/24 hours, called URIROX-1 (formerly Study 301) and URIROX-2 (formerly Study 302). We expect that both trials will be conducted in the United States, Canada and Europe, and, in the case of URIROX-2, potentially other geographies. 
 We initiated URIROX-1 in March 2018. A total of 124 subjects are planned for randomization equally into two arms for a four-week treatment period. Subjects will self-administer either 284 mg (equivalent to 7,500 units) of reloxaliase or placebo with each meal or snack, up to five times per day, consistent with the eating patterns of patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. URIROX-1 has the same primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints as URIROX-2.  The primary endpoint for the study is the percent change from baseline in 24-hour urinary oxalate, or UOx, excretion during Weeks 1-4, comparing reduction in the average UOx excretion across Weeks 1-4 with reloxaliase to placebo. Secondary endpoints include proportion of subjects with a ≥20% reduction from baseline in 24-hour UOx excretion averaged during Weeks 1-4. URIROX-1 is the largest randomized, controlled trial of a novel therapeutic ever initiated in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. We expect to announce topline data from the URIROX-1 trial in the second half of 2019. 
 We initiated URIROX-2 in the fourth quarter of 2018. URIROX-2 is a multicenter, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of reloxaliase in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria, over a minimum treatment period of two years. The trial is designed to enroll 400 patients with 24-hour UOx excretion greater than or equal to 50 mg and a history of kidney stones, and will include patients with normal kidney function as well as chronic kidney disease (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than or equal to 30). Patients will be randomized 1:1 to reloxaliase vs. placebo and will take 284 mg (equivalent to 7,500 units) of reloxaliase or placebo with each meal or snack up to five times per day, consistent with the eating patterns of patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. 
 The primary efficacy endpoint for URIROX-2 is the percent change from baseline in 24-hour UOx excretion during Weeks 1-4, comparing mean reduction in the average UOx excretion across Weeks 1-4 with reloxaliase to placebo. Secondary endpoints include the proportion of subjects with a ≥20% reduction from baseline in 24-hour UOx excretion measured during Weeks 1-4 and percent change from baseline in 24-hour UOx excretion during Weeks 16 to 24. The primary long-term efficacy endpoint to confirm clinical benefit is the proportion of subjects with kidney stone disease progression, defined as a composite of either symptomatic kidney stone(s) or finding of new or enlarged kidney stone(s) using imaging, over a minimum treatment period of two years. Secondary long-term efficacy endpoints to confirm clinical benefit include change in eGFR from baseline and emergency room visits, hospitalizations or procedures for the management of kidney stones.  
 The FDA has advised us that they agree with our overall strategy to obtain accelerated approval for reloxaliase.  The data generated from the URIROX-1 and URIROX-2 trials could thus potentially form the basis of an accelerated approval of reloxaliase using reduction in UOx as a surrogate endpoint, with the final results from the URIROX-2 trial used to confirm clinical benefit post-approval.  We expect that our data package for accelerated approval would include a conditional power estimate based on the effect of reloxaliase on reducing kidney stone disease progression as assessed with interim data from the URIROX-2 trial, the effects of reloxaliase on reduction of UOx in the URIROX-1 and URIROX-2 trials, and further support for the model relating UOx levels to kidney stone disease progression, including but not limited to available data obtained in the URIROX-2 trial.  We expect to submit a BLA to the FDA after 400 patients have been randomized and followed for six months. For the long-term follow-up phase of the trial, subjects would continue in the study for a minimum treatment period of two years to confirm clinical benefit post-approval.
 The FDA has also advised us that part of its assessment of the adequacy of the URIROX-2 trial to support accelerated approval will be both the size of the effect seen on UOx in this trial and on our ability to support the model of the relationship between UOx levels and stone formation rates, which model can be informed by data generated in the URIROX-2 trial as well as other data sources.  This approach is consistent with the FDA’s published guidance on the accelerated approval pathway, which provides that clinical data from a single clinical trial can be used to both support accelerated approval and verify the clinical benefit.  This guidance stipulates that the protocol and statistical analysis plan should clearly account for an analysis of the surrogate endpoint data to provide support for accelerated approval, with continuation of the randomized trial(s) to obtain data on the clinical endpoint that will be the basis for verifying the clinical benefit.  In light of this guidance, URIROX-2 incorporates adaptive design elements that, through sample size re-estimations, will, if necessary, allow for increases in sample size and duration of treatment, based on accrued kidney stone disease progression rates and the conditional probability of achieving ultimate success in the long-term follow-up phase of the trial as reviewed by the FDA.  Based on the outcome of our planned sample size re-estimations we may be required to increase the number of patients treated and/or extend the follow-up period before we are able to submit a BLA for reloxaliase using the accelerated approval pathway.

For a discussion about the risks related to our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Drug Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization,” including, but not limited to, the specific risk factor titled “Although we have reached alignment with the FDA on the design of URIROX-2, our second pivotal Phase 3 trial of reloxaliase in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria, and our strategy to pursue a BLA submission for reloxaliase using the accelerated approval regulatory pathway, the clinical data we generate from our Phase 3 clinical program and/or the data we derive from third party datasets may not be sufficient to satisfy the FDA that we are eligible to use the accelerated approval regulatory pathway…”
In addition, we have conducted Scientific Advice meetings with regulatory authorities in three countries within the European Union, and discussed the results of our Phase 2 clinical program, our proposed pivotal Phase 3 program as described above and potential pathways for regulatory approval of reloxaliase in Europe. Subject to future anticipated interactions with the European Medical Agency (EMA), we believe that our proposed Phase 3 program, if successful, could support the filing of a future MAA application in the European Union via the conditional approval pathway, which is similar to the FDA’s accelerated approval pathway. 
 Finally, the Kidney Health Initiative, or the KHI, a public-private partnership established in 2012 by the American Society of Nephrology in collaboration with stakeholders in the renal community, including the FDA, recently launched a project on oxalate disorders with the Oxalosis and Hyperoxaluria Foundation. The project, called “Identification of Appropriate Endpoints for Clinical Trials in Hyperoxaluria”, is led by John C. Lieske, M.D., FASN, of the Mayo Clinic. The Oxalosis and Hyperoxaluria Foundation is an organization dedicated to the awareness, understanding and treatment of hyperoxaluria and oxalosis for healthcare professionals, patients and their families. An anticipated output of the KHI project is a document that summarizes consensus recommendations regarding appropriate biochemical endpoints for clinical trials in hyperoxaluria. 
 Summary of Completed Phase 1 Clinical Trial-Study 183
We completed a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and provide initial proof of concept of activity of reloxaliase in healthy volunteers. We fed 33 healthy adult subjects an oxalate-rich diet in order to induce transient dietary hyperoxaluria. Each subject then received either a 7,500 unit oral dose of reloxaliase or placebo three times per day with meals for seven days while continuing on the oxalate-rich diet. The high-oxalate diet increased baseline UOx excretion per 24 hours from a mean of 27.2 mg/24 hour to a mean 80.8 mg/24 hour. reloxaliase demonstrated significantly reduced UOx excretion with a mean reduction of -11.54 mg/24 hour compared to placebo (p = 0.0002). The mean reduction in the 18 of 30 subjects, or 60%, defined as responders (i.e. those who had > 5 mg/24 hour reduction in UOx excretion) was -20 mg/24 hour. No deaths, SAEs, or other significant AEs occurred during this trial, and no differences in the pattern of TEAEs were observed while on reloxaliase or placebo.

We have completed a series of preclinical studies to assess the pharmacology and toxicology of reloxaliase. Based on the results from these studies, which demonstrated, among other things, that reloxaliase remains in the GI tract and is not detected for systemic absorptions, we believe the preclinical program for reloxaliase is substantially complete. 
Pharmacology Studies 
 We have conducted an extensive pharmacology program consisting of a total of nine rodent and pig studies of reloxaliase. Our pharmacology studies provided confirmation of our hypothesis that orally administered oxalate decarboxylase, the active enzyme in reloxaliase, can reduce or normalize UOx levels by degrading both endogenously produced and dietary oxalate in rodent and pig models of hyperoxaluria and kidney damage. The pharmacology program for reloxaliase includes five studies in rodent models of primary and enteric hyperoxaluria (e.g. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or RYGB bariatric surgery) and four in pig dietary models of severe and enteric hyperoxaluria, designed to mimic these disorders in humans. Results of these preclinical studies demonstrated that reloxaliase was well tolerated and reduced or normalized UOx excretion in a dose-dependent manner in all forms of hyperoxaluria. 
 The initial pharmacology studies were completed in rodent models of primary hyperoxaluria (e.g. genetic model) and enteric hyperoxaluria (e.g. genetic and surgical models). In the primary hyperoxaluria mouse model, oxalate decarboxylase, the active enzyme in reloxaliase, was shown to be capable of acting on endogenously produced oxalate and to reduce urinary oxalate levels in a dose-dependent manner, preventing nephrocalcinosis, maintaining creatinine clearance (an important measure of kidney function) and increasing survival. In the RYGB rat model, oxalate decarboxylase reduced urine oxalate in a dose dependent manner and normalized UOx excretion. 
 20


Based on the results from testing oxalate decarboxylase in the rodent models, we and our scientific collaborators developed a pig model of hyperoxaluria to further assess the therapeutic and tolerability effects of different doses and formulations of reloxaliase, all in an effort to inform and de-risk our clinical development program in patients with hyperoxaluria. These studies were conducted in pig models of hyperoxaluria since, at the functional level, humans and pigs share many similarities with regard to kidneys, the urinary tract and the GI tract. The pig studies demonstrated that reloxaliase, administered orally with meals, reduced UOx excretion by degrading oxalate in the GI tract. Treatment was well tolerated, and resulted in mean reduction in UOx of between 12-30% relative to the control group. We observed the reduction in UOx excretion to be correlated with the severity of hyperoxaluria and treatment dose. More specifically, in a pig model where severe hyperoxaluria and hyperoxalemia were induced with an infusion of potassium oxalate salt, reloxaliase reduced hyperoxalemia and prevented further impairment of kidney function. Finally, in a pig model where chronic dietary hyperoxaluria was induced by a human-like high oxalate diet, resulting in an above-normal increase in plasma oxalate levels, we observed that therapy with reloxaliase normalized both plasma and urinary oxalate levels as illustrated in the figure below.
 

Taken together, these studies support the potential efficacy and mechanistic rationale of reloxaliase as a novel and thus far well-tolerated treatment for reducing hyperoxaluria, hyperoxalemia, and progressive nephrocalcinosis and CKD in patients with either primary or secondary hyperoxaluria. They provide in vivo mechanistic confirmation that supports our proposed pivotal Phase 3 clinical program in adults with enteric hyperoxaluria and our Phase 2 clinical trial in adolescents and adults with primary hyperoxaluria or enteric hyperoxaluria who also have hyperoxalemia, both of which can lead to systemic oxalosis. In addition, these preclinical studies were submitted as scientific evidence to demonstrate the proof of concept for reloxaliase as a treatment for primary hyperoxaluria, which led to the orphan drug designations for reloxaliase for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria by the FDA and the European Commission.
 Toxicology Studies 
 To support our clinical development program of reloxaliase, we conducted a total of six toxicity studies in rats and dogs. These studies demonstrated that reloxaliase was well tolerated in animals. We conducted our first two studies which demonstrated that oral administration of reloxaliase for 14 days was well tolerated in animals at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (which corresponds to 2,000 units/kg/day). We also performed an additional 2-week repeated dose toxicology study of reloxaliase in rats at doses up to 4,860 units/kg/day, approximately 13 times the dose used in our Phase 1 clinical trial of reloxaliase, for a 60 kg subject. 
 To support clinical trials of longer duration, we conducted two 28-day repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs. These studies demonstrated that twice-daily oral administration of reloxaliase was well tolerated for 28 consecutive days at 520 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL, or no-observed-adverse-effect-level, or highest concentration of drug which caused no detectable adverse effect, was 7,000 units/kg/day in both species. This concentration was approximately 18 times the highest dose used in Study 713, our 28-day Phase 2 clinical trial, for a 60 kg subject. 
 We have also completed a six month chronic toxicology study of reloxaliase in rats. It demonstrated that twice-daily oral administration of reloxaliase was well tolerated for 26 consecutive weeks at 520 mg/kg/day (6,618 units/kg/day) with the NOAEL approximately 11 times greater for a 60 kg subject than we expect to use in our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program. In each study, the NOAEL was the highest dose evaluated in that particular study. 
 21


Based on the results from these studies, which demonstrated, among other things, that reloxaliase is not systemically absorbed, and feedback from the FDA, we believe the preclinical program for reloxaliase is substantially complete, and no carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or reproductive toxicity studies are planned. 
 In connection with our preparations for our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program, we considered the best mechanism to study the potential for drug-drug interactions in patients treated with reloxaliase and also the potential effects of formate generation resulting from reloxaliase’s degradation of oxalate. Based on feedback from the FDA, we [conducted] an in vitro assessment to evaluate the potential for systemic drug interactions. Based on extensive scientific evidence, we believe that the level of formate generation derived from reloxaliase and oxalate is below limits generally regarded as safe. We plan to test this in humans in Study 206, as these patients have an established heavy systemic burden on oxalate and would be expected to generate formate based on reloxaliase’s mechanism of action. The nature of additional studies, if any, will be determined by the results of these initial investigations. 
 Summary of Phase 2 Clinical Program for Reloxaliase in Primary and Severe Hyperoxaluria
Our preclinical pharmacology studies in models of primary hyperoxaluria have demonstrated that reloxaliase significantly reduced oxalate levels in the urine and plasma. The FDA has granted separate orphan drug designations for reloxaliase for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria and for the treatment of pediatric hyperoxaluria. In addition, the European Commission has granted orphan designation for reloxaliase for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria. In light of these designations, we initiated an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial (Study 206) in March 2018 in adolescents and adults with primary hyperoxaluria or enteric hyperoxaluria, who also have elevated levels of oxalate in the blood, or hyperoxalemia, which can lead to systemic oxalosis, a potentially fatal disorder associated with deposition of oxalate in tissues.  We expect to announce initial data from Study 206 in the second quarter of 2019 and topline data in the second half of 2019.
 Systemic oxalosis refers to the presence of excess oxalate throughout the body, including the bones, joints, eyes and heart, which occurs when the kidney fails to excrete oxalate from the body, leading to elevated oxalate levels in the blood and deposition in the tissues. Our Phase 2 clinical trial utilizes an open-label basket trial design with a 12-week treatment period and will enroll subsets of patients suffering from complications of severe hyperoxaluria, including adults and adolescents with primary hyperoxaluria or enteric hyperoxaluria who also have hyperoxalemia. More specifically, we plan to enroll subjects >12 years of age with primary or enteric hyperoxaluria, approximately 50% each, screened for baseline UOx excretion greater than 40 mg/24 hr and plasma oxalate levels greater than 5 µmol/L. Since these patients typically have varying degrees of renal impairment, such as CKD, dialysis subjects will be allowed, but limited to approximately 25% of total enrollment as extensive tissue oxalate deposition may obscure a potential signal of lowering plasma oxalate levels. The endpoints for this study include change from baseline in plasma oxalate and 24-hour UOx excretion. A peer-reviewed study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1994 demonstrated that treatment with orthophosphate and Vitamin B6 in a subset of patients with primary hyperoxaluria reduced UOx excretion by approximately 10% annually over 10 years, which showed preservation of renal function in these patients. In light of this data, we believe that the ability of reloxaliase to degrade oxalate in the GI tract to prevent systemic oxalate absorption and therefore decrease the renal oxalate burden is well suited for testing in these patient populations. If reloxaliase can reduce urine and plasma oxalate levels in these patients, it may be able to diminish the amount of systemic oxalate available for calcium oxalate crystal formation and deposition in the kidney and other organs or tissues.
 Other Potential Indications for Reloxaliase-Idiopathic Hyperoxaluria
We believe the mechanism of action of reloxaliase, which is designed to degrade oxalate in the GI tract, is particularly well-targeted to treat enteric hyperoxaluria where excess oxalate absorption is driven by an underlying GI disorder. While hyperabsorption of oxalate is typically a characteristic of enteric hyperoxaluria, we believe there is a subgroup of patients with idiopathic hyperoxaluria that hyperabsorbs oxalate from their diets at levels similar to those patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. We confirmed these pathophysiological traits in both enteric and idiopathic patients in a prospective controlled clinical trial designed to identify patients who hyperabsorb oxalate (Study 204) in 22 patients with secondary hyperoxaluria, with no study drug administration. Although subjects with enteric hyperoxaluria had greater average oxalate absorption than the subjects with idiopathic hyperoxaluria, approximately 40% of the subjects with idiopathic hyperoxaluria approached absorption levels observed in subjects with enteric disorders. Consequently, although we are initially targeting reloxaliase for patients with enteric hyperoxaluria, we believe the product candidate holds promise in treating the subset of patients with idiopathic hyperoxaluria who hyperabsorb oxalate. 
 ALLN-346
 Overview of Hyperuricemia & Gout 
 Hyperuricemia, or elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, results from overproduction or insufficient excretion of urate, or often a combination of the two. Humans lack urate oxidase, an enzyme that degrades uric acid in a wide range of other 
 22


organisms, including animals, plants, bacteria and fungi. Hyperuricemia can be a predisposing condition for gout and kidney stones, and is also intricately linked with various metabolic disorders, including hypertension, CKD, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and obesity. Hyperuricemia may also be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. 
 Gout is a kind of arthritis caused by excess uric acid in the blood. When uric acid levels in the blood are too high, hard crystals may form in the joints, causing attacks of sudden burning pain, stiffness, and swelling. These attacks can happen over and over unless gout is treated. Over time, they can harm joints, tendons, and other tissues. 
 Current Therapeutic Options and Their Limitations 
 We engaged a healthcare strategy consulting firm who estimated the gout market for urate lowering therapies to be approximately $1 billion in the U.S. and concluded that it was incompletely served by existing therapies. Several of the current drugs approved for gout raise concerns over lack of efficacy or increased toxicity in patients with reduced kidney function. There are approximately 850,000 hyperuricemia patients with moderate to severe CKD on urate lowering therapy of which approximately 375,000 have uncontrolled gout. Hyperuricemic and gout patients with renal impairment are more challenging to manage due to limitations of existing therapies. These limitations include poor tolerability, reduced efficacy, dose restriction and contraindications. Co-morbidities (e.g. cardiovascular disease) are common in this patient population and may also limit urate lowering therapeutic options. Accordingly, there is a significant unmet need for a safe and effective therapy that can be used in patients with renal impairment. 
Our Solution 
 We have designed our second product candidate, ALLN-346, an orally administered, novel, urate degrading enzyme, for patients with hyperuricemia and gout in the setting of CKD. Hyperuricemia, or elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, results from overproduction or insufficient excretion of urate, or often a combination of the two. Humans lack urate oxidase, an enzyme that degrades uric acid in a wide range of other organisms, including animals, plants, bacteria and fungi. Hyperuricemia is associated with gout, a kind of arthritis caused by excess uric acid in the blood that leads to the formation of hard crystals in the joints. Hyperuricemia can also lead to increased uric acid excretion in the urine and subsequently to kidney stone formation and kidney damage, also known as urate nephropathy. In addition, hyperuricemia has been linked to hypertension, CKD, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and obesity.
 We engineered ALLN-346 to degrade urate in the GI tract and, in turn, reduce the urate burden on the kidney and lower the risk of urate-related complications. ALLN-346 is targeted to lower serum uric acid in patients with CKD, who have decreased renal function and diminished capacity for urinary excretion of uric acid. Patients with renal impairment who have hyperuricemia and gout are often not optimally managed due to limitations of available therapies, including decreased tolerability, dose restrictions, drug-drug interactions and contraindications. An estimated 375,000 patients in the United States have refractory gout and CKD. We presented data from an animal proof-of-concept study at the American College of Rheumatology meeting in October 2018. The poster presentation from this meeting includes data demonstrating urate reduction in a urate oxidase knock-out mouse model, an animal model of severe hyperuricemia with kidney damage due to urate crystal deposition. After one week of treatment, mice treated with ALLN-346 achieved a substantial reduction in urate burden on the kidney, as evidence by normalization in urine uric acid, and a significant reduction in plasma urate.    
Our Proprietary Technological Approach 
 Expertise in Enzyme Technology 
 We believe our proprietary know-how in enzyme technology allows for the design, development, formulation, and scalable manufacturing of non-absorbed and stable enzymes delivered orally and in sufficient doses for activity in the GI tract. This approach enables us to develop enzyme therapies that degrade metabolites within the GI tract, which reduces potentially toxic metabolite levels in the blood and urine, and in turn, diminishes the disease burden on the kidney over time. The general therapeutic approach of deploying a non-absorbed drug into the GI tract to reduce metabolic disease burden in patients with kidney disease has been proven successful in several therapeutic categories. Utilizing our proprietary technological approach, we conceived and are developing our first two product candidates, reloxaliase and ALLN-346, which are novel, oral enzyme therapeutics for the treatment of hyperoxaluria and hyperuricemia. Our proprietary and scalable manufacturing capabilities have enabled us to produce large quantities of reloxaliase sufficiently to support our clinical and commercial strategy, with costs anticipated to be comparable to small molecule therapeutics.
 One of the technologies that we use in our lead product candidate, reloxaliase, is protein crystallization, which stabilizes a highly active form of the oxalate degrading enzyme, oxalate decarboxylase, ensuring effective transit through the GI tract, as well as stabilization at room temperature for convenient storage. Crystallized enzymes are more stable, pure and concentrated than enzymes in solution. For example, one enzyme crystal may contain several billion molecules of the underlying enzyme. 
 23


These characteristics improve storage and delivery, permitting delivery of the enzyme molecules with fewer capsules. Once an enzyme is in the crystallized state, we can formulate it for oral delivery. Within the GI tract, the crystalized enzyme is stable and protected from proteolytic degradation, yet sufficiently porous for metabolites to pass through and be degraded by the enzyme. The general therapeutic approach of deploying a non-absorbed drug into the GI tract to reduce metabolic disease burden in patients with kidney disease has been proven successful in several therapeutic categories. For example, Renagel and Renvela, marketed by Sanofi, remove excess levels of phosphate in the body in patients with CKD by delivering drug to the GI tract, where it binds to phosphate and removes it from the body through the bowel. 
 Our knowledge base from reloxaliase provides us with a useful template for our other research and preclinical programs that rely on the same fundamental science and therapeutic strategy. We anticipate that our second product candidate, ALLN-346, a first-in-class uricase enzyme, will utilize several proprietary technologies to ensure its stabilization in the GI tract as well as other attractive manufacturing, clinical and commercial attributes similar to reloxaliase.
 Manufacturing 
 Reloxaliase is an oral, solid dosage form of crystalline recombinant oxalate decarboxylase enzyme that is produced using a combination of traditional and novel manufacturing processes. The methods of production for reloxaliase have been carefully selected for cost-effectiveness and ease of scaling. We believe our manufacturing technology enables us to produce large quantities of our oral enzyme product candidates, sufficiently to support our clinical and commercial strategy, with costs anticipated to be comparable to small molecule therapeutics. Working in collaboration with top-tier development and manufacturing companies, we have completed several successive scale-ups to the manufacturing process in support of increasing clinical trial demand and in planning for commercialization. 
 Manufacturing biologic drugs is generally a complex and cost intensive process because they are manufactured in living systems or cells and tend to be large complex molecules. Since the living systems used to produce biologics can be sensitive to minor changes in manufacturing techniques, small process differences can significantly affect the nature of the finished biologic and, most importantly, the way it functions in the body.
 Production of reloxaliase occurs utilizing scientifically developed know-how, delivering high productivity from host bacterial cells. The entire biomass is harvested and processed through primary recovery and downstream purification unit operations, resulting in the recovery of large quantities of oxalate decarboxylase. The purified and concentrated product is crystallized, dried into a protein powder and formulated for production as an oral capsule. The oral capsule presentation has attractive properties of pharmaceutical activity and stability suitable for further development and ultimate commercial use. Over the course of our development of reloxaliase, we have been able to increase enzyme yield and activity through improvements to our manufacturing processes, thereby reducing the pill burden of our therapeutic candidate. As a result, the dosing regimen for our pivotal Phase 3 program will be two capsules per dosing compared to five capsules per dosing in our Phase 2 clinical program. 
 Drug product production starts with dried oxalate decarboxylase crystals, then uses tailored pharmaceutical techniques to blend, densify and encapsulate the product candidate, which is an oral, solid-dose formulation of the crystallized enzyme. We have secured development and supply agreements with premiere global drug product contract manufacturing organizations suited to meet the needs of commercialization for reloxaliase. Finally, we forecast cost of goods sold for reloxaliase to be comparable to traditional oral small molecules over the course of its commercialization life cycle. 
 Commercialization Strategy 
 We hold worldwide commercialization and development rights to all of our first-in-class, oral, non-absorbed enzyme therapeutic product candidates. The FDA has granted separate orphan drug designations for our lead product candidate, reloxaliase, for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria and for the treatment pediatric hyperoxaluria (primary and secondary hyperoxaluria). In addition, the European Commission has granted orphan designation for reloxaliase for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria. 
 Reloxaliase, if approved, has the potential to be the first therapeutic option for patients with severe hyperoxaluria. We intend to independently pursue regulatory approval of reloxaliase in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria in the United States and, if approved, to commercialize the product by building a focused commercial organization in the United States specifically to target nephrologists and urologists who treat patients with hyperoxaluria, particularly at kidney stone clinics. In addition, we plan to build a marketing organization that will conceive and implement marketing strategies for any product that we directly commercialize. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing commercialization initiatives for each approved product and establishing and maintaining relationships with researchers, practitioners and key opinion leaders for rare and severe metabolic and kidney disorders. 
 24


Outside of the United States, we intend to explore collaborations to commercialize our product candidates, including reloxaliase. Depending on our evaluation of these market opportunities and the strategic merits of these collaboration opportunities, we may decide to retain commercial rights in key markets. 
 Competition 
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change as researchers learn more about diseases and develop new technologies and treatments. Our potential competitors include primarily large pharmaceutical, biotechnology companies and specialty pharmaceutical companies. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of reloxaliase, ALLN-346 and any other product candidates we may develop are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of administration, price and reimbursement. 
 There is no approved pharmacologic therapy for the reduction of urinary oxalate excretion in patients with hyperoxaluria, either primary or secondary. Existing treatment options for hyperoxaluria generally are non-specific and include high fluid intake to increase urine output to more than two to three liters per day, a diet low in salt and oxalate, oral citrate and/or calcium and/or magnesium supplementation and orthophosphate and Vitamin B6, exclusively for the specific subset of responsive patients with the most severe form of primary hyperoxaluria (PH1). 
 We are aware of other companies pursuing oxalate reduction in both primary and secondary hyperoxaluria. For example, Alnylam is conducting an ongoing pivotal Phase 3 study under the Accelerated Approval pathway for the treatment of patients with primary hyperoxaluria Type 1. Dicerna is conducting ongoing clinical development for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria Types 1-3. Oxthera AB (Sweden) and Captozyme (U.S.) are developing orally delivered products to degrade oxalate in the stomach and GI tract. Oxthera is conducting Phase 3 clinical trials for Oxabact, Oxalobacter formigenes, indicated for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria.
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. `
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to compositions, methods of treatment, dosage forms, and dosage regimens that we identify during the course of our business. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and patent scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any or our issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors. Any of our patents may be challenged, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties. 
 Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, to determine priority of invention. 
 Patents 
 As of March 1, 2019, we own or have rights in 5 issued U.S. patents, 18 issued foreign patents, 6 pending U.S. patent applications, and 6 pending foreign patent applications.
 25


With regard to reloxaliase, we have exclusively licensed from Althea Technologies, Inc. (now known as Ajinomoto Althea, Inc.), or Althea, one issued U.S. patent with method of use claims directed to the reduction of oxalate in a mammal by orally administering a composition containing uncrosslinked oxalate decarboxylase crystals, which is scheduled to expire in 2027, without taking a potential patent term extension into account. This U.S. patent belongs to a family of patents that includes a granted Canadian patent and a granted European patent, which has been validated in a number of countries including Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK; and a patent application pending in China. This patent family also includes a U.S. patent with method of use claims directed to a method of reducing oxalate with oxalate decarboxylase crystals in an extracorporeal device, which is scheduled to expire in 2027, without taking a potential patent term extension into account. 
 In addition, we own two U.S. patents One with composition of matter claims directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising biologically active uncrosslinked oxalate decarboxylase crystals, which is scheduled to expire in 2027, without taking a patent term extension into account; and another with composition of matter claims directed to a capsule containing crystals of spray-dried oxalate decarboxylase and method of use claims directed to a method of reducing oxalate in a mammal suffering from a disorder, e.g., primary hyperoxaluria and enteric hyperoxaluria, using such a capsule, which is scheduled to expire in 2034, without taking a potential patent term extension into account. 
 Another family of patent applications that we own are pending in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Israel and Japan with composition of matter claims directed to a composition comprising a peritoneal dialysis solution and uncrosslinked crystals of oxalate decarboxylase for use in reducing oxalate during a dialysis-based treatment, which, if granted, would be scheduled to expire in 2034, without taking a patent term extension into account. 
 With regard to ALLN-346, we own a U.S. provisional patent application with composition of matter claims directed to novel recombinant uricase enzymes and method of use claims directed to treating certain diseases associated with elevated levels of uric acid with such enzymes. A U.S. patent claiming the benefit of the provisional application, if issued, would be expected to expire in 2038, without taking a patent term extension into account. 
 In the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. For example, it is possible that an issued U.S. patent covering reloxaliase or its use may be entitled to a patent term extension. If reloxaliase receives FDA approval, we intend to apply for a patent term extension, if available, to extend the term of a patent that covers the approved product. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where they are available, however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secret protection for our proprietary information that is not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including, for example, certain aspects of our manufacturing procedures. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, including restricting access to our premises and our confidential information, as well as entering into agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and potential collaborators, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. 
 Althea License Agreement 
 In March 2012, we entered into a license agreement with Althea, as amended in March 2016, pursuant to which Althea granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under specified intellectual property rights relating to, among other things, oxalate decarboxylase and ALTU-237, now called reloxaliase, to develop, use, make, have made, market, offer to sell, sell, have sold, distribute, import or otherwise exploit licensed products. Althea expressly retains all rights under the licensed patents that are not granted to us under the agreement, which we refer to as Althea’s retained rights. We have the right to sublicense our licensed rights, provided that each sublicense agreement must be in writing and consistent with the terms of the license agreement. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the licensed products for the treatment of hyperoxaluria. 
 Under the license agreement, we reimbursed Althea for patent-related fees and costs totaling $0.1 million in the aggregate and have issued to Althea a total of 88,186 shares of our common stock. Althea is entitled to receive regulatory 
 26


milestone payments totaling up to $31.0 million in the aggregate. We are also obligated to make additional payments to Althea of up to an aggregate of $25.0 million based upon the occurrence of certain sales milestones. Althea is entitled to receive mid-single-digit percentage royalties on net sales of licensed products, made by us, our affiliates, or our sublicensees, subject to certain reductions for any royalty payments required to be made by us to acquire patent rights, however, such royalty payments cannot be reduced below an aggregate minimum floor. The milestone payments are not creditable against royalties. The royalty term will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire valid patent claim that covers the composition, manufacture, or use of such licensed product in such country, or the tenth anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. 
 We have the first right, but not the obligation, to prosecute, defend, maintain and enforce certain product-specific patent rights licensed under the agreement, and Althea has the exclusive right to prosecute, defend, maintain and enforce all other licensed patent rights. If we are controlling any lawsuits regarding the licensed patents, we cannot enter into a settlement without the prior written consent of Althea. Any sums recovered in such lawsuits will be shared between us and Althea. Unless terminated earlier, the term of the license agreement will expire on date of the last-to-expire royalty term. We have the right to terminate the agreement for convenience upon 60 days prior written notice to Althea. Either party may terminate the agreement after a 60-day notice period in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. If we terminate the agreement for convenience or if Althea terminates the agreement for cause, we grant Althea a right of first negotiation, exercisable for the 30-day period after such termination, to obtain an exclusive license to certain patent rights and data controlled by us that are related to the licensed products and to have all investigational new drug applications, or INDs (other than the IND for reloxaliase), transferred to Althea. 
 In addition, pursuant to a letter agreement we entered into with Althea in June 2017, and subject to a fully paid-up exclusive worldwide license that we grant to Althea with respect to Althea’s retained rights, Althea assigned certain U.S. patent rights to us. We agreed to continue to comply with our obligations under the license agreement, including our obligation to make milestone and royalty payments to Althea. Upon any termination or expiration of the license agreement, we are obligated to assign such patent rights back to Althea. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products, including biological products. In addition, some jurisdictions regulate the pricing of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 Licensure and Regulation of Biologics in the United States 
 In the United States, our candidate products are regulated as biological products, or biologics, under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and their implementing regulations. The failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, including nonclinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process or post-approval process, may subject an applicant to delays in the conduct of a study, regulatory review and approval, and/or administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions may include, but are not limited to, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s, or FDA’s, refusal to allow an applicant to proceed with clinical testing, refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning or untitled letters, adverse publicity, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, and civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA or the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities. 
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new biologic in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps:

Nonclinical Studies and Investigational New Drug Application 
 Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo nonclinical testing. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to evaluate the potential for efficacy and toxicity. The conduct of the nonclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the product or conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before the clinical trial can begin.
 As a result, submission of the IND may result in the FDA not allowing the trial to commence or allowing the trial to commence on the terms originally specified by the sponsor in the IND. If the FDA raises concerns or questions either during this initial 30-day period, or at any time during the IND process, it may choose to impose a partial or complete clinical hold. A complete clinical hold issued by the FDA would delay either a proposed clinical study or cause suspension of an ongoing study, until all outstanding concerns have been adequately addressed and the FDA has notified the company that investigation may proceed. This could cause significant delays or difficulties in completing planned clinical trials in a timely manner. A partial clinical hold places restrictions on a clinical trial, such as limiting the doses administered or the duration of the trial. The FDA may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. 
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of a BLA 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients with the disease to be treated under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator in accordance with GCP requirements. Clinical trials are conducted under study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of the BLA so long as the clinical trial is well-designed and well-conducted in 
 28


accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, and the FDA is able to validate the study data through an onsite inspection, if necessary. 
 Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board, or IRB, either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, clinical trial design, patient informed consent, ethical factors, and the safety of human subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. The FDA, IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP rules and the requirements for informed consent. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group may recommend continuation of the study as planned, changes in study conduct, or cessation of the study at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. Information about certain clinical studies must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
 Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may be required after approval. 
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy, and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a biologic; such Phase 3 studies are referred to as “pivotal.”
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may approve a BLA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of biologics approved under accelerated approval regulations. If the FDA approves a product while a company has ongoing clinical trials that were not necessary for approval, a company may be able to use the data from these clinical trials to meet all or part of any Phase 4 clinical trial requirement or to request a change in the product labeling. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products. 
 Compliance with cGMP Requirements 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in full compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products like biologics whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. 
 Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of products must also register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Any product manufactured by or imported from a facility that has not registered, whether foreign or domestic, is deemed misbranded under the FDCA. Establishments may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Manufacturers may have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated. 
 29


Review and Approval of a BLA 
 The results of product candidate development, nonclinical testing, and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting license to market the product. The BLA must contain extensive manufacturing information and detailed information on the composition of the product and proposed labeling as well as payment of a user fee. 
 The FDA has 60 days after submission of the application to conduct an initial review to determine whether it is sufficient to accept for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the application. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or the PDUFA, the FDA has ten months in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority review of the application. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs. The review process may often be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or if the applicant otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 Under the PHSA, the FDA may approve a BLA if it determines that the product is safe, pure, and potent and the facility where the product will be manufactured meets standards designed to ensure that it continues to be safe, pure, and potent. 
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities and any FDA audits of nonclinical and clinical study sites to assure compliance with GLPs and GCPs, respectively, the FDA may issue an approval letter, denial letter, or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. If the application is not approved, the FDA may issue a complete response letter, which will contain the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application, and when possible will outline recommended actions the sponsor might take to obtain approval of the application. Sponsors that receive a complete response letter may submit to the FDA information that represents a complete response to the issues identified by the FDA. Such resubmissions are classified under PDUFA as either Class 1 or Class 2. The classification of a resubmission is based on the information submitted by an applicant in response to an action letter. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has two months to review a Class 1 resubmission and six months to review a Class 2 resubmission. The FDA will not approve an application until issues identified in the complete response letter have been addressed. If an applicant does not resubmit the BLA in response to a complete response letter, the applicant may withdraw the original application or request an opportunity for a hearing. The FDA issues a denial letter if it determines that the establishment or product does not meet the agency’s requirements. 
 The FDA may also refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. In particular, the FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates, and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product. It may also require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may call for post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess the product’s safety after approval. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.

Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations 
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, and priority review designation. 
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Second, a product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case- by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 
 Accelerated Approval Pathway 
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product.
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or 
 31


decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
 The 21st Century Cures Act 
 The 21st Century Cures Act, which was signed into law in December 2016, requires the FDA to establish a process for the qualification of drug development tools that may be used to support or obtain licensure of a biological product or support of the investigational use of a biological product. A drug development tool includes a biomarker, a clinical outcome assessment, and any other method, material, or measure that the FDA determines aids drug development and regulatory review. A biomarker is a characteristic, such as a physiologic, pathologic, or anatomic characteristic or measurement, that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathologic processes, or biological responses to a therapeutic intervention and includes a surrogate endpoint. A clinical outcome assessment is a measurement of a patient’s symptoms, overall mental state, or the effects of a disease or condition on how the patient functions and includes a patient-reported outcome. 
 The 21st Century Cures Act also requires that, for approval of any BLAs submitted after June 12, 2017, the FDA shall make public a brief statement regarding the patient experience data and related information, if any, submitted and reviewed as part of the application. Patient experience data includes data that are collected by any persons, including patients, family members and caregivers of patients, patient advocacy organizations, disease research foundations, researchers and drug manufacturers, and are intended to provide information about patients’ experiences with a disease or condition, including the impact of such disease or condition, or a related therapy, on patients’ lives and patient preferences with respect to treatment of such disease or condition. 
 Post-Approval Regulation 
 If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any post-approval requirements that the FDA has imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements.
 A biologic product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official lot release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 32


 
• | fines, untitled letters or warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Pharmaceutical products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Orphan drug designation in the United States is designed to encourage sponsors to develop products intended for rare diseases or conditions. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the biologic for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation to reloxaliase for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria and pediatric hyperoxaluria. This includes both children with secondary hyperoxaluria, attributable to excess GI absorption of oxalate, as well as the rare condition primary hyperoxaluria, a genetic defect of one of several liver enzymes. 
 Orphan drug designation qualifies a company for tax credits and market exclusivity for seven years following the date of the product’s marketing approval if granted by the FDA. An application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. A product becomes an orphan when it receives orphan drug designation from the Office of Orphan Products Development, or OOPD, at the FDA based on acceptable confidential requests made under the regulatory provisions. The product must then go through the review and approval process like any other product.
 A sponsor may request orphan drug designation of a previously unapproved product or new orphan indication for an already marketed product. In addition, a sponsor of a product that is otherwise the same product as an already approved orphan drug may seek and obtain orphan drug designation for the subsequent product for the same rare disease or condition if it can present a plausible hypothesis that its product may be clinically superior to the first drug. More than one sponsor may receive orphan drug designation for the same product for the same rare disease or condition, but each sponsor seeking orphan drug designation must file a complete request for designation. 
 The period of exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by the FDA and applies only to the indication for which the product has been designated. The FDA may approve a second application for the same product for a different use or a second application for a clinically superior version of the product for the same use. The FDA cannot, however, approve the same product made by another manufacturer for the same indication during the market exclusivity period unless it has the consent of the sponsor or the sponsor is unable to provide sufficient quantities. 
 Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended, a BLA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data 
 33


requirements. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. 
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
 The Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law in March 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. To date, seventeen biosimilar products have been approved by the FDA for use in the United States. No interchangeable biosimilars, however, have been approved. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. 
 Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own nonclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
 A patent claiming a new biologic product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a marketing application, plus the time between the submission date of a marketing application and the ultimate approval date, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 
Regulation and Procedures Governing Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company also must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, 
 34


the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union, or EU, generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the EU. 
 Clinical Trial Approval 
 Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of an EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, or in multiple member states if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of member states. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the independent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application, or CTA, must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 
 In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. It is expected that the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will apply in 2019 with a three-year transition period. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new regulation, which will be directly applicable in all member states, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For instance, the new Clinical Trials Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications. 
 Marketing Authorization 
 To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under the EU regulatory system, an applicant must submit an MAA, either under a centralized procedure administered by the European Medicines Authority, or EMA, or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in EU Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure, or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, an applicant must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. 
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all EU member states. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. 
 Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the EMA is responsible for conducting an initial assessment of a product. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. 
 Regulatory Data Protection in the European Union 
 In the European Union, new chemical entities approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for a period of eight years. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed 
 35


until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, nonclinical tests and clinical trials. 
 Periods of Authorization and Renewals 
 A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed after five years on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To that end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. Any authorization that is not followed by the placement of the drug on the EU market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid. 
 Regulatory Requirements after Marketing Authorization 
 Following approval, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal product. These include compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. In addition, the manufacturing of authorized products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the EMA’s GMP requirements and comparable requirements of other regulatory bodies in the EU, which mandate the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity. Finally, the marketing and promotion of authorized products, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended. 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
 An orphan drug designation provides a number of benefits, including fee reductions, regulatory assistance, and the possibility to apply for a centralized EU marketing authorization. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA nor the European Commission or the member states can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for a “similar medicinal product.” A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation because, for example, the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. 
Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may seek regulatory approval by the FDA or other government authorities. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use any product candidates we may develop unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of such 
 36


product candidates. Even if any product candidates we may develop are approved, sales of such product candidates will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers, and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such product candidates. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover any product candidates we may develop could reduce physician utilization of such product candidates once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of pharmaceuticals have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to pursue new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Individual state legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing. Some of these measures include price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, measures designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for any product candidates we may develop will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of any product candidates we may develop to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. 
 In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessments, or HTAs) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. E.U. member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts 
 37


could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic, and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states), can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries. 
 Healthcare Law and Regulation 
 Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors, and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: 

• | the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things: knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent; making a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false of fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the anti-inducement law which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person know or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 38


 
• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. 
 By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential product candidates are: 
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for products that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable products to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient products to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 39


 
• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription product spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, that while not a law, is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the ACA. In May 2017, the House of Representatives passed legislation to repeal and replace parts of the ACA. To date, while Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing or delaying penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance, delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, and increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The Trump administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018 the same judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal. It is unclear how this decision and any subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. We continue to evaluate the effect that the Affordable Care Act and its possible repeal and replacement could have on our business.
 In addition, since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. One Executive Order directs federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The second Executive Order terminates the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Additionally, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws. For example, the ACA amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes to clarify that liability under these statutes does not require a person or entity to have actual knowledge of the statutes or a specific intent to violate them. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Furthermore, on January 31, 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) proposed an amendment to one of the existing Anti-Kickback safe harbors (42 C.F.R. 1001.952(h)) which would prohibit certain pharmaceutical manufacturers from offering rebates to pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”) in the Medicare Part D and Medicaid managed care programs. The proposed amendment would remove protection for "discounts" from Anti-Kickback enforcement action, and would include criminal and civil penalties for knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or reward the referral of business reimbursable under federal health care programs. At the same time, HHS also proposed to create a new safe harbor to protect point-of-sale discounts that drug manufacturers provide directly to patients, and adds another safe harbor to protect certain administrative fees paid by manufacturers to PBMs. If this proposal is adopted, in whole or in part, it could affect the pricing and reimbursement for any products for which we receive approval in the future.  Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory 
 40


exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.
 There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal, and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates. 
 Additional regulation 
 In addition to the foregoing, state, and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling, and disposal of various biologic, chemical, and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in third countries that impose similar obligations.
 Employees 
 As of March 1, 2019, we had 49 full-time employees, including 11 employees with Ph.D. or M.D. degrees. 40 of our employees are engaged in research and development activities and 9 are engaged in general and administrative activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Facilities 
 We occupy approximately 7,795 square feet of office space in Newton, MA under a lease that expires in December of 2020. In addition, we occupy approximately 7,564 square feet of office and laboratory space in Sudbury, MA under a lease that expires in February 2021. We do not own any real property. We believe that this office and laboratory space is sufficient to meet our current needs and that suitable additional space will be available as and when needed. 
Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. Our management believes that there are currently no claims or actions pending against us, the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
