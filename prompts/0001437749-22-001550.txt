Item 1. Business
 
H.B. Fuller Company was founded in 1887 and incorporated as a Minnesota corporation in 1915. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol FUL. As used herein, “H.B. Fuller”, “we”, “us”, “our”, “management” or “company” includes H.B. Fuller and its subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated. Where we refer to 2021, 2020 and 2019 herein, the reference is to our fiscal years ended November 27, 2021, November 28, 2020, and November 30, 2019, respectively.
 
We are a leading worldwide formulator, manufacturer and marketer of adhesives, sealants and other specialty chemical products. Sales operations span 35 countries in North America, Europe, Latin America, the Asia Pacific region, India, the Middle East and Africa. Industrial adhesives represent our core product offering. Customers use our adhesives products in manufacturing common consumer and industrial goods, including food and beverage containers, disposable diapers, medical products, windows, doors, flooring, roofing, appliances, sportswear, footwear, multi-wall bags, water filtration products, insulation, textiles, automobiles, recreational vehicles, buses, trucks and trailers, marine products, solar energy systems, electronics and products for the aerospace and defense industries. Our adhesives help improve the performance of our customers’ products or improve their manufacturing processes. We also provide our customers with technical support and unique solutions designed to address their specific needs. In addition, we have established a variety of product offerings for residential and commercial construction markets, such as tile-setting adhesives, grouts, sealants and related products.
 
We have three reportable segments: Hygiene, Health and Consumable Adhesives, Engineering Adhesives and Construction Adhesives. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (the “MD&A”) in Item 7 of this Annual Report for a description of our segment operating results.
 
Non-U.S. Operations
 
The principal markets, products and methods of distribution outside the United States vary with each of our regional operations generally maintaining integrated business units that contain dedicated supplier networks, manufacturing, logistics and sales organizations. The vast majority of the products sold within any region are produced within the region, and the respective regions do not import significant amounts of product from other regions. As of November 27, 2021, we had sales offices and manufacturing plants in 21 countries outside the United States and satellite sales offices in another 13 countries.
 
We have a Code of Business Conduct and detailed Core Policies that we apply across all of our operations around the world. These policies represent a set of common values that apply to all employees and all of our business dealings. We have adopted policies and processes, and conduct employee training, intended to ensure compliance with various economic sanctions and export controls, including the regulations of the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). We do not conduct any business in the following countries that are subject to U.S. economic sanctions: Cuba; Iran; North Korea; Syria and the Crimea region of the Ukraine. 
 
Competition
 
Many of our markets are highly competitive. However, we compete effectively due to the quality and breadth of our adhesives, sealants and specialty chemical portfolio and the experience and expertise of our commercial organizations. Within the adhesives and other specialty chemical markets, we believe few suppliers have comparable global reach and corresponding ability to deliver quality and consistency to multinational customers. Our competition is made up generally of two types of companies: (1) similar multinational suppliers and (2) regional or specialty suppliers that typically compete in only one region or within a narrow geographic area within a region. The multinational competitors typically maintain a broad product offering and range of technology, while regional or specialty companies tend to have limited or more focused product ranges and technology.
 
Principal competitive factors in the sale of adhesives and other specialty chemicals are product performance, supply assurance, technical service, quality, price and customer service.
 
Customers
 
We have cultivated strong, integrated relationships with a diverse set of customers worldwide. Our customers are among the technology and market leaders in consumer goods, construction and industrial markets. We pride ourselves on long-term, collaborative customer relationships and a diverse portfolio of customers in which no single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated net revenue.
 
Our leading customers include manufacturers of food and beverages, hygiene products, clothing, major appliances, electronics, automobiles, aerospace and defense products, solar energy systems, filters, construction materials, wood flooring, furniture, cabinetry, windows, doors, tissue and towel, corrugation, tube winding, packaging, labels and tapes.
 
Our products are delivered directly to customers primarily from our manufacturing and distribution facilities, with additional deliveries made through distributors and retailers.
 
Human Capital Resources and Management
 
Employees and Labor Relations
 
As of November 27, 2021, we have approximately 6,500 employees in 45 countries, including approximately 2,500 employees based in the U.S. Approximately 450 U.S. employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements with various unions. Approximately 750 employees in foreign countries are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Overall, we consider our employee relations to be good.
Health and Safety
 
We care about our colleagues and anyone who enters our workplace and we believe that nothing we do is worth getting hurt for. We have a strong environmental, health and safety program that focuses on implementing policies and training programs, as well as performing self-audits to enhance work safety. Importantly during 2021, our experience and continuing focus on workplace safety have enabled us to preserve business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our colleagues and workplace visitors safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Competitive Pay and Benefits
 
Our primary compensation strategy is “Pay for Performance”, which supports a culture of accountability and performance. Our compensation guiding principles are to structure compensation that is simple, aligned and balanced. We believe that these principles are strongly aligned with the strategic priorities of our business and our objective to deliver value for our shareholders.
 
We are committed to fair pay and strive to be externally competitive while ensuring internal equity across our organization. We conduct global pay equity assessments and compensation reviews, and when necessary, we take action to address areas of concern.
 
Quality, affordable health care is the foundation of the comprehensive benefits package we offer our employees. It is one of the tools we use to recruit and retain, and it is seen as the preferred benefit by most employees. Employees in the United States earning below $52,000 each year have 100% of their individual health care costs covered by the Company in the form of a medical premium reimbursement. 
 
Results-Driven, Collaborative Culture
 
Our purpose is connecting what matters for all stakeholders and we go about this by winning the right way through our core values. We expect employees to act with integrity and hold each other accountable for our actions. We value our global team’s diverse perspectives, backgrounds and experiences. We make daily, conscious choices to excel, by always bringing passion and creativity to our work, and by striving for innovation ethically and fairly. Our worldwide network of culture champions supports our focus on being At Our Best. Our communication on goals, targets and performance is frequent and transparent. We continue to leverage flexible work options available to employees who don't need our facilities to perform their jobs and this continues to enhance connections across the company, as well as with customers and external partners. This supports our desire to be first and fastest in finding solutions for customers and improving our overall effectiveness. Finally, we continue to take great pride in our focus on giving back to the communities in which we operate through the giving efforts of the H.B. Fuller Foundation and the thousands of employee volunteer hours each year.
Inclusion and Diversity
 
As a global company, we currently have employees present in over 40 countries around the world. We place strong value on collaboration and we believe that working together leads to better outcomes for our customers. This extends to the way we treat each other as team members. We strive to create an environment where innovative ideas can flourish by demonstrating respect for each other and valuing the diverse opinions, background and viewpoints of employees. We believe that diversity in our teams leads to new ideas, helps us solve problems and allows us to better connect with our global customer base.
 
We are taking specific actions to foster inclusion and diversity into our culture. Learning resources have been implemented to support greater awareness and understanding of the behaviors expected from employees. We have introduced employee networking groups, an expanded and enhanced mentoring program and focused development programs with the goal of creating meaningful opportunities for employees. We have adjusted our recruiting practices to ensure we are getting the right level of exposure to diverse candidates.
 
Talent Development
 
We recognize how important it is for our colleagues to develop and progress in their careers. We provide a variety of resources to help our colleagues grow in their current roles and build new skills, including online development resources focused on specific business imperatives with access to hundreds of online courses in our learning management system. We have implemented an innovative delivery method for leadership training to drive experiential learning and to increase access to leaders around the world. Individual development planning is a part of our annual goal setting process and people managers are expected to have regular discussions with employees to measure progress and make needed adjustments. We focus on getting employees into roles with greater responsibility and opportunities for advancement that are also aligned with their career path to facilitate development and maximize potential. Finally, we provide ambitious employees with short-term opportunities in unique assignments in addition to their current roles. These assignments support the employees’ development while also supporting company initiatives that are required to be resourced with talented employees.
Raw Materials
 
We use several principal raw materials in our manufacturing processes, including tackifying resins, polymers, synthetic rubbers, vinyl acetate monomer and plasticizers. We generally avoid sole source supplier arrangements for raw materials.
 
The majority of our raw materials are petroleum/natural gas based derivatives. Under normal conditions, raw materials are available on the open market. Prices and availability are subject to supply and demand market mechanisms. Raw material costs are primarily determined by the balance of supply against the aggregate demand from the adhesives industry and other industries that use the same raw material streams. The cost of crude oil and natural gas, the primary feedstocks for our raw materials, can also impact the cost of our raw materials.
 
See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on raw material cost and availability.
 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
Much of the technology we use in our products and manufacturing processes is available in the public domain. For technology not available in the public domain, we rely on trade secrets and patents when appropriate to protect our competitive position. We also license some patented technology from other sources. Our business is not materially dependent upon licenses or similar rights or on any single patent or group of related patents.
 
We enter into agreements with many employees to protect rights to technology and intellectual property. Confidentiality commitments also are routinely obtained from customers, suppliers and others to safeguard proprietary information.
 
We own numerous trademarks and service marks in various countries. Trademarks, such as H.B. Fuller®, Swift®, Advantra®, Clarity®, Sesame®, TEC®, Foster®, Rakoll®, Rapidex®, Full-Care®, Thermonex®, Silaprene®, Eternabond®, Cilbond®, and TONSAN® are important in marketing products. Many of our trademarks and service marks are registered. U.S. trademark registrations are for a term of ten years and are renewable every ten years as long as the trademarks are used in the regular course of trade.

Research and Development
 
Our investment in research and development creates new and innovative adhesive technology platforms, enhances product performance, ensures a competitive cost structure and leverages available raw materials. New product development is a key research and development outcome, providing higher-value solutions to existing customers or meeting new customers’ needs. Projects are developed in local laboratories in each region, where we understand our customer base the best. Platform developments are coordinated globally through our network of laboratories.
 
Through designing and developing new polymers and new formulations, we expect to continue to grow in our current markets. We also develop new applications for existing products and technologies, and improve manufacturing processes to enhance productivity and product quality. Research and development efforts are closely aligned to customer needs. We foster open innovation, seek supplier-driven new technology and use relationships with academic and other institutions to enhance our capabilities.
 
As climate change and other sustainability concerns become more prevalent, governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers and investors are increasingly focusing on these issues. We continue to monitor our markets to ensure we are developing the adhesives and sealants to support our customers’ responses to changing consumer demand, new product designs and upcoming regulatory and sustainability efforts. We invest significantly in innovation, research and expertise, which are crucial for the continuous extraction of value from our business strategy. This also facilitates the creation of new high-performance solutions that enable customers to improve their products and processes to better achieve their sustainability programs.
 
Regulatory Compliance
 
We comply with applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and workers' safety, including those required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and the EU’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulation. This includes regular review of and upgrades to environmental, health and safety policies, practices and procedures as well as improved production methods to minimize our facilities’ outgoing waste, based on evolving societal standards and increased environmental understanding. Expenditures to comply with environmental regulations over the next two years are estimated to be approximately $24.2 million, including approximately $3.7 million of capital expenditures. See additional disclosure under Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
 
Various legislation, regulations and international accords pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation, particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. We have not determined that any of these laws directly impact the Company at this time; however, we continue to monitor the development and implementation of such legislation and regulation. We also continue to regularly report our sustainability efforts and metrics under the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) framework and report our goals and progress in our annual Sustainability Report.
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) prohibits bribery of government officials to benefit business interests. We operate and sell our products in countries that are rated as high-risk for corruption, which creates the risk of unauthorized conduct by our employees, customs brokers, distributors or other third party intermediaries that could be in violation of the FCPA or similar local regulations. We comply with the FCPA’s requirements to make and keep accurate books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.
 
We are also subject to and comply with increasingly complex privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. This includes the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which enforces rules relating to the protection of processing and movement of personal data. The interpretation and enforcement of such regulations are continuously evolving and there may be uncertainty with respect to how to comply with them. Noncompliance with GDPR and other data protection laws could result in damage to our reputation and payment of monetary penalties.
 
Seasonality
 
Our operating segments have historically had lower net revenue in winter months, which is primarily our first fiscal quarter, mainly due to international holidays and the seasonal decline in construction and consumer spending activities.
