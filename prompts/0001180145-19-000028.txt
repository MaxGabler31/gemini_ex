Item 1.        Business.
Corporate Information
Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (“CSI”) was incorporated in Delaware in 2000. Our principal executive office is located at 1225 Old Highway 8 Northwest, St. Paul, Minnesota 55112. Our telephone number is (651) 259-1600, and our website is www.csi360.com. The information contained in or accessible through our website is not incorporated by reference into, and should not be considered part of, this Form 10-K.
Business Overview
We are a medical technology company leading the way in the effort to successfully treat patients suffering from peripheral and coronary artery diseases, including those with arterial calcium, the most difficult form of arterial disease to treat. We are committed to clinical rigor, constant innovation and a defining drive to set the industry standard to deliver safe and effective medical devices that improve the lives of patients facing this difficult disease state. We have developed a patented orbital atherectomy systems (“OAS”) for both peripheral and coronary commercial applications. The primary base of our business is catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of vessel sizes and plaque types, including calcified plaque, which address many of the limitations associated with other treatment alternatives. To date, more than 450,000 patients have been treated with our OAS devices and we continue to expand our footprint to serve more patients with cardiovascular disease. 
Peripheral
Our peripheral artery disease (“PAD”) products are catheter-based platforms capable of treating a broad range of plaque types in leg arteries both above and below the knee, including calcified plaque, and address many of the limitations associated with other existing surgical, catheter and pharmacological treatment alternatives. The micro-invasive devices use small access sheaths that can provide procedural benefits and allow physicians to treat PAD patients in even the small and tortuous vessels located below the knee and facilitate access through alternative sites in the ankle, foot and wrist, as well as in the groin. 
The United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) granted 510(k) clearance for various OAS device products as a therapy in patients with PAD. We refer to these products in this Form 10-K as the “Peripheral OAS.” In addition to our Peripheral OAS, we also offer support products within the peripheral space. Peripheral sales in the United States during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 represented 72% of revenue.
Coronary
Our coronary artery disease (“CAD”) product, the Diamondback 360 Coronary OAS (“Coronary OAS”), is a catheter-based platform designed to facilitate stent delivery in patients with CAD who are acceptable candidates for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or stenting due to de novo, severely calcified coronary artery lesions. The Coronary OAS design is similar to technology used in our Peripheral OAS, customized specifically for the coronary application. In addition to the Coronary OAS, we also offer support products within the coronary space as we expand treatment to a broader patient population with complex coronary artery disease.
In October 2013, we received premarket approval (“PMA”) from the FDA to market the Coronary OAS as a treatment for severely calcified coronary arteries and we commenced a commercial launch that same month. Coronary sales in the United States during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 represented approximately 25% of revenue. 
International
In February 2018, the Coronary OAS Micro Crown received reimbursement approval in Japan, followed by the first commercial sales in Japan. This represented the first international market for any of our products, and more importantly, an opportunity to provide physicians in Japan a cost-effective treatment option for the difficult-to-treat patient population with severely calcified coronary lesions. In January 2019, Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (“MHLW”) approved our Coronary OAS Classic Crown and the ViperWire Advance Guidewire with FlexTip, and in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, sales of this product commenced in Japan. Sales of our products in Japan are made through our exclusive Japan distributor, Medikit Co., Ltd.
In October 2014, we received CE Mark for our Stealth 360 Peripheral OAS, and in fiscal 2019, we commenced sales of this product in certain countries in Southeast Asia, Europe and the Middle East and of our Coronary OAS in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Sales of our products in the rest of the world are made through our exclusive international distributor, OrbusNeich®.
International sales during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 represented approximately 3% of revenue. 
Market Overview
Peripheral Artery Disease (“PAD”)
Peripheral artery disease is widespread and can be life threatening. The disease is characterized by narrowed, hardened arteries in the legs, limiting blood flow to the legs and feet. If left untreated, PAD may continue to progress to Critical Limb Ischemia (“CLI”), a condition in which the amount of oxygenated blood being delivered to the limb is insufficient to keep the tissue viable. CLI may lead to non-healing ulcers, infections, gangrene, limb amputation or death. In many older PAD patients, particularly those with diabetes, PAD is characterized by fibrotic (moderately hard) or calcified (extremely hard) plaque deposits that can be very challenging to treat. Although we believe the rate of PAD diagnoses is increasing, we also believe that under-diagnosis continues, due to patient and physician awareness. Emphasis on PAD education from industry, medical associations, insurance companies and other groups, coupled with publications in medical journals and public news channels, is increasing physician and patient awareness of PAD risk factors, symptoms, and treatment options. Physicians manage a significant portion of the PAD diagnosed population by recommending lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, and by prescribing prescription drugs, such as statins. While medications, diet and exercise may improve blood flow, they do not treat the underlying vascular occlusions, and many patients have difficulty maintaining lifestyle changes. As a result of these challenges, many medically managed patients develop more severe symptoms that require procedural intervention.
Coronary Artery Disease (“CAD”)
Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease in the United States and is a life-threatening condition. CAD occurs when a fatty material called plaque builds up on the walls of arteries that supply blood to the heart. The plaque buildup causes the arteries to harden and narrow (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow. The risk of calcific CAD increases with age and if a person has one or more of the following: high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, or family history of early heart disease. Significant calcium contributes to poor outcomes and higher treatment costs in coronary interventions when traditional therapies are used, including a significantly higher occurrence of death and major adverse cardiac events.
Our Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS
Our orbital atherectomy systems represent a unique and innovative approach to the treatment of PAD and CAD that provide physicians and patients with a procedure that addresses many of the limitations of other treatment alternatives. The Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS devices are single-use catheters that incorporate a control handle and flexible drive shaft with an eccentrically mounted diamond-coated crown. The peripheral device is often used for vessel preparation to enable low pressure percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, including the use of drug-coated balloons, and results in lower use of bailout stents. The coronary device is similarly used to prepare a vessel by treating severe calcium prior to stent delivery to help facilitate vessel access and stent expansion and prevent malapposition of stent struts for optimal stent performance.
The OAS treats atherosclerotic plaque, which is harder than a normal vessel wall. The OAS is designed to differentiate between hard, diseased plaque and healthy, compliant arterial tissue, a concept that we refer to as “differential sanding.” The diamond-coated crown preferentially engages and sands away harder material, but is designed not to damage more compliant parts of the artery, which flex away from the crown. Physicians position the crown at the site of a lesion containing arterial plaque and orbit the crown against it to sand away the superficial, or surface, plaque and create a smooth lumen, or channel, in the vessel. In addition, the crown’s rotating eccentric mass and orbital motion deliver pulsatile mechanical energy into the vessel wall. These pulsatile forces may break up deeper plaque and contribute to improving the compliance change of the diseased segment of the artery. 
Multiple Applications

The unique OAS mechanism of action used in both the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS can be used to treat multiple anatomic locations.

• | Below-the-Knee and Behind-the-Knee Peripheral Artery Disease. Arteries below and behind the knee are smaller in diameter and may be diffusely stenosed, calcified or both. Reaching and treating these small vessels requires a low profile, which most competitive devices do not offer. Behind-the-knee, or popliteal, lesions also present challenges if a stent is used because stents frequently fracture in this area due to the forces exerted on the vessels when the knee bends or flexes. The Peripheral OAS is effective in treating those vessels. The Peripheral OAS offers a shorter shaft length (60cm), a smaller profile and a more flexible shaft than the predecessors for improved ease of use, and includes a 4-Fr catheter that enables physicians to access lesions below-the-knee using retrograde access through arteries in the ankle or foot. 


• | Above-the-Knee Peripheral Artery Disease. Arteries above the knee are typically longer, straighter and wider than below-the-knee vessels. Plaque in these arteries may also be diffuse, fibrotic and calcific. Physicians often use higher speeds or larger crown sizes of our products to treat lesions above the knee. Our newest Peripheral OAS innovation includes the addition of extended length OAS that can treat above-the-knee disease through trans-radial access (access through the radial artery in the wrist). The ability to treat the larger above-the-knee arteries with OAS via the small trans-radial access sites is made possible by the unique features of the OAS including its small crossing profile and ability to orbit at higher speeds for treatment of larger vessels. 


• | Coronary Artery Disease. The individuals more at risk for being diagnosed with CAD are those that are suffering from high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, renal insufficiency, or have a family history of heart disease. The pathogenesis of CAD is marked by the accumulation of a fatty material called plaque on the walls of arteries that supply blood to the heart. The plaque buildup causes the arteries to harden and narrow (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow. The Coronary OAS is the only atherectomy device specifically indicated for severe coronary calcium. 

We believe the strong safety profile and proven efficacy of our OAS, stemming from the design of the product and demonstrated through key clinical trials offers additional benefits to patients. Furthermore, the short set-up time and short procedure time offer an easy to use and cost efficient treatment option for physicians. 
Our Supporting Products 
In addition to our OAS, we offer additional products aimed at supporting procedures that use our OAS.

• | Guidewires. The ViperWire guide wires are required for using the OAS and were designed to offer the ability to maneuver through tortuous, twisting blood vessels and cross challenging lesions. The OAS travels over this wire to the lesion and operates on this wire. Our ZILIENT Peripheral guidewires further expand our low-profile endovascular portfolio and feature TWISTER® Core Wire Technology, a proprietary stainless steel core design that offers strong support with navigation and torque response. The ZILIENT guidewires are designed to get to and across lesions and includes four tip load choices across two diameters. 


• | Catheters. We sell OrbusNeich Teleport Microcatheters in the United States through an exclusive distribution agreement with OrbusNeich. We also sell our ViperCath XC Peripheral Exchange Catheter, which is the only 200 cm exchange catheter available to address the need for an extended length catheter when performing procedures with a radial access point.


• | Balloons. We sell the OrbusNeich Sapphire semi compliant (“SC”) and Sapphire non-compliant (“NC”) balloon portfolio in the United States, which includes the only 1.0mm SC balloon on the United States market. Sapphire SC balloons are optimized for lesion entry and crossing with stainless steel hypo-tube for increased pushability and kink resistance. Sapphire NC balloons are optimized for robustness under high pressure and reliable sizing.


• | Other OAS Support Products. Our OAS uses a small, portable saline infusion pump that bathes the OAS shaft and crown and provides an electric power supply for the operation of the catheter. We also sell ViperSlide Lubricant designed to optimize the smooth operation of the OAS.

Our Strategy
Our goal is to be the leading provider of solutions for the treatment of PAD and CAD. We intend to broaden our product offering and expand to new international markets. The key elements of our strategy include:

• | Drive Adoption through Our Direct U.S. Sales Organization, Medical Education and Key Opinion Leaders. We expect to continue to drive adoption of the OAS in both hospital and office-based lab settings through the strong support of a clinically knowledgeable direct U.S. sales force focused on the needs of interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists and their cath lab teams. A key element of our strategy is a focus on educating and training physicians about disease states, our clinical data, and proper use and application of OAS technology through programs delivered via physician faculty, our direct sales force and seminars where physician industry leaders discuss case studies and treatment techniques using the devices. 


• | Build a Strong Portfolio of Clinical Evidence on Safety, Effectiveness and Economic Benefits of the OAS. Physicians and payors are increasingly interested in clinical and economic evidence to support decisions regarding optimal treatment of patients. We are focused on conducting robust clinical studies that provide insight into and demonstrate the effectiveness of the OAS in treating complex peripheral and coronary artery disease. We believe that demonstrating the clinical advantages and cost-effectiveness of our OAS technology is critical to support physician adoption of the OAS, drive best clinical practice, and sustain ongoing reimbursement coverage for our devices. 


• | Enhance OAS and Expand Product Portfolio within the Market for Treatment of Peripheral and Coronary Arteries. In addition to continued innovation and product development on our peripheral and coronary OAS platforms, we are growing our product portfolio to offer new accessories and devices that improve outcomes and expand the patient population we can treat. See “Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships” and “Research and Development Activities - Development Activities” for descriptions of new products in development. 


• | Expand Internationally. In February 2018, we announced reimbursement approval and our first commercially treated patient in Japan. This represented our first entry into the international market, and most importantly, an opportunity to provide physicians in Japan with a cost-effective treatment option for the difficult-to-treat patient population with severely calcified coronary lesions. In January 2019, Japan’s MHLW approved our Coronary OAS Classic Crown, and in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, sales of this product commenced in Japan.

In October 2014, we received CE Mark for our Stealth 360 Peripheral OAS and in fiscal 2019, we commenced sales of our products in certain countries in Southeast Asia, Europe and the Middle East.

• | Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships. In addition to adding to our product portfolio through internal development efforts, we are opportunistically seeking ways to expand our portfolio through acquisitions, distribution agreements, licensing transactions, manufacturing agreements and other strategic partnerships to add new product lines and technologies that leverage our sales expertise and footprint or complement our strategic objectives. We have an exclusive U.S. distribution agreement with OrbusNeich to offer their full line of semi-compliant, non-compliant and specialty balloons and the Teleport Microcatheter. In addition, we have entered into an agreement with Integer Holdings Corporation to manufacture our ZILIENT™ peripheral guidewires, and we are co-developing a new laser atherectomy device in collaboration with Aerolase Corporation. Finally, in August 2019, we acquired the WIRION Embolic Protection System and related assets from Gardia Medical Ltd., a wholly owned Israeli subsidiary of Allium Medical Solutions Ltd. This device is a distal embolic protection filter used to capture debris that can be associated with all types of peripheral vascular intervention procedures. We plan to commercialize the WIRION System in the United States following the transfer of manufacturing from Gardia Medical, which we expect to be completed after a 12 to 15 month transition period. Gardia Medical has retained the rights to the WIRION System for angioplasty and stenting procedures in the carotid arteries. 

Research and Development Activities
Clinical Studies Summary
We study the most challenging patient populations and are committed to providing relevant clinical evidence that enables physicians to select and utilize the best treatment options for their patients. A total of 6,674 subjects (4,794 PAD and 1,880 CAD) have been enrolled in our clinical studies as of June 30, 2019. Our clinical studies incorporate rigorous long-term clinical and healthcare economic data that are critical to improving patient care and ongoing healthcare changes.
PAD Studies
The following PAD clinical studies were completed or in process during fiscal 2019:

• | REACH-PVI. This prospective, observational, single-arm, multi-center post-market study conducted in the United States is designed to evaluate acute clinical outcomes of orbital atherectomy via transradial access for treatment of PAD in lower extremity lesions. Approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled in REACH-PVI and will be followed post-procedure through the first standard of care follow-up visit (7 to 45 days post-procedure).


• | LIBERTY 360°. This prospective, observational, multi-center clinical study is evaluating the procedural and long-term clinical, quality of life and economic outcomes of endovascular device interventions, including orbital atherectomy, for the treatment of PAD. We expect the results from this study to increase our understanding of the clinical and economic outcomes of endovascular treatment for PAD patients, including those with the most advanced form of the disease, Rutherford Class 6. Enrollment of 1,204 subjects at 51 sites in the United States was completed in February 2016. 

LIBERTY 360° one-year data were published in the Journal of Endovascular Therapy in April 2019. Additionally, two-year economic data and 2.5-year clinical data were presented at New Cardiovascular Horizons in May 2019 and at the International Symposium on Endovascular Therapy in January 2019, respectively. The majority of devices used in the study were balloons and/or atherectomy, and the Peripheral OAS was the most frequently used atherectomy device. Initial treatment costs and total 2-year costs varied significantly according to symptom burden and clinical and lesion-level characteristics. After adjustment for censoring, cumulative 2-year costs were substantially higher among patients with at least one chronic total occlusion, longer lesion length, severe calcification, greater lesion complexity, and more distal lesion location. The LIBERTY 360° data through 2.5 years demonstrate that peripheral interventions can be used successfully across all Rutherford Classes, including the most challenging Rutherford Class 6 subjects. An orbital atherectomy subanalysis of the LIBERTY 360° data indicated high freedom from major amputation at 2.5 years in all Rutherford Classes (RC2-3, 100.0%; RC4-5, 95.3%; and RC6, 88.6%). Overall, the results of this novel all-comers PAD study suggest that peripheral vascular intervention (“PVI”) is an alternative to “primary amputation” in Rutherford Class 6 patients. Additionally, data from the LIBERTY 360° study provide further evidence to support PVI treatment in Rutherford Class 2-5 patients.
CAD Studies
We have conducted two clinical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Coronary OAS Classic Crown device: the ORBIT I feasibility study and the ORBIT II pivotal study. The safety and efficacy of the Coronary OAS Micro Crown device were evaluated in the COAST study.
The following CAD clinical study was in process during fiscal 2019:

• | ECLIPSE. This post-market, randomized one-to-one, multi-center trial is designed to evaluate vessel preparation with Coronary OAS Classic Crown compared to conventional angioplasty technique prior to drug-eluting stent implantation for the treatment of severely calcified lesions. Approximately 2,000 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 150 sites in the United States and subjects will be followed for up to two years. The co-primary endpoints of acute minimum stent area (assessed by optical coherence tomography in a subset of equally randomized 500 subjects) and one-year target vessel failure are powered to demonstrate superiority of OAS vessel preparation vs. conventional angioplasty.

Our clinical portfolio is expanding as we develop future studies to answer difficult questions about PAD and CAD treatment. Our clinical research continues to highlight the safety and efficacy of the OAS and current and new research illustrates our versatility in the emerging vascular market.
Development Activities
Our product research and development activities are dedicated to the development and commercialization of products that serve the peripheral and coronary vascular disease space, with emphasis towards high margin products and complex arterial disease states treated by our primary customers. The focus and value proposition of our products is to enable positive acute and long-term clinical outcomes, with efficiency and predictability, in challenging patient subsets.
Research and development resources have been strategically allocated between opportunities that maximize the clinical effectiveness and user satisfaction of our OAS product line and the development of additional products that offer portfolio diversification and incremental revenue opportunities.
Specific to the peripheral vascular disease market, we will continue our commitment to patients suffering from CLI through a breadth of above-the-knee and below-the-knee differentiated products that treat or uniquely expand the ability of our devices to treat obstructive lesions throughout the leg and foot. Most recently, we launched a next generation platform of our Diamondback 360 OAS, the Exchangeable Series. The Exchangeable Series offers multiple new features and benefits, notably the ability to use multiple crowns with one handle unit for those most challenging multi-level disease CLI patients. The system also includes GlideAssist, which was launched in the Coronary OAS in 2018. GlideAssist enables smooth tracking of the device catheter to and from target lesions when distal, tortuous and/or small vessels must be traversed. 
Within the coronary vascular disease market, we are building a portfolio of differentiated products that are used to treat complex CAD. We launched the Coronary OAS Classic Crown in Japan in early 2019 along with a new ViperWire Advance Guidewire with FlexTip. The FlexTip guidewire utilizes a Nitinol core versus the stainless steel core of the first generation coronary ViperWire. The new core material, combined with a softer spring tip, enables OAS access to more challenging lesions and anatomy, especially when tortuosity or angulation is present. The FlexTip guidewire is currently under review with the FDA.
In July 2018 we announced our agreement with Aerolase Corp. for the co-development of a new laser atherectomy device. We are also developing a new percutaneous ventricular assist device. We continue to focus our efforts on other new organic technologies and devices that are aimed at addressing unmet or under-met clinical or technical needs in our target markets.
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell the majority of our products through a direct sales force in the United States, with direct shipments to hospitals or clinics. We have targeted sales and marketing efforts to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists with experience using similar catheter-based procedures, such as angioplasty, stenting, and directional or laser atherectomy. Professional education is also a key element of our sales strategy.
We target our marketing efforts to practitioners through medical conferences, seminars, peer-reviewed journals and marketing materials. Our sales and marketing program focuses on:

• | clinical results showing safety and efficacy of our products;


• | educating physicians on the prevalence and complications of calcium in PAD and CAD; and


• | developing relationships with key opinion leaders.

We are party to a purchasing agreement with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, L.P. (“HPG”), which was renewed effective May 1, 2018 and expires on July 31, 2021. HPG acts as a group purchasing organization for the healthcare providers belonging to HPG as participants. Under the purchasing agreement, all of HPG’s participants located in the United States or its territories are eligible to purchase our OAS and related products at prices set forth in the purchasing agreement. The purchasing agreement may be terminated at any time, without cause, by HPG upon at least 60 days’ prior written notice to us. Either party may terminate the purchasing agreement upon the occurrence of a material breach by the other party that goes uncured within 30 days following receipt of written notice of such breach. If the purchasing agreement with HPG were to be terminated, our financial results will be materially adversely affected.
Sales of our products in Japan are through our exclusive Japan distributor, Medikit. Outside of the United States and Japan, sales are made through the current sales and distribution network of OrbusNeich, our exclusive distributor for the rest of the world. 
We have observed some degree of seasonality in our business, as there tends to be a lower number of procedures that use our products during the three months ending September 30. Interventional procedure volume usually grows throughout the course of the fiscal year, with the quarter ending June 30 usually representing the highest volume of cases and, therefore, the highest amount of revenue generated by us during the course of the fiscal year. 
Manufacturing

We use internally-manufactured and externally-sourced components to manufacture the OAS. Most of the externally-sourced components are available from multiple suppliers; however, certain key components, including the diamond-grit-coated crown and our ViperSlide Lubricant, are single sourced. Single source supplier risk is mitigated by regularly assessing quality and capacity of suppliers, implementing supply and quality agreements, appropriate inventory level management and duplication of production capacity, where possible.
We are located in a leased 125,000-square-foot corporate headquarters in Minnesota. This custom-designed building has space for more than 500 employees and contains dedicated research and development, training and education, and manufacturing facilities. Depending on staffing, the facility has the annual capacity to produce in excess of 75,000 devices per shift. The finished goods storage has capacity for approximately 20,000 devices and more than 500 saline infusion pumps, as well as other accessory products.
Our leased Pearland, Texas facility is 46,000 square feet and includes a custom-built clean room and production space for future expansion of value-add processes, including machining and electronics assembly. The facility, when fully staffed and equipped, also has the annual capacity to produce approximately 75,000 devices per shift. This facility has finished goods storage capacity for greater than 15,000 devices and other accessory products and over 500 saline infusion pumps. 
We are registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”). We have opted to maintain a Quality Management System to enable us to market our products in the member states of the European Union, the European Free Trade Association and countries that have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements with the European Union. We are ISO 13485:2016 certified, and our renewal is due in December 2021. Under these registrations, our plants are audited by the FDA and our Notified Body. The Stealth 360 Peripheral OAS has received CE Mark. We are registered as a Foreign Medical Device Manufacturer in Japan and our registration certificate renewal is due in June 2021.
Third-Party Reimbursement and Pricing

Third-party payors, including private insurers and government insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, pay for a significant portion of patient care provided in the United States. The single largest payor in the United States is the Medicare program, a federal governmental health insurance program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). Medicare covers certain medical care expenses for eligible elderly and disabled individuals, including a large percentage of the population with PAD and CAD who could be treated with the OAS. In addition, private insurers often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare. Consequently, Medicare’s coverage and reimbursement policies are important to our operations.
CMS establishes Medicare reimbursement coverage policy and payment rates for physician and facility healthcare services, including procedures using atherectomy products. Obtaining and maintaining coding, coverage and payment for our products is critical for commercial success. We believe that physicians and hospitals that treat PAD and CAD with the respective OAS will generally be eligible to receive reimbursement from Medicare, as well as from private insurers, that is adequate to cover the costs of the OAS, associated materials, and physician’s services.
Outside of the United States, in January 2019, we received reimbursement approval for our Coronary OAS Classic Crown in Japan. In connection with our international distribution agreement with OrbusNeich, we and OrbusNeich will seek reimbursement approvals in other countries in connection with the commercial introductions of our products, to the extent that reimbursement is available and subject to local rules and regulations.
Competition

The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Our OAS competes with a variety of other products or devices for the treatment of vascular disease, including stents, balloon angioplasty catheters and atherectomy catheters, as well as products used in vascular surgery. Competitors in the stent, balloon angioplasty and microcatheter market segments include Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific, Medtronic, Cook Medical, Johnson & Johnson, Becton Dickinson, Terumo, Asahi, Teleflex and Cordis. We also compete against manufacturers of atherectomy catheters and other products designed to treat vascular disease, including Medtronic, Philips/Spectranetics, Boston Scientific, Ra Medical, Eximo Medical, Shockwave and Avinger, as well as manufacturers that may enter the market due to the increasing demand for treatment of vascular disease. Other competitors 
include pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs for the treatment of PAD and CAD and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral and coronary bypass procedures. 
Because of the size of the peripheral opportunities, competitors and potential competitors have historically dedicated significant resources to aggressively promote their products. We believe that our Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS compete primarily on the basis of:

• | safety and efficacy, even in calcified plaque (or severely calcified plaque in the coronaries);


• | low profile and alternative access site capabilities;


• | predictable clinical performance;


• | availability of clinical data;


• | ease of use;


• | economic benefit;


• | key opinion leader support and customer base; and


• | customer service and support.

We are aware of a company, Cardio Flow, Inc., developing an atherectomy system that could potentially compete with our products. On August 27, 2012, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with Lela Nadirashvili, the widow of Dr. Leonid Shturman, our founder, relating to the ownership of certain patents invented by Dr. Shturman. We believe that Ms. Nadirashvili assigned her rights under the Settlement Agreement, including the right to utilize certain patents, to Cardio Flow. On April 6, 2018, we filed a breach of contract action against Cardio Flow, alleging that Cardio Flow has developed or is in the process of developing an atherectomy device that incorporates elements belonging exclusively to us, in violation of the Settlement Agreement. We are seeking damages and a permanent injunction preventing Cardio Flow from taking further steps to develop or attempt to develop an atherectomy device that incorporates the elements that belong exclusively to us. We are pursuing our claims against Cardio Flow vigorously.
Patents and Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and other intellectual property laws, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights. Our U.S. and foreign issued patents and patent applications relate primarily to the design and operation of interventional atherectomy devices, including the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS. These patents and applications include claims covering key aspects of orbital atherectomy devices, including the design, manufacture and therapeutic use of certain atherectomy abrasive heads, drive shafts, control systems, handles and couplings. As we continue to research and develop our atherectomy technology, we intend to file additional U.S. and foreign patent applications related to the design, manufacture and therapeutic uses of atherectomy devices. As described at the beginning of this Form 10-K within the “Preliminary Notes,” we also have numerous registered trademarks throughout various geographies.
We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also forbid them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us. We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
Government Regulation of Medical Devices
Governmental authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local levels and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of medical devices such as the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS.
Failure to obtain approval to market our products under development and to meet the ongoing requirements of these regulatory authorities could prevent us from marketing and continuing to market our products.
United States
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and the FDA’s implementing regulations govern medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post market surveillance. Medical 
devices and their manufacturers are also subject to inspection by the FDA. The FDCA, supplemented by other federal and state laws, also provides civil and criminal penalties for violations of its provisions.
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the United States will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization are premarket notification (also called 510(k) clearance) and PMA.
510(k) Clearance.    To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device legally marketed in the United States. A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data. Generally, the 510(k) clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a year or more.
After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA (if the device as modified is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device). The determination as to whether new authorization is needed is initially left to the manufacturer; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
We have received 510(k) clearances for the Peripheral OAS products.
Premarket Approval.    A PMA application requires the payment of significant user fees and must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device. A PMA application must also include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling. After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with the FDA’s QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
FDA review of a PMA application is required by statute to take no longer than 180 days, although the process typically takes significantly longer, and may require several years to complete. The FDA can delay, limit, or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:

• | the systems may not be safe or effective to the FDA’s satisfaction;


• | the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval;


• | the manufacturing process or facilities used may not meet applicable requirements; and


• | changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.

If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA application. Even if PMA is issued, the FDA may approve the device with an indication that is narrower or more limited than originally sought. The agency can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of the device as a condition of approval, or impose post approval requirements such as continuing evaluation and periodic reporting on the safety, efficacy, and reliability of the device for its intended use.
New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require 
submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
Clinical Trials.  Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance. These trials generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites.
FDA approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. With certain exceptions, changes made to an investigational plan after an IDE is approved must be submitted in an IDE supplement and approved by FDA (and by governing institutional review boards when appropriate) prior to implementation.
All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with regulations and requirements collectively known as good clinical practice. Good clinical practices include the FDA’s IDE regulations, which describe the conduct of clinical trials with medical devices, including the recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of sponsors and investigators, and labeling of investigational devices. They also prohibit promotion, test marketing or commercialization of an investigational device and any representation that such a device is safe or effective for the purposes being investigated. Good clinical practices also include the FDA’s regulations for institutional review board approval and for protection of human subjects (such as informed consent), as well as disclosure of financial interests by clinical investigators.
Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product. The commencement or completion of any clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application or clearance of a premarket notification for numerous reasons.
Continuing Regulation.    After a device is cleared or approved for use and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:

• | establishment registration and device listing upon the commencement of manufacturing;


• | the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during medical device design and manufacturing processes;


• | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and promotional activities;


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if malfunctions were to recur;


• | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections; and


• | product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device that may present a risk to health.

In addition, the FDA may require a company to conduct post market surveillance studies or order it to establish and maintain a system for tracking its products through the chain of distribution to the patient level.
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions:

• | warning letters or untitled letters;


• | fines, injunctions and civil penalties;


• | product recall or seizure;


• | unanticipated expenditures;


• | delays in clearing or approving or refusal to clear or approve products;


• | withdrawal or suspension of FDA approval;


• | orders for physician notification or device repair, replacement or refund;


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production or clinical trials; or


• | criminal prosecution.

We and our contract manufacturers, specification developers and suppliers are also required to manufacture our products in compliance with current good manufacturing practice requirements set forth in the QSR.
The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing and record keeping. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors. If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to clear or approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business.
Fraud and Abuse
Our operations are directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the FDCA, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, our sales, marketing, education and clinical programs.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government. Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
In addition to the laws described above, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
On June 28, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the U.S. government, acting through the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of North Carolina (the “DOJ”) and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (the “OIG”) and Travis Thams to resolve the DOJ investigation of whether we violated the False Claims Act. In connection with the resolution of this matter, we entered into a five-year corporate integrity agreement (the “Corporate Integrity Agreement”) with the OIG. The Corporate Integrity Agreement requires that we maintain our existing compliance programs and imposes certain expanded compliance-related requirements during the term of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, including establishment of specific procedures and requirements regarding consulting activities, co-marketing activities and other interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare institutions and the sale and marketing of our products; ongoing monitoring, reporting, certification and training obligations; and the engagement of an independent review organization to perform certain auditing and reviews and prepare certain reports regarding our compliance with federal health care programs. 
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the “Sunshine Act”) and certain state laws require persons to collect and report certain data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. It is widely anticipated that public 
reporting under the Sunshine Act and implementing Open Payment regulations will result in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, physicians and teaching hospitals.
Voluntary industry codes, federal guidance documents and a variety of state laws address the tracking and reporting of marketing practices relative to gifts given and other expenditures made to doctors and other healthcare professionals. In addition to impacting our marketing and educational programs, our internal business processes are and will continue to be affected by the numerous legal requirements and regulatory guidance at the state, federal and industry levels.
International Regulation 
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact the cost, the time needed to approve, and, ultimately, our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products. Regulations of the FDA and, as we continue our international expansions, regulatory agencies outside the United States, may impose extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on us and our operations. Additionally, the time required to obtain approval in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ. For example, the primary regulatory environment in Europe with respect to medical devices is that of the European Union, which includes most of the major countries in Europe. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the European Union, although actual implementation of these directives may vary on a country-by-country basis. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of submission of a design dossier, self-assessment by the manufacturer, a third-party assessment, and review of the design dossier by a “Notified Body.” This third-party assessment generally consists of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and manufacturing site, as well as review of the technical documentation used to support application of the CE Mark to one’s product and possibly specific testing of the manufacturer’s product. An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the European Union is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union. The new European Medical Device Regulation (the “EU MDR”) will come into effect in May 2020, which will substantially expand the applicable premarket and postmarket requirements in Europe.
As part of our Japan commercialization process we are subject to the requirements of the Japanese Act on Securing Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, Regenerative and Cellular Therapy Products, Gene Therapy Products, and Cosmetics (the “PMD Act”). Our quality management system and products are subject to review and examination by Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency and subject to approval and enforcement by Japan’s MHLW. The critical suppliers named in our application are also subject to this review and examination for the activities they perform for us. Non-compliance with the PMD Act could result in revocation or suspension of our license, revocation of approvals, and criminal sanctions such as fines and/or imprisonment. 
In connection with the introduction of our products in other countries, we will need to seek regulatory approvals under the rules and regulations applicable in each such country and we will be required to comply with ongoing requirements, which may be varied and require us to expend substantial resources.
In addition, our international expansion, operations, distribution and sales will require us to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions and with U.S. and foreign export control, trade embargo and custom laws, as well as foreign tax laws; employment, immigration and labor laws; local intellectual property laws, which may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States; and privacy laws such as the European General Data Protection Regulation.
Environmental Regulation
Our operations are subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances. We are currently classified and licensed as a Very Small Quantity Hazardous Waste Generator within Ramsey County, Minnesota. There are no regulated wastes requiring licensing in our Texas facility.
Employees
As of June 30, 2019, we had 731 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement. We conduct an annual employment engagement survey and we believe that our employee relations are good.
