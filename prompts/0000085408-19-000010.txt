ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Rowan Companies plc is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and listed on the NYSE. The terms “Rowan,” “Rowan plc,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” are used to refer to Rowan plc and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
We are a global provider of offshore contract drilling services to the oil and gas industry, with a focus on ultra-deepwater drillships and high-specification and premium jack-up rigs. Many of our high specification jack-up rigs are also rated for operating in harsh environments. Our fleet operates worldwide, including the US GOM, Mexico, Central and South America, the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, the Middle East and the Mediterranean Sea. We currently operate in three segments: Deepwater, Jack-ups and ARO, our 50/50 joint venture with Saudi Aramco. The Deepwater segment includes four ultra-deepwater drillships. The Jack-ups segment is composed of 21 self-elevating jack-up rigs and includes the impact of the various arrangements with ARO (see Note 4 of the "Consolidated Financial Statements" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. The information discussed therein is incorporated by reference into this Part I, Item 1.) ARO currently owns a fleet of seven self-elevating jack-up rigs for operation in the Arabian Gulf for Saudi Aramco. ARO has plans to order up to 20 new jack-up rigs over the next 10 years. 
As of February 13, 2019, the date of our most recent Fleet Status Report, two of our four drillships were contracted in the US GOM, one was contracted in Mexico and the remaining drillship was marketed without a contract in the US GOM. For our jack-up fleet, we had four rigs under contract in the North Sea, one rig under contract in the Mediterranean Sea, three under contract in Central and South America and two under contract in the US GOM. In the Middle East, we had nine jack-ups leased to ARO to fulfill nine, three-year contracts between Saudi Aramco and ARO, two of which are expected to commence in the first half of 2019. Additionally, we own two jack-up rigs which are cold stacked.
We contract our drilling rigs, related equipment and work crews primarily on a “day rate” basis. Under day rate contracts, we generally receive a fixed amount per day for each day we are performing drilling or related services. In addition, our customers may pay all or a portion of the cost of moving our equipment and personnel to and from the well site. Contracts generally range in duration from one month to multiple years. Rigs leased to ARO will be through bareboat charter agreements whereby substantially all operating costs will be borne by ARO. ARO will contract with the customer, Saudi Aramco, and directly receive related revenue. For Rowan plc and its consolidated subsidiaries, intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Proposed Combination of Rowan Companies plc and Ensco plc
On October 7, 2018, the Company entered into a Transaction Agreement with Ensco, to effect a “merger-of-equals” transaction. The Transaction Agreement was amended as of January 28, 2019, pursuant to a Deed of Amendment No. 1 to a Transaction Agreement (the “Amendment”). In the Transaction Agreement, as amended, each of the issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares of the Company will be exchanged (the “Transaction”) for 2.750 Class A ordinary shares of Ensco, each with a nominal value of $0.10 per share. The Transaction is being implemented by means of a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement (the “Scheme”) under Part 26 of the U.K. Companies Act 2006 (provided that the parties reserve the right under the Transaction Agreement to effect the acquisition by way of a contractual takeover offer as defined in section 974 of the U.K. Companies Act 2006 in certain circumstances). The resulting new combined company will be renamed and trade under a new ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange.
The completion of the Transaction is subject to various closing conditions, including, among other things, (i) the sanction of a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement by the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, (ii) the receipt of the required regulatory approval or elapse of the review period with respect thereto in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, (iii) the absence of legal restraints prohibiting or restraining the Transaction and (iv) the absence of any law or order reasonably expected to result in the dissolution of ARO, the sale or disposition of the Company’s interest in ARO, or the forfeiture or nationalization of the Company's interest in ARO or ARO’s assets. The Transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2019.
The Transaction Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Rowan and Ensco including, among other things: (i) by Rowan or Ensco, if the other party breaches or fails to perform any of its representations, warranties or covenants in the Transaction Agreement that cannot be or is not cured in accordance with the terms of the Transaction Agreement and such breach constitutes a “material adverse effect”, (ii) by Rowan, in the event that the board of directors of Ensco makes an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) or upon any “willful breach” by Ensco of the non-solicitation covenant and (iii) by Ensco, in the event that the board of directors of Rowan makes an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined in the 
6

Transaction Agreement) or upon any “willful breach” by Rowan of the non-solicitation covenant. If the Transaction Agreement is terminated in accordance with clause (i), (ii) or (iii), then Rowan or Ensco, as the applicable terminating party, shall be required to pay the other a termination fee of $24.0 million (the “Termination Fee”). 
Neither Rowan nor Ensco is permitted, among other things, to solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a takeover proposal or engage in or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any takeover proposal.
The Transaction Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants for a transaction of this nature. The Transaction Agreement also contains customary mutual pre-closing covenants, including the obligation of Rowan and Ensco to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course of practice consistent with past practice and to refrain from taking certain specified actions without the consent of the other party.
The foregoing description of the Transaction and the Transaction Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Transaction Agreement, a copy of which is included in Exhibit 2.1 as filed with the Form 8-K dated October 9, 2018, and the full text of the Deed of Amendment No. 1 to the Transaction Agreement, a copy of which is included as Exhibit 2.1 as filed with the Form 8-K filed January 29, 2019. The Transaction Agreement, as amended, has been referenced to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Rowan or Ensco. In particular, the assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the Transaction Agreement are qualified by matters disclosed in certain of Rowan’s and Ensco’s filings with the SEC prior to the date of the Transaction Agreement and by information in confidential Disclosure Schedules provided by each of Rowan and Ensco to the other in connection with the signing of the Transaction Agreement. These confidential Disclosure Schedules contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties and certain covenants set forth in the Transaction Agreement. The representations, warranties and covenants are also subject to materiality qualifications contained in the Transaction Agreement that may differ from what may be viewed as material by investors. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Transaction Agreement were used for the purposes of allocating risk between Rowan and Ensco rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, the representations and warranties in the Transaction Agreement should not be relied on as characterizations of the actual state of facts about Rowan or Ensco. The Transaction Agreement should not be read alone, but should instead be read in conjunction with other information regarding the Company that is or will be contained in, or incorporated by reference into, the Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other documents that the Company files or furnishes with the SEC.
ARO Joint Venture
On November 21, 2016, Rowan and Saudi Aramco, through their subsidiaries, entered into a Shareholders’ Agreement to create a 50/50 joint venture to own, manage and operate offshore drilling units in Saudi Arabia. The new entity, ARO, was formed in May 2017 and commenced operations on October 17, 2017. For additional information see "ARO Joint Venture" in Note 1, Note 4 and Note 15 of the "Consolidated Financial Statements" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. The information discussed therein is incorporated by reference into this Part I, Item 1.
Drilling Fleet
We believe our fleet of ultra-deepwater drillships and high-specification and premium jack-ups is well positioned to serve the worldwide market. Many of our high specification jack-ups are also rated for operating in harsh environments. As of February 13, 2019, our drilling fleet consists of the following:

• | Four ultra-deepwater drillships;


• | Fifteen high-specification jack-up rigs; and


• | Six premium jack-up rigs.

We use the term “premium” to denote independent-leg cantilever jack-ups that can operate in at least 300 feet of water in benign environments and the term “high-specification” to describe premium jack-ups that also have a hook-load capacity of at least two million pounds.
Ultra-Deepwater Drillships – Our ultra-deepwater drillships are self-propelled vessels equipped with computer-controlled dynamic-positioning systems, which allow them to maintain position without anchors using their onboard propulsion and position reference systems. Drillships have greater variable loading capacity than semisubmersible rigs, enabling them to carry more supplies on board and, thus, making them better suited for drilling in deep water in remote locations. Our drillships are equipped with two drilling stations within a single derrick, allowing the drillships to perform preparatory activities off-line and potentially 
7

simultaneous drilling tasks during certain stages of drilling, subject to legal restrictions in various jurisdictions, enabling increased drilling efficiency particularly during the initial stages of a well. In addition, our drillships are equipped to drill in 12,000-foot water depths, are equipped with 2,500,000-pound hook-load capability and are capable of drilling HPHT wells to 40,000-foot depths. Each is equipped with two fully redundant blowout preventers, which are designed to prevent environmental and safety issues as well as significantly reduce non-productive time associated with repair and maintenance. In addition, each drillship is equipped with an active-heave compensating crane for deployment of subsea equipment simultaneous to drilling station operations. The sum total of these and other advanced features make the drillships very attractive to our customers.
Jack-up Rigs – Our jack-ups are capable of drilling wells to maximum depths ranging from 25,000 to 40,000 feet and in maximum water depths ranging from 300 to 550 feet, depending on rig size, location and outfitting. All of our high-specification rigs are equipped with or can readily accommodate the high-pressure circulation and pressure control equipment that is necessary for HPHT operations. Each of our jack-ups is designed with a hull that is fully equipped to serve as a drilling platform supported by three independently elevating legs. The rig is towed to the drilling site where the legs are lowered until they penetrate the ocean floor. After the legs are securely set, the hull raises itself out of the water up to the elevation required to drill the well using a self-contained rack and pinion system. 
Our three N-Class rigs are capable of drilling in water depths to 435 feet in harsh environments such as the North Sea depending on location and outfitting. The N-Class rigs, which were designed for operation in the highly regulated Norwegian sector of the North Sea, can be equipped to perform drilling and production operations simultaneously.
Three of our four Super Gorilla class rigs can be equipped for simultaneous drilling and production operations. They can operate in up to 450 feet of water in harsh environments such as the North Sea depending on location and outfitting. The Bob Palmer, our fourth Super Gorilla class rig, is an enhanced version of the Super Gorilla class jack-up designated as Super Gorilla XL. The Bob Palmer can operate in water depths up to 550 feet in benign environments like the US GOM and the Middle East or in water depths up to 450 feet in harsh environments such as the North Sea depending on location and outfitting.
Our three 240C class rigs were designed for HPHT drilling in water depths up to 400 feet in benign environments, depending on rig size, location and outfitting, and are equipped with a hook-load capacity of 2.5 million pounds. The rigs are also capable of operating in harsh environments at reduced water depths compared to their benign environment ratings.
Our four EXL class rigs enable HPHT drilling in water depths up to 350 feet and are equipped with a hook-load capacity of two million pounds.
In January 2018, we purchased two Super 116E class rigs. These are premium rigs capable of drilling in water depths up to 350 feet and are equipped with a hook-load capacity of 1.5 million pounds.
Our four remaining 116C class rigs are premium rigs capable of operating in water depths up to 300 feet in benign environments. One of these rigs is cold-stacked.
Our one remaining Gorilla class rig, the Rowan Gorilla IV, was designed as a heavier-duty class of jack-up rig capable of operating in water depths to 450 feet in benign environments. This rig is cold-stacked.
We sold the Scooter Yeargain and Hank Boswell to ARO in October 2018. This follows the previous sale of one premium and two high-specification jack-ups in October 2017 to ARO (see Note 1 and Note 15 of the "Consolidated Financial Statements" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report).
See Part I, Item 2, “Properties” of this Annual Report for additional information regarding our fleet.
Our operations are subject to many uncertainties and hazards. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of this Annual Report for additional information.
Contracts
Our drilling contracts generally provide for a fixed amount of compensation per day (day rate), and are either “well-to-well,” “multiple-well” or "fixed-term" generally ranging from one month to multiple years. Well-to-well contracts are typically cancellable by either party upon completion of drilling a well. Fixed-term contracts usually contain a termination provision such that either party may terminate if drilling operations are suspended for extended periods as a result of events of force majeure. While many fixed-term contracts are for relatively short periods of three months or less, others are for one or more years, and all can continue for periods longer than the original terms. Well-to-well contracts can be extended over multiple series of wells. Many drilling contracts contain renewal or extension provisions exercisable at the option of the customer at mutually agreeable or, in some cases, predetermined rates. Some of our drilling contracts provide for separate lump-sum payments for rig mobilization and 
8

demobilization. We record certain lump-sum fees and related expenses over the expected recognition period. We recognize reimbursement of certain costs as revenue and expenses at the time they are incurred. Our contracts for work generally provide for payment in USD except for amounts required by applicable law to be paid in the local currency or amounts required to meet local expenses.
A number of factors affect our ability to obtain contracts at profitable rates within a given region. Such factors, which are discussed further under “Competition” in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report and in “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report include the global economic climate, the price of oil and gas which can affect our customers' drilling budgets, over- supply of drilling units, location and availability of competitive equipment, the suitability of equipment for the project, comparative operating cost of the equipment, cost of securing competent drilling personnel and other competitive factors.  Profitability may also depend on receiving adequate compensation for the cost of moving equipment to drilling locations and capital investment needed for contract specific requirements.
During periods of weak demand and declining day rates, we have historically entered into contracts at lower rates in order to keep our rigs working. At times, however, market conditions have forced us to "warm-stack" rigs to reduce costs during extended periods between contracts. We currently have one ultra-deepwater drillship warm stacked. We have also cold-stacked certain of our idle older rigs to further reduce costs and have sold the following six such rigs over a period beginning in 2015: the Rowan Juneau, Rowan Alaska, Rowan Louisiana, Rowan Gorilla II, Rowan Gorilla III and Cecil Provine. All were sold under agreements that prohibit or limit their future use as drilling units. 
Our contract backlog was estimated to be approximately $634.9 million at February 13, 2019, up from approximately $456.2 million at February 13, 2018. Our backlog excludes ARO's revenue, but includes bareboat charter and related revenue for jack-ups leased to ARO. See "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report for further information with respect to our backlog.
Competition
The contract drilling industry is highly competitive, and success in obtaining contracts involves many factors, including supply and demand for drilling units, price, rig capability, operating and safety performance, local content requirements and reputation.
In the jack-up drilling market, we compete with numerous offshore drilling contractors that together have 451 marketed jack-up rigs worldwide as of February 13, 2019, with an additional 77 units that are under construction or on order. (We define marketed rigs as all delivered rigs that are not cold-stacked.) We estimate that 79 marketed jack-ups, or 18 percent of the world’s marketed jack-up fleet, are high-specification, including Rowan's 14 marketed high-specification rigs. 
At February 13, 2019, there were 196 marketed floaters (drillships and semi-submersibles) worldwide, with an additional estimated 31units that are under construction or on order. We estimate that 103 of these marketed floaters, or approximately 53 percent of the world’s marketed fleet, are capable of drilling in water depths of 10,000 feet or more, but only an estimated 36 floaters, or approximately 18 percent of the world's marketed fleet, have 2,500,000 pound hook-load capability and are equipped with dual blow-out preventers, which are key specifications valued by many deepwater customers.
A significant contributing factor to the softness in the offshore drilling market has been the influx of 263 newbuild jack-ups and 165 newbuild floaters delivered since early 2006. The addition of newbuild units, combined with numerous rigs having rolled off contracts in past months, has continued to support intense competition, putting downward pressure on day rates and utilization percentage in most regions and sectors. Of the approximately 77 jack-up rigs under construction worldwide scheduled for delivery through 2021 (25% of the currently utilized jack-up fleet of approximately 311 rigs), approximately 37 are considered high-specification (47% of the delivered and marketed high-specification fleet). Currently, there are approximately 44 competitive newbuild jack-up rigs scheduled for delivery during the remainder of 2019, and to our knowledge only one has a contract in place. There are approximately 31 floaters under construction worldwide for delivery through 2021 (25% of the currently utilized floater fleet of approximately 125 rigs). Following the negotiated delivery delays on several units into future years, there are approximately 16 competitive newbuild floaters scheduled for delivery during the remainder of 2019 and, to our knowledge, only one has a contract.
Based on the number of rigs as tabulated by IHS-Petrodata, we are the seventh largest offshore drilling contractor in the world and the sixth largest jack-up rig contractor. Based on market capitalization as of February 13, 2019, we are the third largest publicly traded pure play offshore driller. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources and may be more able to make technological improvements to existing equipment or replace equipment that becomes obsolete. In addition, those contractors with larger and more diversified drilling fleets may be better positioned to withstand unfavorable market conditions.
We market our drilling services to present and potential customers, including large international energy companies, smaller independent energy companies and government-owned or government-controlled energy companies. See “Management’s

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report for a discussion of current and anticipated industry conditions and their impact on our operations.
Governmental Regulation
Many aspects of our operations are subject to governmental regulation, including those relating to environmental protection and pollution control. In addition, governmental regulations concerning licensing and permitting, equipment specifications, training requirements or other matters could increase the costs of our operations and could reduce exploration activity in the areas in which we operate.
We could become liable for damages resulting from pollution which could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In many of our drilling contracts, we are indemnified for pollution, well damage and environmental damage, except in certain cases of pollution emanating from our drilling rigs. This indemnity includes costs associated with regaining control of a wild well, removal and disposal of pollutants, environmental remediation and claims by third parties for damages. However, such contractual indemnification provisions may not adequately protect us for several reasons such as (i) the contractual indemnity provisions may require us to assume certain types or amounts of the liability; (ii) our customers may not have the financial resources necessary to honor the contractual indemnity provisions; or (iii) the contractual indemnity provisions may be unenforceable under applicable law.
Our customers often require us to assume responsibility for pollution damages when we are at fault. We seek to limit our liability to certain types of exposures such as claims by third parties. We may also seek to limit our liability to a non-material monetary amount or an amount within the limits of our available insurance coverage. For example, a contract may provide that we will assume the first $50 million of costs related to an incident resulting in wellbore pollution due to our negligence, with the customer assuming responsibility for costs in excess of that amount. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to negotiate indemnities and/or limitation of liability provisions or that such indemnification and/or limitation of liability provisions can be enforced or will be sufficient. Our customers may challenge the validity or enforceability of the indemnity provision for several reasons, including but not limited to applicable law, judicial decisions, the language of the indemnity provision, reasons of public policy, degree of fault and/or the circumstances resulting in the pollution.
In the event of an incident resulting in wellbore pollution where we are liable for all or a portion of such event, the impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity would depend on the scope of the incident. In this instance, we would seek to enforce our legal rights, including the enforcement of the indemnity obligation, if available, and redress from all parties at fault. In addition, we maintain limited insurance for liability related to negative environmental impacts of a sudden and accidental pollution event, as described below. Such an event would adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows if both insurance and indemnity protection were unavailable or insufficient and the incident was significant.
The jurisdictions in which we operate have various regulations and requirements with which we must comply. For example, pursuant to the U.S. Clean Water Act, a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination ("NPDES") permit is required for discharges into the US GOM. The permit holder is the designated responsible party for any environmental impacts that occur in the event of the discharge of any unpermitted substance, including a fuel spill or oil leak from an offshore installation such as a mobile drilling unit or in the event of non-compliance with permit requirements. We operate in accordance with NPDES permit standards regardless of the holder. 
Pursuant to the U.K. Offshore Directive, we are required to have an approved Oil Pollution Emergency Plan ("OPEP") for each drilling unit operating in U.K. waters. The Offshore Directive also specifies additional regulations related to safety, licensing, environmental protection, emergency response and liability with which we comply. 
Additionally, pursuant to the IMO MARPOL 73/78, we are required to have a Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plan ("SOPEP") for each of our drilling units. Our SOPEP establishes detailed procedures for rapid and effective response to spill events that may occur as a result of our operations or those of the operator. This plan is reviewed in conjunction with the rig's emergency response manual and updated as necessary. Onboard drills are conducted periodically to maintain effectiveness of the plan, and each rig is outfitted with equipment to respond to minor spills. For operations anywhere in the world including in the U.S., our SOPEPs are subject to review and approval by Flag State, or a Recognized Organization acting on behalf of Flag State.
As the designated responsible party, an operator has the primary responsibility for spill response, including having contractual arrangements in place with emergency spill response organizations to supplement any onboard spill response equipment. Pursuant to our SOPEPs, we have certain resources and supplies onboard our drilling units to mitigate the impact of an incident until an emergency spill response organization can deploy its resources. However, we also have an agreement with an emergency spill response organization should we have an incident that exceeds the scope of our onboard spill response equipment. Our primary spill response provider in the U.S. specializes in helping industries prevent and clean up oil and other hydrocarbon spills. Our provider has represented it holds all necessary licenses, certifications and permits to respond to environmental emergencies in the 
10

US GOM and maintains contracts with other response resources and organizations outside the US GOM. We believe we have adequate equipment and third-party resources available to us to respond to an emergency spill; however, we can provide no assurance that adequate resources will be available. 
We are actively involved in various industry-led initiatives and work groups, including but not limited to those of the International Maritime Organization (a specialized agency of the United Nations), United States Coast Guard National Offshore Safety Advisory Committee, American Petroleum Institute, the International Association of Drilling Contractors, the Oil Companies International Marine Forum, the Center for Offshore Safety and the British Rig Owners Association, which are intended to improve safety and protection of the environment.
Oil and gas operations in the US GOM and in many of the other jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to regulation with respect to well design, casing and cementing and well control procedures, as well as rules requiring operators to systematically identify risks and establish safeguards against those risks through a comprehensive SEMS. Any serious oil and gas industry related events heighten governmental and environmental concerns and may lead to legislative proposals being introduced which may materially limit or prohibit offshore drilling in certain areas. New regulations may be implemented, including rules regarding drilling systems and equipment, such as blowout preventer and well-control systems and lifesaving systems, as well as rules regarding employee training, engaging personnel in safety management and requiring third-party audits of SEMS programs.
Regulatory compliance has and may continue to materially impact our capital expenditures and earnings, particularly in the event of an environmental incident. Given the state-of-the-art design of our drillships and high specification nature of the majority of our jack-up fleet, we believe we are well positioned competitively to our peers to be able to comply with current and future governmental regulations. 
Insurance
We maintain insurance coverage for damage to our drilling rigs, third-party liability, workers’ compensation and employers’ liability, sudden and accidental pollution and other types of loss or damage. Our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and self-insured retentions which must be met prior to any recovery. Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and we can provide no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.
Our current insurance policies provide coverage for loss or damage to our fleet of drilling rigs on an agreed value basis (which varies by unit) subject to a deductible of either $25 million or $15 million per occurrence, depending on the unit's geographic location. This coverage does not include damage to our rigs arising from a US GOM named windstorm, for which we are self-insured.
We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage for liability associated with negative environmental impacts of a sudden and accidental pollution event, third-party liability, employers’ liability (including Jones Act liability) and automobile liability, and these policies are subject to various exclusions, deductibles and underlying limits. In addition, we maintain excess liability coverage with an annual aggregate limit of $700 million subject to a self-insured retention of $10 million except for liabilities (including removal of wreck) arising out of a US GOM named windstorm, which are subject to a self-insured retention of $200 million.
Our rig physical damage and liability insurance renews each June. We can provide no assurance we will be able to secure coverage of a similar nature with similar limits at comparable costs upon renewal.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 3,300 employees worldwide, compared to approximately 2,800 and 2,900 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and approximately 530 independent contractors. Certain of our employees and contractors in various regions, such as Trinidad and Norway, are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining or similar agreements, which are subject to periodic renegotiation. We consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
Customers
In 2018, Saudi Aramco, Anadarko, ARO Drilling, and BP Trinidad and Tobago accounted for 28%, 14%, 14%, and 10%, respectively, of consolidated revenue. Saudi Aramco and BP Trinidad and Tobago revenue was derived from our Jack-ups segment, Anadarko revenue was derived from our Deepwater segment and ARO Drilling revenue was derived from our Jack-ups segment as well as revenue for transition services provided to ARO which is included in Unallocated and other.
