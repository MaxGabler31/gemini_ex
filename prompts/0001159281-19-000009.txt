Item 1. Business
THE COMPANY
We are a corporation that was formed under the laws of the State of Maryland in 2001. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 284 senior living communities with 32,016 living units located in 32 states, including 255 primarily independent and assisted living communities with 29,511 living units and 29 skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, with 2,505 living units. As of December 31, 2018, we owned and operated 20 of these senior living communities (2,108 living units), we leased and operated 188 of these senior living communities (20,142 living units) and we managed 76 of these senior living communities (9,766 living units). Our 284 senior living communities included 10,895 independent living apartments, 16,389 assisted living suites and 4,732 SNF units. The foregoing numbers exclude living units categorized as out of service.
As of December 31, 2018, we leased from Senior Housing Properties Trust or its subsidiaries, or SNH, 184 senior living communities pursuant to five long term leases and managed 76 senior living communities for the account of SNH pursuant to long term management agreements. Our Independent Directors and SNH’s independent trustees are currently evaluating our lease and management arrangements with SNH. As a result, there may be agreed changes to our arrangements with SNH in the future. We cannot be sure that any changes to our arrangements with SNH will be agreed to or occur. For more information about our leases and management agreements with SNH, see “Properties—Our Leases and Management Agreements with SNH” in Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Our present business plan contemplates the operation of owned, managed and leased independent and assisted senior living communities. Some of our senior living communities provide more than one type of service in a single building or campus.
Independent Living Communities. Independent living communities provide high levels of privacy to residents and require residents to be capable of relatively high degrees of independence. An independent living apartment usually bundles several non-healthcare services as part of a regular monthly charge. For example, the base charge may include one or two meals per day in a central dining room, weekly maid service or social director services. Additional non-healthcare services are generally available from staff employees on a fee for service basis. In some independent living communities, separate parts of the community are dedicated to assisted living or nursing services. As of December 31, 2018, our operations included 10,895 independent living apartments in 97 communities.
Assisted Living Communities. Assisted living communities are typically comprised of one bedroom units which include private bathrooms and efficiency kitchens. Services bundled within one charge usually include three meals per day in a central dining room, daily housekeeping, laundry, medical reminders and 24-hour availability of assistance with the activities of daily living such as dressing and bathing. Professional nursing and healthcare services are usually available at the community as requested or at regularly scheduled times. We may also provide Alzheimer or memory care services at our assisted living communities. As of December 31, 2018, our operations included 16,389 assisted living suites in 230 communities.
Skilled Nursing Facilities. SNFs generally provide extensive nursing and healthcare services similar to those available in hospitals, without the high costs associated with operating theaters, emergency rooms or intensive care units. A typical purpose built SNF generally includes one or two beds per room with a separate bathroom in each room and shared dining facilities. SNFs are staffed by licensed nursing professionals 24 hours per day. As of December 31, 2018, our operations included 4,732 SNF units in 69 communities.
Our principal executive offices are located at 400 Centre Street, Newton, Massachusetts 02458, and our telephone number is (617) 796-8387.
OUR GROWTH STRATEGY 
We believe that the aging of the U.S. population will increase demand for senior living communities and services. We plan to profit from this demand by: (1) improving the profitability of our existing operations by increasing revenues and improving operating margins and operating communities that provide high quality services to residents who pay with private resources; (2) entering arrangements for us to operate additional senior living communities; (3) growing our ancillary services to complement existing senior living operations, including increasing our offerings of outpatient therapy services, including physical, occupational, speech and other specialized therapy services, as well as home healthcare and concierge services to our 
1

residents and to seniors living outside of our communities; and (4) continuing to develop public awareness of the Five Star Senior Living brand through various marketing efforts and initiatives.
We seek to improve the profitability of our existing senior living operations by increasing revenues through increases in occupancy and in the rates we charge, by improving our operating margins, by managing our expenses prudently and otherwise improving our operating efficiencies and by operating communities that provide high quality services to residents who pay with private resources. We have also sought to improve profitability through continued strategic capital investments at our senior living communities and by investing and developing our staff and working with our service providers to increase the desirability and competitiveness of our senior living communities. In addition to routine renovations and upgrades at our senior living communities, we have sought to expand our senior living communities when and as we believed demand supported opportunities for us to pursue possible additional revenues at our existing senior living communities. Since January 1, 2016, we have invested $96.3 million in capital improvements in our senior living communities, net of amounts we sold to SNH for increased annual minimum rent. We also seek to grow our business by entering additional long term operating arrangements for senior living communities where residents’ private resources account for all or a large majority of revenues. Since January 1, 2016, we have commenced leasing nine senior living communities, including seven senior living communities which we sold to SNH in June 2016 and simultaneously began leasing from SNH, and we have begun managing 16 senior living communities, including six senior living communities which we sold to SNH in December 2017, January 2018 and February 2018 and simultaneously began managing for the account of SNH. For more information about these sale transactions, see “—Our Dispositions” below. For more information about our management and leasing arrangements with SNH, see “Properties—Our SNH Leases and Management Agreements with SNH” in Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Through our ancillary services, we offer skilled rehabilitation services for short term inpatient stays, such as after joint replacement surgery; home healthcare in certain of our independent living and assisted living communities; outpatient rehabilitation for people of all ages; long term skilled nursing care by highly trained professionals; and concierge services. The therapy services we offer include physical, occupational, speech and other specialized therapy services. The home health services we provide include nursing, physical, occupational, speech and other specialized therapy services, home health aide services, and social services, as needed. In addition, we offer personalized concierge services to accommodate our residents' specific lifestyle and needs. Concierge services include personal shopping, companion services, enhanced transportation, bedtime assistance, and personalized dining and nutrition planning, delivery and consultation. By providing residents with a range of service options as their needs change, we provide greater continuity of care, which we believe may encourage our customers to maintain residency with us for a longer period of time. Since January 1, 2016, we have opened 49 rehabilitation and wellness outpatient clinics. We also expanded our rehabilitation and wellness services to senior living communities outside of our current operations. Along with this expansion initiative, in July 2017, our rehabilitation and wellness division rebranded itself as Ageility Physical Therapy Solutions.
We also continue to develop public awareness of the Five Star Senior Living brand through various marketing initiatives that we believe differentiate us from other senior living operators. For example, because an enjoyable dining experience is often a top priority for senior living community residents, in recent years we believe that we redefined the dining experience offered at our senior living communities by partnering with a celebrity chef and creating the “Five Star Culinary Institute” where the chefs at our senior living communities receive training. We also introduced “Lifestyle360”, a wellness program focused on five dimensions of wellness (social, intellectual, spiritual, emotional and physical). We believe these programs, among others, enhance the appeal of our senior living communities among current and prospective residents and their families, and provide us with an opportunity to improve our operating performance. Our corporate name change in 2017 further reflects our focus on not just providing high quality clinical care but also providing hospitality and other services to enhance the lifestyle of our residents.
We currently expect that our expansion activities will be focused on internal growth from our existing senior living communities and the healthcare services that we may provide and not from our acquisition of senior living communities, although we may from time to time acquire additional senior living communities.
OUR DISPOSITIONS
We continually monitor our portfolio of senior living communities and our other assets, and we dispose of, or change our method of operating (e.g., from ownership to leasing or managing) certain of our senior living communities when we determine it is in our best interest to do so and are able to reach agreement with the other applicable party for the change. Since January 1, 2016, we have sold, or participated in the sale of, 16 senior living communities, including seven senior living communities that we sold to SNH in June 2016 and simultaneously leased back from SNH under a long term lease agreement. These 16 senior living communities also include six senior living communities that we sold to SNH and simultaneously began 
2

managing for SNH pursuant to a transaction agreement we entered with SNH in November 2017 and management and pooling agreements. For more information about our dispositions, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information about our management and pooling and our leasing arrangements with SNH, see “Properties—Our Leases and Management Agreements with SNH” in Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We also regularly sell certain capital improvements to SNH that we make to our senior living communities that we lease from SNH. We pay increased annual rent to SNH in accordance with the terms of our leases with SNH as a result of these sales. We expect to continue to make similar capital improvement sales to SNH in the future; however, SNH is not obligated to purchase these capital improvements from us.
FINANCING SOURCES
On December 18, 2018, we amended the agreement, or our credit agreement, governing our then $100.0 million secured revolving credit facility, or our credit facility. As a result of the amendment to our credit agreement, which is now fully drawn and does not permit further borrowings, the aggregate amount of the commitments under our credit facility was reduced to $54.0 million from $100.0 million, and the stated maturity date of our credit facility was changed to June 28, 2019 from February 24, 2020. In addition, the amendment eliminated our options to extend the maturity date of our credit facility for two, one year periods, as well as request an increase in the aggregate amount of the commitments under our credit facility. The amendment also removed certain financial covenants we were previously required to comply with, including the leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and the tangible net worth covenant. Certain other covenants and related definitions, among other provisions, included in our credit agreement were also modified pursuant to the amendment. Our credit facility, which is available for general business purposes, requires us to pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our credit facility at a rate based on, at our option, LIBOR or a base rate, plus a premium, per annum, and we are also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of 0.35% per annum on the unused part of the available borrowings under our credit facility. Our credit facility is secured by real estate mortgages on 10 senior living communities with a combined 1,219 living units owned by our guarantor subsidiaries and our guarantor subsidiaries’ accounts receivable and related collateral. We are currently evaluating options to refinance our credit facility. We cannot be sure that we will obtain any renewed or restructured credit facility, and our ability to do so will likely depend on the lenders’ belief that our prospects, operating leverage and expected future operating results will permit us to continue as a going concern and to fund our operations, capital investments and debt service and other obligations. For more information about our credit facility, see Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
We may also place mortgages on properties we own, as well as seek to obtain other additional sources of financing in the future, including term debt or issuing equity or debt securities.
OPERATING STRUCTURE
We have five operating divisions. Four of these divisions are responsible for senior living communities located in specified geographic regions, with each region's management being responsible for independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing units within its specified region. Each of our senior living divisions is headed by a divisional vice president with extensive experience in the senior living industry, and is managed from our regional offices. Our regional offices are responsible for our senior living communities located within a specified geographic region and are headed by regional directors of operations that have extensive experience in the senior living industry. Each regional office is typically supported by a clinical or wellness director, a regional accounts manager, a human resources specialist, a food services specialist and a sales and marketing specialist. Regional office staff members are responsible for all of our senior living community operations, including:

• | resident services;


• | Medicare and Medicaid billing;


• | sales and marketing;


• | hiring of community personnel;


• | compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements; and


• | supporting our development and acquisition plans within their region.

3

Our fifth division is responsible for the provision of rehabilitation and therapy services and is headed by a vice president within our corporate office who has extensive experience in rehabilitation services, and who is supported by a network of divisional and regional directors of rehabilitation services who are assigned to specified geographic regions.
Our corporate headquarters staff is responsible for corporate level systems, policies and procedures, such as:

• | company wide policies and procedures;


• | human resources;


• | information technology services;


• | private pay billing for our independent and assisted living communities;


• | licensing and certification maintenance;


• | legal services and regulatory compliance;


• | central purchasing;


• | budgeting and supervision of maintenance and capital expenditures;


• | implementation of our growth strategy; and


• | accounting, auditing and finance functions, including operations, budgeting, certain accounts receivable and collections functions, accounts payable, payroll, tax and financial reporting.

As described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K, we have a business management agreement with The RMR Group LLC, or RMR LLC, pursuant to which RMR LLC provides to us certain business management services, including services related to compliance with various laws and rules applicable to our status as a publicly owned company, including our internal audit function, capital markets and financing activities and investor relations.
STAFFING
Independent and Assisted Living Community Staffing. Each of our independent and assisted living communities has an executive director that is responsible for the day to day operations of the applicable community, including quality of care, resident services, sales and marketing, financial performance and staff supervision, as applicable. The executive director is supported by department managers who oversee the care and service of our residents, a wellness director who is responsible for coordinating the services necessary to meet the care needs of our residents and a sales director who is responsible for sales and promoting our services and brand, as applicable. These communities also typically have a dining services coordinator, an activities coordinator and a property maintenance coordinator.
Skilled Nursing Facility Staffing. Each of our SNFs is managed by a state licensed administrator who is supported by other professional personnel, including a director of nursing, an activities director, a marketing director, a social services director, a business office manager and physical, occupational and speech therapists. Our directors of nursing are state licensed nurses who supervise our registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and nursing assistants. Staff size and composition vary among our SNFs depending on the size and occupancy of, and the type of care provided at, the applicable SNF. Our SNFs also contract with physicians who provide certain administrative clinical oversight services.
EMPLOYEES

As of February 27, 2019, we had approximately 24,700 employees, including approximately 18,000 full time equivalents. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND REIMBURSEMENT
The senior living and healthcare industries are subject to extensive, frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations vary by jurisdiction but may address, among other things, licensure, personnel training, staffing ratios, types and quality of medical care, physical facility requirements, government healthcare program participation, fraud and abuse, payments for patient services and patient records.
We are subject to, and our operations must comply with, these laws and regulations. From time to time, our communities receive notices from federal, state and local agencies regarding noncompliance with such requirements. Upon receipt of these notices, we review them for correctness and, based on our review, we either take corrective action or contest the allegation of noncompliance. When corrective action is required, we work with the relevant agency to address and remediate 
4

any violations. Challenging and appealing any notices or allegations of noncompliance require the expenditure of significant legal fees and management attention. Any adverse determination concerning any of our licenses or eligibility for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement, any penalties, repayments or sanctions, and the increasing costs of required compliance with applicable laws may adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Also, adverse findings with regard to any one of our communities may have an adverse impact on our licensing and ability to operate and attract residents to other communities.

The healthcare industry depends significantly upon federal and state programs for revenues and, as a result, is affected by the budgetary policies of both the federal and state governments. Reimbursements under the Medicare and Medicaid programs for skilled nursing, physical therapy and rehabilitation and wellness services provided operating revenues at our outpatient clinics and some of our senior living communities (principally our SNFs). We derived approximately 23.3% and 22.9% of our consolidated senior living revenues from Medicare and Medicaid programs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
In addition to existing government regulation, we are aware of numerous healthcare regulatory initiatives on the federal, state and local levels, which may affect our business operations if implemented.
Independent Living Communities. Government benefits are not generally available for services at independent living communities, and residents in those communities use private resources to pay for their living units and the services they receive. The rates in these communities are determined by local market conditions and operating costs. However, a number of federal Supplemental Security Income program benefits pay housing costs for elderly or disabled recipients to live in these types of residential communities. The Social Security Act requires states to certify that they will establish and enforce standards for any category of group living arrangement in which a significant number of Supplemental Security Income recipients reside or are likely to reside. Categories of living arrangements that may be subject to these state standards include independent living communities and assisted living communities. Because independent living communities usually offer common dining facilities, in many jurisdictions they are required to obtain licenses applicable to food service establishments in addition to complying with land use and life safety requirements. In addition, in some states, state or county health departments, social service agencies and/or offices on aging have jurisdiction over group residential communities for seniors and license independent living communities. To the extent that independent living communities include units to which assisted living or nursing services are provided, these units are subject to applicable state licensing regulations. If the communities receive Medicaid or Medicare funds, they are subject to certification standards and Conditions of Participation. In some states, insurance or consumer protection agencies regulate independent living communities in which residents pay entrance fees or prepay for services.
Assisted Living Communities. A majority of states provide or are approved to provide Medicaid payments for personal care and medical services to some residents in licensed assisted living communities under waivers granted by or under Medicaid state plans approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. State Medicaid programs control costs for assisted living and other home and community based services by various means such as restrictive financial and functional eligibility standards, enrollment limits and waiting lists. Because rates paid to assisted living community operators are generally lower than rates paid to SNF operators, some states use Medicaid funding of assisted living as a means of lowering the cost of services for residents who may not need the higher level of health services provided in SNFs. States that administer Medicaid programs for services in assisted living communities are responsible for monitoring the services at, and physical conditions of, the participating communities.
As a result of the large number of states using Medicaid funds to purchase services at assisted living communities and the growth of assisted living in recent years, states have adopted licensing standards applicable to assisted living communities. According to the National Center for Assisted Living and the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, all states regulate assisted living and residential care communities, although states do not use a uniform approach. Most state licensing standards apply to assisted living communities regardless of whether they accept Medicaid funding. Also, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a few states require certificates of need, or CONs, from state health planning authorities before new assisted living communities may be developed. Based on our analysis of recent economic and regulatory trends, we believe that assisted living communities that become dependent upon Medicaid or other government payments for a majority of their revenues may decline in value because Medicaid and other public rates may fail to keep up with increasing costs. We also believe that assisted living communities located in states that adopt CON requirements or other limitations on the development of new assisted living communities may increase in value because those limitations may help ensure higher nongovernment rates and reduced competition.
HHS, the Senate Special Committee on Aging and the Government Accountability Office, or the GAO, have studied and reported on the development of assisted living and its role in the continuum of long term care and as an alternative to SNFs. Since 2003, CMS has commenced a series of actions to increase its oversight of state quality assurance programs for 
5

assisted living communities and has provided guidance and technical assistance to states to improve their ability to monitor and improve the quality of services paid for through Medicaid waiver programs.
CMS is encouraging state Medicaid programs to expand their use of home and community based services as alternatives to institutional services, pursuant to provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, or the DRA, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, and other authorities, through the use of several programs. One such program, the Community First Choice Option, or the CFC Option, grants states that choose to participate in the program a 6% increase in federal matching payments for related medical assistance expenditures. According to CMS, as of January 2019, eight states had approved CFC Option programs. We are unable to predict the effect of the implementation of the CFC Option and other similar programs, but their impact may be adverse and material to our operations and our future financial results of operations.
Skilled Nursing Facilities—Medicare Reimbursement. A majority of all SNF revenues in the United States comes from publicly funded programs. According to CMS, Medicaid is the largest source of public funding for SNFs, followed by Medicare. In 2016, approximately 31% of SNF and continuing care retirement community revenues came from Medicaid and 23% from Medicare. 
SNFs are highly regulated businesses. The federal and state governments regularly monitor the quality of care provided at SNFs. State health departments conduct surveys of resident care and inspect the physical condition of SNF properties. These periodic inspections and occasional changes in life safety and physical plant requirements sometimes require SNF operators to make significant capital improvements. These mandated capital improvements have usually resulted in Medicare and Medicaid rate adjustments, albeit on the basis of amortization of expenditures over the expected useful lives of the improvements. 
Under the Medicare SNF prospective payment system, or SNF PPS, capital costs are part of the prospective rate and are not community specific. The SNF PPS and other recent legislative and regulatory actions with respect to state Medicaid rates limit the reimbursement levels for some SNF services. At the same time, federal and state enforcement agencies have increased oversight of SNFs, making licensing and certification of these communities more rigorous.
CMS implemented the SNF PPS pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Under the SNF PPS, SNFs receive a fixed payment for each day of care provided to residents who are Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare SNF PPS payments cover substantially all services provided to Medicare residents in SNFs, including ancillary services such as rehabilitation services. Currently, the SNF PPS requires SNFs to assign each resident to a care group depending on that resident’s medical characteristics and service needs using a resident assessment instrument called the Minimum Data Set 3.0. These care groups are known as Resource Utilization Groups, or RUGs, and CMS establishes a per diem payment rate for each RUG.
CMS updates SNF PPS payments for each year by a market basket update to account for inflation and periodically implements changes to the RUG categories and payment rates. Effective October 2010, CMS adopted rules that implemented a new SNF PPS case mix classification system known as RUG-IV. Following the implementation of RUG-IV, Medicare billing increased nationally, partially because of the unexpectedly large proportion of patients grouped in the highest paying RUG therapy categories. CMS did not intend for the implementation of RUG-IV to increase Medicare billing. In 2011, CMS adopted a final rule designed to recalibrate the Medicare SNF PPS, which resulted in a reduction in aggregate Medicare payments for SNFs by approximately 11.1%, or $3.87 billion, in federal fiscal year 2012. Since federal fiscal year 2012, the ACA has also reduced SNF PPS payments for each year by a productivity adjustment based on national economic productivity statistics.
In subsequent years, CMS slightly increased the Medicare SNF PPS rates and estimated that those rates would increase payments to SNFs by an aggregate of approximately 1.8% for federal fiscal year 2013, 1.3% for federal fiscal year 2014, 2.0% for federal fiscal year 2015, 1.2% for federal fiscal year 2016, 2.4% for federal fiscal year 2017, and 1% for federal fiscal year 2018. On July 31, 2018, CMS issued the latest SNF prospective payment system final rule for federal fiscal year 2019, which CMS estimates will increase Medicare payments to SNFs by approximately $820 million for federal fiscal year 2019, or 2.4%, compared to federal fiscal year 2018, as mandated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. It is unclear whether these adjustments in Medicare rates will compensate for the increased costs we may incur for services to our residents whose services are paid for by Medicare. 
On July 31, 2018, CMS finalized its proposal to replace the RUG-IV model, with a revised case-mix methodology called the Patient-Driven Payment Model, or PDPM, which will become effective October 1, 2019. The PDPM focuses on clinically relevant factors, rather than volume-based payment, by using ICD-10 diagnosis codes and other patient characteristics as the basis for patient classification. PDPM will eliminate the need for SNFs to use Minimum Data Set 3.0 to 
6

assign residents to a care group. CMS estimates that paperwork simplification related to patient assessments will reduce reporting burdens for SNFs by approximately $2.0 billion over 10 years. 
The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, enacted in February 2012, incrementally reduced the SNF reimbursement rate for Medicare bad debt from 100% to 65% by federal fiscal year 2015 for beneficiaries dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Because a majority of SNF bad debt has historically been related to dual eligible beneficiaries, this rule has a substantial negative effect on SNFs, including some that we operate. The same law also reduced the SNF Medicare bad debt reimbursement rate for Medicare beneficiaries not eligible for Medicaid from 70% to 65% in federal fiscal year 2013 and going forward.

The Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 allow for automatic reductions in federal spending by means of a process called sequestration, which reduces Medicare payment rates by 2.0% through 2023. In 2014 and 2015, Congress approved two additional one year extensions of Medicare sequestration, through 2025. Medicaid is exempt from the automatic reductions, as are certain Medicare benefits. The automatic 2.0% payment cuts took effect in April 2013 and had an adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Subsequent legislation appears to have modified some aspects of the sequestration process, but at this time it is unclear what impact this legislation may have on Medicare payments we receive. Any future reductions in Medicare payment rates could be adverse and material to our operations and financial results. 
We are unable to predict the impact of on us of these or other recent legislative or regulatory actions or proposed actions with respect to Medicare rates received by our facilities.

Skilled Nursing Facilities - Medicaid Reimbursement. Although Medicaid is exempt from the sequestration process described above, some of the states in which we operate either have not raised Medicaid rates by amounts sufficient to offset increasing costs or have frozen or reduced, or are expected to freeze or reduce, Medicaid rates. Some states are expanding their use of managed care, partly to control Medicaid program costs. According to a report by CMS Office of the Actuary in February 2018, Medicaid enrollment is estimated to have increased 11.9% in 2014, 4.9% in 2015, 3.0% in 2016, and 2.0% in 2017, due primarily to the expansion in Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, which began in 2014. In 2018, Medicaid enrollment was flat (-.06%) and is projected to modestly increase 0.9% in 2019, which moderation in growth we believe is due to the tapering of ACA-related Medicaid expansion, a strong economy, and enhanced eligibility verification systems.
In January 2018, CMS issued a letter to State Medicaid Directors announcing that CMS would support state efforts to test incentives that make participation in work or other community engagement a requirement for continued Medicaid eligibility for non-elderly, non-pregnant adults. States would be required to have exemptions for individuals who are classified as “disabled” for Medicaid eligibility purposes, as well those with acute medical conditions or medical frailty that would prevent them from complying with the work requirement. As of January 2019, Arkansas, Kentucky and Indiana have implemented work requirements for adults receiving Medicaid; New Hampshire and Indiana have received CMS approval and are expected to implement their work requirements during 2019. In addition, Arizona, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Utah and Wisconsin have submitted requests for Medicaid work requirements. The implementation of work requirements may reduce the availability of Medicaid coverage within our patient population.
Some of the states in which we operate either have not raised Medicaid rates by amounts sufficient to offset increasing costs or have frozen or reduced, or are expected to freeze or reduce Medicaid rates. Effective June 30, 2011, Congress ended certain temporary increases in federal payments to states for Medicaid programs that had been in effect since 2008. We expect the ending of these temporary federal payments, combined with other state budgetary pressures, to result in continued challenging state fiscal conditions, particularly in those states that are not participating in Medicaid expansion. As a result, some state budget deficits may increase, and certain states may continue to reduce Medicaid payments to healthcare providers like us as part of an effort to balance their budgets. These state level cuts have the potential to negatively impact our revenue from Medicaid sources.
We are unable to predict the impact on us of these or other recent legislative and regulatory actions or proposed actions with respect to state Medicaid rates, the federal payments to states for Medicaid programs, Medicaid program design and Medicaid eligibility standards.
Skilled Nursing Facilities – Provider Reimbursement. The outpatient therapy revenue received by our providers is tied to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, or MPFS, which has historically been subject to limitations on the amount of therapy services that can be provided, as well as limitations on annual cost growth. 
7

In 2006, Medicare payments for outpatient therapies became subject to payment limits. The DRA created an exception process under which beneficiaries could request an exception from the cap and be granted the amount of services deemed medically necessary by Medicare. In April 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, extended the Medicare outpatient therapy cap exception process through March 2015, postponing the implementation of firm limits on Medicare payments for outpatient therapies. In April 2015, Congress passed the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, which extended the outpatient therapy cap exceptions process from March 2015 through December 2017, further postponing the implementation of strict limits on Medicare payments for outpatient therapies. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 permanently repealed the caps, effective January 1, 2018.
In October 2016, CMS issued a final rule to implement the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System, or MIPS, and Advanced Alternative Payment Models, or APMs, which together CMS calls the Quality Payment Program.  These reforms were mandated under MACRA and replace the Sustainable Growth Rate, or SGR, methodology for calculating updates to the MPFS. Starting in 2019, providers may be subject to either MIPS payment adjustments or APM incentive payments. MIPS consolidates the various CMS incentive and quality programs into a single reporting mechanism. Providers will receive either incentive payments or reimbursement cuts based on their compliance with MIPS requirements and their performance against a mean and median threshold of all MIPS eligible providers. APMs are innovative models approved by CMS for paying healthcare providers for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries that draw on existing programs, such as the bundled payment and shared savings models. 
In addition, under MACRA, there were and will be MPFS conversion factor updates of 0.0% from January 2015 through June 2015, 0.5% from July 2015 through December 2015, and 0.5% each year from 2016 through 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 reduced the conversion factor for 2019 from 0.5% to 0.25%. For 2020 through 2025, the conversion factor will be further reduced to 0.0%.
Our Medicare Part B outpatient therapy provider revenue rates are tied to the MPFS and may be affected by these modifications; however, we are unable to predict the impact of these modifications on the Medicare rates received by our providers.
Skilled Nursing Facilities — Quality Improvement, Pay-for-Performance and Value-Based Purchasing Initiatives. In addition to the reimbursement and rate changes discussed above, payments to SNFs will be increasingly determined by the quality of care provided. The federal government has enhanced its focus on developing and imposing quality-related regulations, standards and programs to improve the quality of care provided at SNFs and to better align payment to quality outcomes. As mandated by MACRA, PAMA and the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014, or the IMPACT Act, CMS established the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program and the SNF Quality Reporting Program to achieve these goals. 
The IMPACT Act established the SNF Quality Reporting Program, under which SNFs are required to report certain quality measures and resource use measures in a standardized and interoperable format and to report certain patient assessment data in such a format. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2018, SNFs that failed to comply with the reporting requirements by the established times are subject to a 2.0% reduction in their Medicare payment rates for that fiscal year. Beginning in October 2018, SNF Quality Reporting Program data is publicly available on CMS’ Nursing Home Compare website.
PAMA established the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program, under which HHS will assess SNFs based on hospital readmissions and make these assessments available to the public. In the SNF PPS final rule for fiscal year 2016, CMS adopted a 30 day all-cause, all-condition hospital readmission measure for SNFs, which was replaced with an all-condition, risk-adjusted potentially preventable hospital readmission rate measure in the SNF PPS final rule for fiscal year 2017. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2019, Medicare payment rates will be partially based on SNFs’ performance scores on this measure. The 2019 federal fiscal year update established baseline and performance periods for federal fiscal year 2021, adjusted SNF Value-Based Purchasing scoring methodology, and established an extraordinary circumstances exception policy. To fund the program, CMS will reduce Medicare payments to all SNFs by 2.0% through a withhold mechanism starting in October 2018 and then redistribute between 50% and 70% of the withheld payments as incentive payments to those SNFs with the highest rankings on this measure. CMS estimates that the federal fiscal year 2019 changes to the SNF VBP program will decrease payments to SNFs by an aggregate of approximately $211 million, compared to federal fiscal year 2018. 

In August 2015, CMS announced that it would conduct the second phase of another SNF quality improvement program, the Initiative to Reduce Avoidable Hospitalizations Among Nursing Facility Residents, a pilot program first announced in 2012, which will be continued in partnership with selected organizations from October 2016 to October 2020. In this phase of the initiative, participants will test whether a new payment model for SNFs and practitioners, together with clinical and educational interventions that participants are currently implementing, will further reduce avoidable 
8

hospitalizations, lower combined Medicare and Medicaid spending and improve the quality of care received by long stay SNF residents. As of January 2019, six organizations had cooperative agreements with CMS to implement this phase of the initiative, and over 250 long term care facilities were selected to participate. 
As these quality improvement initiatives increase in size and scope, the federal government will likely monitor the impact of these programs more closely. We are unable to predict the impact of these quality improvement initiatives on our Medicare reimbursement rates or the cost of our SNFs’ operations. 
Other legislative proposals introduced in Congress, proposed by federal or state agencies or under consideration by some state governments include the option of block grants for states rather than federal matching money for certain state Medicaid services, laws authorizing or directing Medicare to negotiate rate reductions for prescription drugs, additional Medicare and Medicaid enforcement procedures and federal and state cost containment measures, such as freezing Medicare or Medicaid SNF payment rates at their current levels and reducing or eliminating annual Medicare or Medicaid inflation allowances or gradually reducing rates for SNFs. We cannot estimate the type or magnitude of the potential Medicare and Medicaid policy changes, rate reductions or other changes and the impact on us of the possible failure of these programs to increase rates to match our increasing expenses, but they may be material to and adversely affect our future results of operations. 
Skilled Nursing Facilities – Conditions of Participation. CMS maintains and enforces Conditions of Participation that healthcare organizations must meet in order to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These standards are designed to improve quality of care and protect the health and safety of beneficiaries. Through the Conditions of Participation, CMS is able to require certain quality standards protocols, including most recently, requiring SNFs to implement a quality assurance and performance improvement program.
In September 2016, CMS released a final rule to comprehensively update the Conditions of Participation for long term care facilities that participate in Medicare and Medicaid, such as our SNFs. The final rule, which went into effect beginning in November 2016, institutes a broad range of new requirements, some of which stem from statutory modifications under the ACA and the IMPACT Act. In particular, the final rule requires our SNFs, in a multi-phased approach over the next few years, to: train staff on care for residents with dementia and on abuse prevention; consider residents’ health needs when making decisions about the kinds and levels of staffing; ensure that staff have the appropriate skills and competencies to provide individualized, resident centered care; augment care planning activities, including considering residents’ goals and preferences and, on discharge, giving residents necessary follow up information and improving communication with receiving facilities or services; permit dietitians and therapy providers to write orders under certain circumstances; meet heightened food and nutrition services requirements; implement an updated infection prevention and control program, including requiring each of our SNFs to designate an infection prevention and control officer; and strengthen residents’ rights. In addition, the final rule requires our SNFs to: alter their staffing levels and competencies based on the results of mandated facility assessments; develop, implement and maintain a compliance and ethics program and a quality assurance and performance improvement program; and implement new practices surrounding the preparation and implementation of care plans and discharge summaries, among other new requirements. These requirements will increase the cost of operations for long term care facilities that participate in Medicare and Medicaid, including our SNFs. Specifically, CMS estimated in the final rule that the cost of complying with all of the new requirements per facility would be approximately $62,900 in the first year, and approximately $55,000 each year thereafter. However, we believe new requirements often cost considerably more than CMS estimates.
Skilled Nursing Facilities—Survey and Enforcement. Pursuant to the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987, Congress enacted major reforms to federal and state regulatory systems for SNFs that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Since then, the GAO has reported that, although much progress has been made, substantial problems remain in the effectiveness of federal and state regulatory activities. The HHS Office of Inspector General, or the OIG, has issued several reports concerning quality of care and billing practices in SNFs, and the GAO has issued several reports recommending that CMS and states strengthen their compliance and enforcement practices, including federal oversight of state actions and to ensure that SNFs provide adequate care and states act more consistently. Moreover, in its fiscal year 2017 work plan and subsequent monthly updates, the OIG specifically stated that it will review compliance with various aspects of the SNF PPS, including the documentation requirement in support of claims paid by Medicare, and assess the incidence of serious quality of care issues, such as abuse and neglect. In recent years, the OIG and the GAO have also repeatedly called for increased oversight and payment system reform for SNFs.    
In August 2017, the OIG issued an early alert regarding preliminary results of its ongoing review of potential abuse or neglect of Medicare beneficiaries in SNFs. As a result of the review, which is part of the ongoing efforts of the OIG to detect and combat elder abuse, the OIG concluded that CMS has inadequate procedures to ensure that incidents of potential abuse or neglect of beneficiaries residing in SNFs are identified and reported. The OIG provided suggestions for immediate actions that 
9

CMS can take to ensure better protection of beneficiaries. It is unclear what policy changes or oversight efforts CMS will undertake as a result of this early alert.
In addition to scrutiny from the GAO and the OIG, the Senate Special Committee on Aging and other congressional committees have also held hearings on related SNF issues. As a result, CMS has undertaken several initiatives to increase the effectiveness of Medicare and Medicaid SNF survey and enforcement activities. CMS has been taking steps to identify and focus enforcement efforts on SNFs and chains of SNF operators with findings of substandard care or repeat violations of Medicare and Medicaid standards. CMS has also increased its oversight of state survey agencies and has improved the process by which data is captured from these surveys. As an added measure of improving patient care, the ACA provides for the funding of a state background check system for job applicants to long term care providers who will have direct access to patients. CMS has begun the administration of this program, and, as of January 2018, had awarded funding to approximately half of the states.
In addition, CMS adopted regulations expanding federal and state authority to impose civil monetary penalties in instances of noncompliance. When CMS or state agencies identify deficiencies under state licensing and Medicare and Medicaid standards, they may impose sanctions and remedies such as denials of payment for new Medicare and Medicaid admissions, civil monetary penalties, state oversight, temporary management or receivership and loss of Medicare and Medicaid participation or licensure on SNF operators. Our communities may incur sanctions and penalties from time to time. If we are unable to cure deficiencies that have been identified or that are identified in the future, or if appeals of proposed sanctions or penalties are not successful, decertification or additional sanctions or penalties may be imposed. These consequences may adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Certificates of Need. As a mechanism to prevent overbuilding and subsequent healthcare price inflation, many states limit the number of SNFs by requiring developers to obtain CONs before new facilities may be built or additional beds may be added to existing facilities. As noted above, a few states also limit the number of assisted living facilities by requiring CONs. In addition, some states (such as California and Texas) that have eliminated CON laws have retained other means of limiting new development, including moratoria, licensing laws or limitations upon participation in the state Medicaid program. These government requirements limit expansion, which we believe may make existing SNFs more valuable by limiting competition.
Healthcare Reform. The ACA was intended to expand access to health insurance coverage, including Medicaid coverage, and reduce the growth of healthcare expenditures while simultaneously maintaining or improving the quality of healthcare. 
The ACA also encouraged the development and testing of bundled payment for services models, the development of Medicare value-based purchasing plans as well as several initiatives to encourage states to develop and expand home and community based services under Medicaid. Some of the provisions of the ACA took effect immediately, whereas others took effect or will take effect at later dates.
The ACA has been subject to judicial, legislative, and executive review over the past several years. In particular, the U.S. Supreme Court issued several decisions related to the scope of the ACA, including upholding the Medicaid expansion provision. In 2017, Congress accelerated its attempts to repeal and replace the ACA and in 2018 the Trump Administration has continued to modify the ACA through the regulatory process.
In June 2017, HHS solicited suggestions for changes that could be made within the existing ACA legal framework to improve health insurance markets and meet the Trump Administration’s reform goals. HHS sought comments from interested parties to inform its ongoing efforts to create a more patient-centered healthcare system that adheres to the key principles of affordability, accessibility, quality, innovation and empowerment.
On October 12, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order that modified certain aspects of the ACA. Specifically, the executive order directed federal agencies to reduce limits on association health plans and temporary insurance plans, allowing more widespread offerings of plans that do not adhere to all of the ACA’s mandates, and to permit workers to use funds from tax advantaged accounts to pay for their own coverage. On October 2, 2018, the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, and CMS issued regulations to permit insurers to sell short-term plans that provide coverage for up to 12 months; previous Obama Administration guidance had limited such plans to 90 days. Short term plans are often less expensive than plans that meet the requirements of the ACA; however, short-term plans are also exempt from the ACA’s essential health benefits and other consumer protection requirements. In addition, on October 22, 2018, CMS announced that future Section 1332 of the ACA state health insurance innovation waivers may include short term or association health plans as having coverage comparable to ACA plans.    
10

In 2018, the ACA was also subject to lawsuits that sought to invalidate some or all of its provisions. In Texas, a lawsuit brought by 18 attorneys general and two governors in federal district court argued that, following the legislative repeal of the ACA mandate’s tax penalties (by setting the penalty to $0), the entire ACA should be enjoined as invalid. On December 14, 2018, the court found that the ACA, following the mandate repeal, was unconstitutional. Following the ruling, additional state attorneys general intervened as defendants in the case and, on December 30, 2018, the court granted the intervenor defendants’ request for a stay pending appeal.
We cannot estimate the type or magnitude of the potential Medicare and Medicaid policy changes, rate reductions or other changes and the impact on us of the possible failure of these programs to increase rates to match our increasing expenses, but they may be material to and adversely affect our future results of operations. Similarly, we are unable to predict the impact on us of the insurance reforms, payment reforms, and healthcare delivery systems reforms contained in and to be developed pursuant to the ACA. Expanded or decreased insurance availability may impact the number of paying customers for the services we provide. If the changes implemented under the ACA result in reduced payments for our services or the failure of Medicare, Medicaid or insurance payment rates to cover our costs, our future financial results could be adversely and materially affected. If the ACA is repealed, replaced or modified, additional risks and regulatory uncertainty may arise. Depending upon what aspects of the ACA are repealed, replaced or modified, our future financial results could be adversely and materially affected.
Regulatory Reform. In the fall of 2018, the Trump Administration, including HHS, updated its “Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions,” which lists the scope and anticipated timing of pending and future regulations. In releasing the agenda, the Administration highlighted its “ongoing progress toward the goals of more effective and less burdensome regulation,” which appears to be consistent with Executive Order 13771’s mandate to eliminate two economically significant regulations for every one added. It is unclear how these regulatory reform efforts will impact our operations. Some of the regulatory updates described above may in the future be repealed, replaced or modified as a result of these regulatory reform efforts. For instance, in the latest update, HHS and CMS stated their intent to propose changes to the current Conditions of Participation or Conditions for Coverage that healthcare organizations must meet in order to begin and continue participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This may include additional changes to the Conditions of Participation for long term care facilities that participate in Medicare and Medicaid, such as our SNFs. We are unable to predict the impact on us of these or other regulatory reform efforts. While these efforts could ultimately decrease regulatory burden for our operations in the long term, they may increase regulatory uncertainty in the near term.
We are unable to predict the impact on us of these or other regulatory reform efforts. While these efforts could ultimately decrease regulatory burden for our operations in the long term, they may increase regulatory uncertainty in the near term. 

Tax Reform. On December 22, 2017, legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, became effective, enacting significant change to the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the IRC. The TCJA significantly impacts major aspects of the national economy, including the healthcare industry.
Enforcement. Federal and state efforts to target false claims, fraud and abuse and violations of anti‑kickback, physician referral (including the Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989), privacy and consumer protection laws by providers under Medicare, Medicaid and other public and private programs have increased in recent years, as have civil monetary penalties, treble damages, repayment requirements and criminal sanctions for noncompliance. The FCA, as amended and expanded by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, and the ACA, provides significant civil monetary penalties and treble damages for false claims and authorizes individuals to bring claims on behalf of the federal government for false claims. The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law authorizes the Secretary of HHS to impose substantial civil penalties, treble damages and program exclusions administratively for false claims or violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. In addition, the ACA increased penalties under federal sentencing guidelines by between 20% and 50% for healthcare fraud offenses involving more than $1.0 million. State Attorneys General typically enforce consumer protection laws relating to senior living services, clinics and other healthcare facilities.
Government authorities are devoting increasing attention and resources to the prevention, detection and prosecution of healthcare fraud and abuse. The OIG has guidelines for SNFs intended to assist them in developing voluntary compliance programs to prevent fraud and abuse; these guidelines recommend that CMS identify SNFs that are billing for higher paying RUGs and more closely monitor their compliance with patient therapy assessments as methods of fraud prevention. CMS contractors are also expanding the retroactive audits of Medicare claims submitted by SNFs and other providers, and recouping alleged overpayments for services determined by auditors not to have been medically necessary or not to meet Medicare coverage criteria as billed. State Medicaid programs and other third party payers are conducting similar medical necessity and compliance audits. 
11

The ACA facilitates the Department of Justice’s, or the DOJ’s, ability to investigate allegations of wrongdoing or fraud at SNFs, in part because of increased cooperation and data sharing among CMS, the OIG, the DOJ and the states. In 2018, the DOJ announced three settlements with SNF facilities and their affiliates for $6 million, $10 million and $30 million, respectively, relating to allegedly unnecessary rehabilitation therapy services provided to SNF patients. The significant nature of the settlements indicates that the federal government is increasingly focused on the appropriateness of billing practices of, and medical necessity of services provided at, SNFs. The DOJ has also established 10 regional intergovernmental Elder Justice Task Forces across the country to identify and take enforcement action against SNFs that provide substandard care to residents.
In addition, the ACA requires all states to terminate the Medicaid participation of any provider that has been terminated under Medicare or any other state Medicaid plan. Moreover, state Medicaid fraud control agencies may investigate and prosecute assisted living communities and SNFs, clinics and other healthcare facilities under fraud and patient abuse and neglect laws. We expect that increased enforcement and monitoring by government agencies will cause us to expend considerable amounts on regulatory compliance and likely reduce the profits available from providing healthcare services. 
Current state laws and regulations allow enforcement officials to make determinations as to whether the care provided at our communities exceeds the level of care for which a particular community is licensed. A finding that a community is delivering care beyond the scope of its license could result in closure of the community and the immediate discharge and transfer of residents. Some states and the federal government allow certain citations of one community to impact other communities operated by the same entity or a related entity, including communities in other states. Revocation of a license or certification at one of our communities could therefore impact our ability to obtain new licenses or certifications or to maintain or renew existing licenses and certifications at other communities, and trigger defaults under our leases, our management agreements with SNH and our credit facility or adversely affect our ability to operate or obtain financing in the future. In addition, an adverse finding by state officials could serve as the basis for lawsuits by private plaintiffs and lead to investigations under federal and state laws, which could result in civil and/or criminal penalties against the community as well as a related entity.
Other Matters. Our communities must comply with laws designed to protect the confidentiality and security of individually identifiable information. Under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, our communities must comply with rules adopted by HHS governing the privacy, security, use and disclosure of individually identifiable information, including financial information and protected health information, or PHI, and also with security rules for electronic PHI. There may be both civil monetary penalties and criminal sanctions for noncompliance with these laws. Under the HITECH Act, penalties for violation of certain provisions may be as high as $50,000 per violation for a maximum civil penalty of $1.5 million per calendar year. In January 2013, HHS released the HIPAA Omnibus Rule, or the Omnibus Rule, which went into effect in March 2013 and required compliance with most provisions by September 2013. The Omnibus Rule modified various requirements, including the standard for providing breach notices, previously required an analysis of the harm of any disclosure, to a more objective analysis relating to whether any PHI was actually acquired or viewed as a result of the breach. In addition to HIPAA, many states have enacted their own security and privacy laws relating to individually identifiable information, including financial information and PHI. In some states, these laws are more burdensome than HIPAA. In instances in which the state provisions are more stringent than or differ from HIPAA, our communities must comply with both the applicable federal and state standards. If we fail to comply with applicable federal or state standards, we could be subject to civil sanctions and criminal penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. HIPAA enforcement efforts have increased considerably over the past few years, with HHS, through its Office for Civil Rights, entering into several multi-million dollar HIPAA settlements in 2018 alone. Finally, the Office for Civil Rights and other regulatory bodies have become increasingly focused on cybersecurity risks, including the emerging threat of ransomware and similar cyber attacks. The increasing sophistication of cybersecurity threats presents challenges to the entire healthcare industry.
Our communities must also comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA, and similar state and local laws to the extent that such communities are “public accommodations” as defined in those laws. The obligation to comply with the ADA and other similar laws is an ongoing obligation, and we continue to assess our communities and make appropriate modifications. 
INSURANCE
Litigation against senior living and healthcare companies continues to increase, and liability insurance costs continue to increase as a result. In addition, our employee benefit costs, including health insurance and workers’ compensation insurance, continue to increase. To partially offset these insurance cost increases, we have taken a number of actions, including:
12


• | becoming fully self insured for all health related claims of covered employees;


• | increasing the deductible or retention amounts for which we are liable under our liability insurance;


• | operating an offshore captive insurance company which participates in our workers’ compensation, professional and general liability and certain of our automobile liability insurance programs, which may allow us to reduce our net insurance costs by retaining the earnings on our reserves, provided our claims experience does not exceed that projected by various statutory and actuarial formulas;


• | increasing the amounts that some of our employees are required to pay for health insurance coverage and copayments for health services and pharmaceutical prescriptions and decreasing the amount of certain healthcare benefits as well as adding a high deductible health insurance plan as an option for our employees;


• | utilizing insurance and other professional advisors to help us establish programs to reduce our workers’ compensation and professional and general liabilities, including a program to monitor and proactively settle liability claims and to reduce workplace injuries;


• | utilizing insurance and other professional advisors to help us establish appropriate reserves for our retained liabilities and captive insurance programs; and


• | participating with ABP Trust and other companies to which RMR LLC provides management services in a combined property insurance program through Affiliates Insurance Company, or AIC, and with respect to which AIC is an insurer or a reinsurer of certain coverage amounts. For more information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Related Person Transactions” and Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.

We partially self insure up to certain limits for workers’ compensation, professional and general liability, automobile and property coverage. Claims in excess of these limits are insured up to contractual limits, over which we are self insured. Our current insurance arrangements are generally renewable annually. We cannot be sure that our insurance charges and self insurance reserve requirements will not increase, and we cannot predict the amount of any such increase, or to what extent, if at all, we may be able to offset any such increase through higher deductibles, retention amounts, self insurance or other means in the future. 
COMPETITION

The senior living services business is highly competitive. We compete with numerous other senior living community operators, as well as companies that provide senior living services, such as home healthcare companies and other real estate based service providers. Some of our existing competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than us and some of our competitors are not for profit entities which have endowment income and may not face the same financial pressures that we do. Also, in recent years a significant number of new senior living communities have been developed, and we expect this increased development activity to continue in the future. This development activity has increased competitive pressures on us, particularly in the geographic markets where we have concentrations of senior living communities. We may enter additional arrangements with SNH for us to operate additional senior living communities that SNH owns, and our relationships with SNH and RMR LLC may provide us with competitive advantages; however, SNH is not obligated to provide us with opportunities to operate additional properties it owns. We cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully or operate profitably, and, as noted elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under the heading “Going Concern” in this Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. For more information on the competitive pressures we face and associated risks, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE CHANGE MATTERS

Ownership of real estate is subject to risks associated with environmental hazards. Under various laws, owners as well as tenants and operators of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up or remove hazardous substances present at or migrating from properties they own, lease or operate and may be held liable for property damage or personal injuries that result from hazardous substances. These laws also expose us to the possibility that we may become liable to government agencies or third parties for costs and damages they incur in connection with hazardous substances. In addition, these laws also impose various requirements regarding the operation and maintenance of properties and recordkeeping and reporting requirements relating to environmental matters that require us to incur costs to comply with.
13

Under our leases with SNH, we have agreed to indemnify SNH for any environmental liabilities it incurs related to our leased senior living communities and the properties on which they are located. We reviewed environmental surveys of certain of our owned and leased properties prior to their purchase or the commencement of our lease of the communities. Based upon those surveys, other studies we may have reviewed and our operations of these senior living communities, we do not believe that there are environmental conditions at any of our owned or leased senior living communities that have had or will have a material adverse effect on us. However, we cannot be sure that environmental conditions are not present at our owned or leased senior living communities, or that potential costs we incur in the future related to any such conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or results of operations.
When major weather or climate-related events, such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires, occur near our senior living communities, we may relocate the residents at our senior living communities to alternative locations for their safety and close or limit the operations of the impacted senior living community until the event has ended and the senior living community is then ready for operation. We may incur significant costs and losses as result of these activities, both in terms of operating, preparing and repairing our senior living communities in anticipation of, during and after a severe weather or climate-related event and in terms of potential lost business due to the interruption in operating our senior living communities. Our insurance may not adequately compensate us for these costs and losses.
Concerns about climate change have resulted in various treaties, laws and regulations that are intended to limit carbon emissions and address other environmental concerns. These and other laws may cause energy or other costs at our communities to increase. In the long term, we believe any such increased costs will be passed through and paid by our residents and other customers in higher charges for our services. However, in the short term, these increased costs, if material in amount, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For more information regarding climate change and other environmental matters and their possible adverse impact on us, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business-Our operations are subject to environmental risks,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business-Our operations are subject to climate change and adverse weather risks” and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Impact of Climate Change".

We are aware of the impact of our communities on the environment. When we renovate our senior living communities, we generally use energy efficient products including lighting, windows and heating ventilation and air conditioning equipment.
GOING CONCERN
We face increased competition across the senior living industry, including in specific markets in which we operate senior living communities. Medical advances and healthcare services also allow some potential residents to defer the time when they require the special services available at our communities. In addition, low unemployment in the United States combined with a competitive labor market within our industry are increasing our employment costs. These challenges are currently negatively impacting our revenues, expenses, cash flows and results from operations, and we expect these challenges to continue at least through 2019. At December 31, 2018, we have an accumulated deficit of $292.6 million and have incurred operating losses in each of the last three years. In addition, our credit facility is scheduled to expire on June 28, 2019, and we currently have $51.5 million of borrowings outstanding under that facility. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
We currently operate 260 senior living communities under lease and management arrangements with SNH, or approximately 91.5% of the total communities we operate. In order to address the operating and liquidity issues we are currently experiencing, our Independent Directors and SNH’s independent trustees are currently evaluating our lease and management arrangements with SNH. As a result, there may be agreed changes to our arrangements with SNH in the future. In addition, we are also currently evaluating options to refinance our existing credit facility, which is scheduled to expire on June 28, 2019. We cannot be sure that any changes to our arrangements with will be agreed to or occur. If we are not able to reach agreement to change our arrangements with SNH, we will likely default on our rent obligations owed to SNH unless we obtain relief. For example, we expect to obtain a temporary deferral from SNH on our obligation to pay rent to SNH under our leases with SNH for the month of February 2019 but we cannot be sure that SNH will grant us this deferral; if we do not receive this deferral or any other relief we may need in the future, we may default in paying some or all of the rent due to SNH. In addition, we cannot be sure that we will obtain any renewed or restructured credit facility, and our ability to do so will likely depend on the lenders’ belief that our prospects, operating leverage and expected future operating results will permit us to continue as a going concern and to fund our operations, capital investments and debt service and other obligations. Any changes to our lease or management arrangements with SNH or renewed or restructured credit facility may not result in our realizing improved operating results or liquidity and may not be sufficient to enable us to continue as a going concern.
