MARKETS
 
United States
 
Over the past 30 years, obesity in the United States has risen dramatically. In 2013, the American Medical Association officially declared obesity a disease and new treatment guidelines were jointly issued from the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the Obesity Society recommending obesity be managed as a chronic disease. The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 1.9 billion people 46 years and older are overweight worldwide, triple the rate since 1975. In the United States, over one-third of the adult population fall within the overweight or obese categories and approximately 37% (over 78 million) are obese.
 
Obesity is defined as a Body Mass Index (“BMI”) of 30 kg/m2 or greater, whereas overweight is defined as a BMI ranging between 25 and 29.9 kg/m2. In 2016, the United States had an obesity rate of at least 20%. Only four states had an obesity rate that was less than 25%; twenty-five states had an adult obesity rate of 30% or higher. Being overweight and/or obese is linked to a multitude of serious comorbidities including heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, certain types of cancers, arthritis, sleep apnea and depression. In fact, the 2016 State of Obesity Report by Trust for America’s Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimated 80% of people with diabetes are overweight or obese.
 
The primary factors contributing to obesity, are well known: unhealthy food choices, excessive caloric intake, and lack of physical activity. Obesity is not limited to adults, children and adolescents are also affected. According to the Center for Disease Control (the “CDC”), in the past 30 years the prevalence of obesity in children age 6-11 years has doubled and obesity rates have quadrupled in adolescents age 12-19 years. Approximately 18% of children and 21% of adolescents are obese and are at an increased risk of developing health problems such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and prediabetes.
 
The United States spends an estimated $190 billion on obesity-related medical conditions; the average annual medical costs for those who are obese are over $1,400 higher than those of people in a normal weight range. The United States weight loss market itself is estimated to be a $65 billion per year industry, including consumer spending on diet foods, drinks and low-calorie sweeteners; health clubs and workout videos; medically supervised and commercial weight loss programs; children’s weight loss camps; diet books; appetite suppressants and more. Portion-controlled, meal-replacement weight management programs are continuing to gain popularity, as consumers search for a safe and effective solution that provides balanced nutrition, effective weight loss, and valuable behavior-modification education.
 
Asia
 
On February 28, 2018, we announced that we will be introducing our Coach model and products through the OPTAVIA brand in Hong Kong and Singapore. This part of Asia has seen a dynamic shift in how health care is being prioritized and consumed.
 
As middle class consumers in these markets gain higher disposable incomes, health has increasingly become a priority in their lifestyles. Traditional remedies are still essential, however consumers are incorporating the consumption of healthy living products into their daily lives and healthy foods and eating habits are gaining popularity.
 
We cannot make any assurances regarding the acceptance of our healthy living products by consumers in these new markets.
 
OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS UNITS
 
THE MEDIFAST® BRAND 
 
Medifast enriches lives by providing weight loss, weight management, and healthy living products and other consumable health and nutritional products through multiple channels of distribution, specifically: (1) OPTAVIA, our direct to consumer business unit through word-of-mouth communication and personal one-on-one coaching; (2) Medifast Direct, our direct to consumer business unit through our website and in-house call centers; (3) Franchise Medifast Weight Control Centers, our bricks and mortar-based customer support centers offering a fee-based consultation service and Medifast-branded products; and (4) Medifast Wholesale, a national network of physicians. Medifast products and programs have been recommended by over 20,000 doctors since its founding.
PRODUCTS
 
Our products were originally developed by a physician and Medifast has been on the cutting edge in the development of nutritional and weight-management products since the Company was founded. The Company offers a variety of weight loss, weight management, and healthy living products under the Medifast®, OPTAVIA, Thrive by Medifast, Optimal Health by OPTAVIA, Flavors of Home®, and Essential 1 brands. The Medifast meal replacement line includes more than 65 options, including, but not limited to, bars, bites, pretzels, puffs, cereal crunch, drinks, hearty choices, oatmeal, pancakes, pudding, soft serve, shakes, smoothies, soft bakes, and soups. The Thrive by Medifast and Optimal Health by OPTAVIA lines include a variety of specially formulated bars, shakes, and smoothies for those who are maintaining their weight for long-term healthy living. Medifast identifies opportunities to expand its product line by regularly surveying its customer base and studying industry and consumer trends. This allows Medifast to introduce new, high quality products that meet consumer demand.

Medifast nutritional products are formulated with high-quality, low-calorie, and low-fat ingredients. Products include individually portioned, calorie- and carbohydrate-controlled meal replacements that share a similar nutritional “footprint” and provide a balance of protein and good carbohydrates. The Company’s meal replacements are also fortified to contain vitamins and minerals, as well as other nutrients essential for good health.
 
Medifast programs and products have been proven to be effective for weight loss and weight management in clinical studies conducted by researchers from leading universities. We manufacture all powder-based products at our manufacturing facility located in Owings Mills, Maryland and subcontract the production of all other products.
 
DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS UNITS
 
OPTAVIA – OPTAVIA is the personal coaching unit of Medifast. This coach community is made up of OPTAVIA Coaches, who are independent contractors and trained to provide coaching and support to clients utilizing the OPTAVIA platform. The role of the OPTAVIA Coach is to provide support and personal encouragement to help clients effectively reach and sustain a healthy weight, and adopt healthy habits for a lifetime of health. Through our Optimal Health offer, the Company offers individuals an opportunity to create sustainable health in all areas of their lives – physical, emotional, and financial health. In addition to the encouragement and support provided by our OPTAVIA Coaches, OPTAVIA clients are offered online product and program information, tools and support, and access to our registered dieticians. OPTAVIA clients order our products through either the Company’s website, their OPTAVIA Coach’s personal website or our in-house call center. In addition to the full line of Medifast branded products and programs, the Company also offers an exclusive product line under the lifestyle brand OPTAVIA. Our OPTAVIA Coaches provide coaching and support to their clients throughout the weight-loss and weight-maintenance process. Most new OPTAVIA Coaches are introduced to the opportunity by an existing OPTAVIA Coach. The vast majority of new OPTAVIA Coaches started as weight-loss clients, who had success on the OPTAVIA program, and became an OPTAVIA Coach in order to help others through the weight-loss process.
 
OPTAVIA is a member of the Direct Selling Association (the “DSA”), a national trade association representing over 200 direct selling companies doing business in the United States. To become a member of the DSA, OPTAVIA, like other active DSA member companies, underwent a comprehensive and rigorous one-year company review by DSA that included a detailed analysis of its company business-plan materials. This review is designed to ensure that a company’s business practices do not contravene DSA’s Code of Ethics. In addition to its DSA membership, OPTAVIA is also a voluntary DSA Code of Ethics participant, which sets higher standards for ensuring compliance. Compliance with the requirements of the Code of Ethics is paramount to becoming and remaining a member in good standing of the DSA. Accordingly, we believe membership in the DSA by OPTAVIA demonstrates its commitment to the highest standards of ethics and a pledge not to engage in any deceptive, unlawful, or unethical business practices, such as pyramid and other similar schemes. Moreover, OPTAVIA, like other DSA member companies in good standing, has pledged to provide consumers with accurate and truthful information regarding the price, grade, quality, and performance of the products OPTAVIA markets. In 2017, OPTAVIA, and its parent company Medifast were ranked in the DSA’s Top 20 list, a recognition given annually to the largest direct selling companies in the United States.
 
The majority of the Company’s revenue is generated by our Coach model and OPTAVIA branded products and the future growth of the Company primarily depends on the growth of the OPTAVIA Coaches worldwide. Internally, we have restructured our personnel to eliminate any business segment distinction and have begun to shift clients from our previous Medifast Direct business unit to the Coach model to experience the support of an OPTAVIA coach throughout their health journey. As a result, in the first quarter of 2018, the Company will no longer report separate financial information for the four business units that existed historically.
 
Medifast Direct – Through Medifast Direct, our direct-to-consumer business unit, customers order Medifast products directly through the Company’s website, www.medifastnow.com or our in-house call center. Upon request, customers can also be connected to an OPTAVIA Coach. This business is driven by a multi-media customer acquisition and retention strategy that includes digital advertising, direct mail, email, public relations, word of mouth referrals, social media initiatives, and other means as deemed appropriate. Medifast Direct provides support through its in-house call center and nutrition support team of registered dietitians to better serve its customers. The Company is in the process of transitioning the Medifast Direct business unit to integrate into our Coach model for the benefit of our OPTAVIA Coach community and clients. We believe that this alignment will help to enhance our long-term success and will facilitate the expansion into new markets over time.
 
Franchise Medifast Weight Control Centers – The Franchise Medifast Weight Control Centers (“MWCC”) business unit sells product through franchise and reseller locations. These locations offer structured programs and a team of professionals to help customers achieve weight-loss and weight-management success at center locations. Counselors at each location work with members to provide nutritional and behavioral support based on the member’s personal needs. As of December 31, 2017, MWCC had 16 franchised centers located in Arizona, California, Louisiana, Minnesota and Wisconsin and 18 reseller locations in California, Maryland and Pennsylvania as compared to a total of 37 franchised centers and 19 reseller locations as of December 31, 2016.
 
In 2008, we, through MFSI, our wholly-owned subsidiary, began offering the center model as a franchise opportunity. The franchise offered is for the establishment and operation of center-based retail weight loss centers (“Medifast Weight Control Centers”, or “Medifast Centers”) that sell Medifast-branded meal replacement products and lifestyle education services to overweight and obese individuals. All franchisees must agree to develop a minimum of three (3) Medifast Centers within a defined geographic region and within the time frame set forth in the Franchise Agreement and Development Agreement executed by MFSI and the franchisee. MFSI is required to provide certain ongoing support and assistance to the franchisee. The franchisee must purchase Medifast-branded products from MFSI’s affiliates, must operate the Medifast Centers according to MFSI’s standards, and must pay royalty and other fees to MFSI. Counselors at each location work with members to provide nutritional and behavioral support based on the member’s personal needs. While MFSI does not currently have a purchase option included in its Franchise Agreements and Development Agreements, it does have the right of first refusal to acquire a center if the franchisee wishes to sell a center. MFSI may, in certain limited circumstances, cause its affiliate to provide products to franchisees at a discounted price. Medifast has in the past guaranteed a franchisee’s notes, leases or other obligations. MFSI does not offer direct or indirect financing.

In 2016, Medifast entered into distribution and licensing agreements with 19 weight control centers previously operating as franchise locations. In 2017, one weight control center closed. These businesses now operate as reseller locations. Under the terms of these agreements, the locations have been rebranded and offer products and services in addition to those available at a Medifast Weight Control Center. These additional products complement the Medifast products and plans, which are still utilized as the exclusive weight management program at these locations. These resellers may use Medifast’s trademarks in their marketing and advertising efforts and continue to purchase Medifast-branded products at wholesale directly from the Company.
 
In 2017, we started the process of converting one of our largest franchisees from the MWCC business unit model to our Coach model. This transition will allow existing and future clients to access the exclusive OPTAVIA branded products and coaching experience going forward. MFSI intends to continue to support its remaining franchisees and the franchised Medifast Centers as required under the Franchise Agreements. However, MFSI’s ongoing franchise strategy depends on the franchisees’ active involvement in, management of, and continued operation of, their Medifast Weight Control Center operations.
 
Medifast Wholesale –As of December 2017, Medifast discontinued offering its products through the wholesale channel to medical provider practices and provided a transition plan for wholesalers to participate in our Coaching model where they can now provide coaching services, programs and products through the OPTAVIA brand.
 
DISTRIBUTION LICENSING
 
In 2012, the Company entered into a strategic partnership agreement with Medix, a leader in pharmaceutical obesity products in Mexico. The agreement, which was amended in 2013, granted Medix an exclusive license to distribute Medifast products and programs through physicians and weight control centers in Mexico, Central America and South America under the Medifast brand. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company terminated the licensing agreement with Medix. The termination of the contract allows the Company to refocus on our core businesses. During the second quarter of 2017, Medix closed its center locations.
SEASONALITY
 
Historically, sales of the Company's weight management products and programs have been seasonal. Traditionally, predisposition of consumers not to initiate a weight loss or management program during the holiday season impacts the fourth quarter with fewer sales of weight management products and services. January and February generally show increases in sales, as these months are considered the commencement of the “diet season.” In 2017, this seasonality pattern changed as sales were earned evenly throughout the year.
SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY BOARD
 
Medifast has a Scientific Advisory Board that consists of a multi-disciplinary, international panel that serves as the foundation for scientifically-valid, consumer-centric, high quality innovations for lasting health. Its mission is to help guide Medifast in making informed decisions regarding medical, nutritional, and scientific matters by providing expertise and information on research and emerging trends.
 
The work of this cross-disciplinary group builds on Medifast’s heritage of medically sound approaches to weight loss, and the incorporation of leading-edge clinical research into the Company’s products and programs. The Scientific Advisory Board is chaired by Lawrence Cheskin, M.D., F.A.C.P., Associate Professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Director of the Johns Hopkins Weight Management Center.
 
COMPETITION
 
The weight-loss industry is very competitive and encompasses various weight loss products and programs. These include a wide variety of commercial weight-loss programs, pharmaceutical products, books, self-help diets, dietary supplements, appetite suppressants, and meal replacements, as well as, digital tools and wearable trackers. The weight loss market is served by a diverse array of competitors. Potential customers seeking to manage their weight can turn to other traditional center-based competitors, online diet oriented sites, self-directed dieting and self-administered products such as prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as well as medically supervised programs.
 
Medifast’s identified peers and competitors in the general health and wellness diet industry include NutriSystem Inc., Herbalife Ltd., USANA Health Sciences, and Weight Watchers International, Inc. The Company believes that it competes effectively in the weight-loss industry and differentiates itself from the competition.
 
The Company believes its scientific and clinical heritage and commitment to evaluating its products and programs through clinical research are primary differentiators that allow it to compete in this market. Our products were originally developed by a physician, and Medifast has been on the cutting edge in the development of nutritional and weight-management products since the Company was founded. Medifast meals are individually portioned, calorie- and carbohydrate-controlled meal replacements that share a similar nutritional “footprint” and provide a balance of protein and good carbohydrates, including fiber.
 
Another primary differentiator is the Company’s distribution strategy which provides varying support modalities, and broadens the availability of our products and programs. The Coaching model offers the personal support of an OPTAVIA Coach, who is often a person who has achieved success with OPTAVIA and has turned their success into a business opportunity. Medifast Direct serves customers through the Medifast website and call center with various online support tools and resources, as well as access to program specialists and registered dietitians. MWCCs offer an on-site supervised and structured model for customers who prefer more accountability and personalized counseling as part of their ongoing program. Medifast weight management programs utilize meal replacements as part of a structured meal plan that clinical research has shown to be effective for weight loss.

MARKETING 
 
Medifast continues to build and leverage its core Medifast brand through multiple marketing strategies. Customer acquisition and retention strategies vary by distribution business unit and may include word-of-mouth, digital marketing, public relations, social media, email marketing, events, and other means. These mediums are used to target new customers by stressing Medifast's and OPTAVIA’s simple and effective approach to weight loss and management and long term health. Many of these programs are also utilized to reactivate, encourage and support existing customers, clients, and OPTAVIA Coaches. Medifast and OPTAVIA continue to enhance all company materials and websites.
 
MANUFACTURING 
 
Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, manufactures and produces all Medifast powder-based products, which account for approximately 42% of Medifast’s unit sales, in the manufacturing facility in Owings Mills, Maryland. The Company purchased the plant in July 2002 and has gradually increased production capacity and improved overall efficiencies with additional investments in blending and packaging equipment. The remaining 58% of Medifast products are manufactured by third party vendors in accordance with Medifast proprietary formulas and manufacturing standards. Our Owings Mills manufacturing facility is regulated and inspected by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”) and the Maryland State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. It is certified as a Safe Quality Food Program (“SQF”) Level 2 facility compliant with the Global Food Safety Initiative.
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION 
 
Direct Selling Regulations
 
Direct selling is regulated by various national, state and local government agencies in the United States and foreign markets. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, including "pyramid" schemes, which compensate participants primarily for recruiting additional participants without significant emphasis on product sales to consumers. The laws and regulations governing direct selling may be modified or reinterpreted from time to time, which may cause us to modify our sales compensation and business models. In almost all of our markets, regulations are subject to discretionary interpretation by regulators and judicial authorities. There is often ambiguity and uncertainty with respect to the state of direct selling and anti-pyramiding laws and regulations. In the United States, for example, federal law provides law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), broad latitude in policing unfair or deceptive trade practices, but does not provide a bright-line test for identifying a pyramid scheme. Several states have passed legislation that more clearly distinguishes between illegal pyramid schemes and legitimate multi-level marketing business models. Recent settlements between the FTC and other direct selling companies and guidance from the FTC have addressed inappropriate earnings and lifestyle claims and the importance of focusing on consumers. These developments have created a level of ambiguity as to the proper interpretation of the law and related court decisions. For example, in 2015, the FTC took aggressive actions against a multi-level marketing company, alleging an illegal business model and inappropriate earnings claims. We have taken additional steps to educate our distributors on proper earnings claims. If our distributors make improper claims, or if regulators determine we are making any improper claims, this could lead to an FTC investigation and could harm our business.
 
In 2016, the FTC entered into a settlement with another multi-level marketing company, requiring the company to modify its business model, including basing sales compensation and qualification only on sales to retail and preferred customers and on purchases by a distributor for personal consumption within allowable limits. Although this settlement does not represent judicial precedent or a new FTC rule, the FTC has indicated that the industry should look at this settlement, and the principles underlying its specific measures, for guidance. If the requirements in this settlement lead to new industry standards or new rules, our business could be impacted and we may need to amend our global sales compensation plan. With a majority of our revenue in the United States coming from sales to retail and preferred customers, we believe that we can demonstrate consumer demand for our products, but we continue to monitor developments to assess whether we should make any changes to our business or global sales compensation plan. If we are required to make changes or if the FTC seeks to enforce similar measures in the industry, either through rulemaking or an enforcement action against our company, our business could be harmed.
 
Other Regulations
 
A number of laws and regulations govern our advertising and marketing, services, products, operations and relations with consumers, franchisees, and other service providers and government authorities in the countries in which we operate.
 
The formulation, processing, packaging, labeling, marketing, advertising and selling of the Company's products is subject to regulation by federal, state and local agencies. Products must comply with the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Food Safety Modernization Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, State Consumer Protection laws and several other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable in localities in which the company products are made or are sold.
 
The FDA and USDA and State and local Health departments are the major agencies whose regulatory mission is to assure that products are made using approved ingredients, labeling, manufacturing procedures and testing to ensure that safe quality products are delivered to consumers.
 
Laws and regulations directly applicable to data protection and communications, operations or commerce over the Internet, such as those governing intellectual property, privacy and taxation, continue to evolve. Our operations are subject to these laws and regulations and we continue to monitor their development and our compliance. In addition, we are subject to other laws and regulations in the United States and internationally.
 
The FTC has principal regulatory authority over the Company’s advertising and trade practices, its enforcement powers are aimed at protecting the consumer from being deceived by unfair marketing and trading practices.

During the mid-1990s, the FTC filed complaints against a number of commercial weight management providers alleging violations of federal law in connection with the use of advertisements that featured testimonials claims for program success and program costs. In 2012, Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a consent decree with the FTC regarding certain statements included in the advertising for the Company’s weight-loss programs. The consent decree requires us to comply with certain procedures and disclosures in connection with our advertisements of products and services.
 
PRODUCT LIABILITY AND INSURANCE 
 
The Company, like other producers and distributors of ingested products, faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that, among other things, the use of its products results in injury or death. The Company maintains insurance against product liability claims with respect to the products it manufactures. With respect to the retail and direct marketing distribution of products produced by others, the Company's principal form of insurance consists of arrangements with each of its suppliers of those products to name the Company a covered entity under each of such vendor's product liability insurance policies. The Company does not buy products from suppliers who do not maintain such coverage.
EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company employed 399 employees, of whom 170 were engaged in manufacturing, logistics, and supply chain support, and 229 in marketing, administrative, call center and corporate support functions. None of the employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement with the Company. All employees are employed by Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
Our websites are based on commercially developed software and are hosted at a co-location data center located in Baltimore, Maryland. This data center is SSAE16 and PCI-DSS compliant. This facility provides redundant network connections, uninterruptible power supplies, robust physical security, fire prevention controls, and diesel generated power back up for the equipment on which our websites rely. Our servers and our network are monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
 
We use a variety of security techniques to protect our confidential customer data, including regularly scheduled penetration security tests on our websites. We also use an industry leading network monitoring service for our Intrusion Detection Services solution along with Intrusion Prevention System devices on our network’s perimeter. When our customers place an order or access their account information, we use secure channels to encrypt and transmit information. Our security certificates encrypt all information entered before it is sent to our servers. We have a secondary firewall layer of security between our customer facing websites and the databases which house their information and we have deployed mitigation devices to protect against Distributed Denial of Service attacks. Customer data is protected against unauthorized access. We have a redundant network across our organization which provides for inter-connectivity and redundancy for our corporate locations.
 
As our operations grow in both size and scope, we will continuously improve and upgrade our information systems and infrastructure while maintaining their reliability and integrity.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
Products manufactured by and programs marketed by the Company are sold primarily under its own trademarks and trade names. Ours policy is to protect our products and programs through trademark registrations both in the United States and in significant international markets. The Company carefully monitors trademark use and strongly promotes enforcement and protection of all of its trademarks.
