On February 13, 2018, Go2Green Landscaping, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Registrant") executed an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with nDivision Inc, and NDI Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant ("Acquisition") whereby Acquisition was merged with and into nDivision (the "Merger") in consideration for Twenty Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand (27,500,000) newly-issued shares of Common Stock of the Company (the "Merger Shares"). 
 
As a result of the Merger, nDivision became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant and following the consummation of the Merger and giving effect to the issuance of the Merger Shares and the retirement of 10,000,000 shares of the then 14,400,000 shares issued and outstanding of the Registrant by its principal stockholders, the stockholders of nDivision beneficially owned approximately Seventy percent (70%) of the issued and outstanding Common Stock of the Registrant.
 
For accounting purposes, nDivision was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the transaction and, consequently, the transaction was treated as a recapitalization of the Company. Accordingly, nDivision's assets, liabilities and results of operations are the historical consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Company's assets, liabilities and results of operations are consolidated with nDivision effective as of the date of the Merger. No step-up in basis or intangible assets or goodwill was recorded in this transaction.
 
On February 26, 2018, the Company executed an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with Gamwell Technologies Inc., a Texas corporation ("Gamwell").  Gamwell is engaged in the business of providing managed services, VOIP telephone, security consulting and professional services to its customers.
 
As a result of the Agreement, nDivision acquired various managed services contracts (the "Purchased Contracts") from Gamwell. As consideration for the Purchased Contracts, nDivision paid $800,000 (the "Cash Consideration") to Gamwell.  In addition, Gamwell received a promissory note (the "Promissory Note") in an amount that equals fourteen (14) multiplied by the closing monthly recurring revenue from managed services.  The Promissory Note is currently estimated at approximately $191,177 based on the closing monthly recurring revenue.  Gamwell also received warrants (the "Warrants") to purchase common stock of the Company equal to one fourth percent (0.25%) of the outstanding stock of the Company as of the agreement date.  The Warrants were valued at approximately $21,158 at the time of purchase, however these warrants have not been issued as the final purchase price adjustment calculation has not been completed at the time of this report.  The consideration for the contracts purchased was approximately $1,012,335.  The Cash Consideration, Promissory Note and Warrants shall be defined as the "Purchase Price" and can be adjusted after one year, based on the newly calculated monthly recurring revenue. To date, the Company has not made any adjustment to the “Purchase Price” as there has been no newly calculated monthly recurring revenue at the time of this report.
 
Since February 13, 2018, the Company has sold approximately 8,590,847 shares of the Registrant's common shares at a price of approximately $0.375 per share for approximately $3,215,738.  There were no material fees paid in association with these shares being sold.
 
On April 9, 2018, the parent company Go2Green Landscaping, Inc. changed its name to nDivision Inc. and changed the ticker symbol to NDVN.

Our Current Business
 
nDivision supports organizations in their journey towards digital transformation using advanced technologies across the datacenter, cloud, network and end user help desk. Progressive Chief Information Officers (“CIOs”) want to reduce the proportion of their IT budget that is spent on KTLO (Keeping The Lights On) and pivot towards initiatives that make the organization more effective and more efficient; however, IT Operations is still a critical business function and cannot be compromised. In the past, service providers have promised lower costs and improved service levels through labor arbitrage, achieved by utilizing offshore resources. Unfortunately, this has rarely lived up to expectations, and has generally resulted in poor service levels and constant additional costs for ‘out of scope’ work. nDivision takes a radically different approach. It hires some of the best talent in the industry, harnesses technologies like automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning and cognitive to dramatically reduce costs and drive up service levels. nDivision’s business model is driven by state-of-the-art technologies, low overheads through strategies that include remote working, a flat organizational structure and highly motivated & talented U.S. based employees. The net effect is a very competitive value proposition and delighted customers. nDivision’s services are industry segment agnostic and its customers range from a small and midsize business (“SMB”), through midmarket and large enterprise (the largest customer is a Fortune 500 account). It provides remote support for customer IT operations in 45 countries and across six continents. One of the top ten global solution providers ($60bn+ revenues) resells nDivision’s services across the U.S., and a second ($110bn+ revenues) has begun recommending nDivision’s services in its South-Central U.S. region.
Services and Solutions
 
Autonomic Services
 
VIRTUAL ENGINEER AS A SERVICE (VEaaS®)
 IT has become increasingly pervasive, and its ‘always on’ requirement has made it highly critical. In order to keep it up and running, organizations grew larger and larger IT departments and invested in more and more tools. The problem with this approach is that it is dependent on humans carrying out tasks and using tools, and humans are relatively slow, make mistakes and are transient. VEaaS® meets these challenges head on by typically automating between 60% and 80% of IT Operations tasks across the datacenter and network, after the first twelve months of the service.
SINGLE PANE-OF-GLASS IT OPERATIONS
 VEaaS® is an integrated IT Operations platform, not a collection of tools. It is made up of 28 different modules, all of which were developed from the ground up (i.e. no acquired IP) and are fully ITIL compliant. Organizations can choose to implement some or all of the modules, for the same all-inclusive price. Every function is available through a single pane-of-glass, providing visibility and control of incidents, remediation, assets, change management, problem management, knowledge management, SOP’s, etc.
INTEGRATED CMDB
 An accurate Configuration Management Database (CMDB) is the heart of ITSM (IT Service Management). Very few major organizations have an accurate CMDB, and many of those who are trying to get there are using a spreadsheet. VEaaS® has an integrated CMDB that is controlled by the change management module, making it very difficult to add, remove or change Configuration Items without maintaining the integrity of the CMDB. Further, the CMDB within VEaaS® can store correlations and dependencies, which improves incident management, and is invaluable when planning major changes such as datacenter and/or cloud migrations.

PRE-BUILT AUTOMATIONS
 There are a number of tools available that allow automations to be scripted, however, VEaaS® includes over 20,000 unique pre-built automations spanning multiple areas such as infrastructure, operating systems, hypervisors, services, databases and major applications. These automations run across solutions from all the major vendors and can either run as standard or using a WYSIWYG ‘drag and drop’ approach, can be quickly customized to match an organization’s SOP’s. In fact, if an asset is IP-addressable, can accept keyboard-based commands and generate outputs, it can be part of an automation.
AUTONOMIC MANAGED SERVICE (AMS)
 nDivision's AMS is built on the VEaaS® platform. In many cases, VEaaS® resolves incidents without any human involvement; this is referred to as Autonomic Resolution. In other cases, VEaaS® gathers all the relevant information at the time that an incident occurs and automatically escalates the ticket to a human engineer; this is referred to as Autonomic Assistance. Sometimes, the VEaaS® platform will notify a human engineer that it has resolved a particular incident multiple times in a given time period and will automatically escalate the incident to Problem Management. There are also some situations where an incident cannot be addressed autonomically and a human will have to investigate the incident and carry out remediation. Where an organization does not want to use its human labor for tasks that cannot be carried out autonomically, nDivision's AMS provides an ITIL Level 1 Autonomic Managed Service (L1 AMS) and an ITIL Level 2 Autonomic Managed Service (L2 AMS).
END USER HELP DESK
 nDivision understands that every minute that an end user is unable to access an IT service or technology costs the organization money. If that user is a knowledge-worker, C-level executive or other key resource, the costs can be significantly higher. Furthermore, equipment costs may only represent 20% of the Total Cost of Ownership, with support costs representing the other 80%. Therefore, optimizing access to technology is a critical area of cost-saving and improved productivity.
 
Many organizations find that providing a multi-tiered Help Desk for its end users can be challenging. Often, Tier 2 resources cannot be spared to address complex end user issues, which leads to protracted user response and resolution times. Also, when resources are limited, providing a high level of support outside of business hours and over weekends can be difficult to do effectively.
 
Our Proactive service provides a single point of contact for ticketing and remediation through email, web or by phone, and is charged for based on the number of devices. We install an agent on each device that allows us to quickly provide remote control support and keep patches up to date. The service includes anti-virus & anti-malware protection (or we can leverage your solution) and software distribution for operating systems and applications. Bare metal backups and recovery is an optional service. We leverage manufacturer warranties or a spares program, as needed. All support staff for our Proactive service are based in the U.S.
 
Our real-time Executive Dashboard provides data on the quality of service (each interaction can be rated by the user), call center statistics (abandonment, talk time, hold time, etc.), inventory data (asset type, operating system, location, etc.) and patching data (installed, missing approved and failed). The Speed of Service metrics includes service level achievement, speed by priority, speed by time and speed by support team member. The Resolved Tickets metrics includes count by team, percentage closed by team, mean time to respond and mean time to resolve. Custom views can also be created as a separate services engagement.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We market and sell our services directly through our professional staff, senior management and direct sales personnel operating out of our business development offices and from home-based locations. We also partner with a number of global service providers (GSPs) that either resell our services across the U.S. or recommend our services to their targeted customers.

Customers
 
The services we provide are distributed among a number of customers, however a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a short period of time could have a significant impact on our business and could materially reduce revenues. However, the services we provide directly to our customers are multi-year contracts with automatic renewals for at least a year, unless at least ninety (90) days’ notice is served to end the contract at the end of the current term. This provides time for us to adjust our resources accordingly and minimize the impact to cash flow. However, the services that we provide to our larger customers are typically critical to their operations and a termination of our services and therefore have a high renewal rate. The volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from month to month, but these are typically not material variances.
Competition
 
The markets for our services are highly competitive, characterized by a large number of participants and subject to rapid change. Competitors may include systems integration firms, contract programming companies, application software companies, cloud computing service providers, traditional consulting firms, professional services groups of computer equipment companies, infrastructure management and outsourcing companies and boutique digital companies. Our direct competitors in large accounts include, among others, Accenture, Atos, Capgemini, Deloitte Digital, DXC Technology, Unisys, HCL Technologies, IBM Global Services, Infosys Technologies, NTT Data, Tata Consultancy Services, Unisys and Wipro. In addition, we compete with numerous smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which we operate.
 
The principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our services include the provider’s reputation and experience, vision and strategic advisory ability, digital services capabilities, performance and reliability, responsiveness to customer needs, financial stability, corporate governance and competitive pricing of services. Accordingly, we rely on the following to compete effectively:
 ·         investments in state-of-the-art technologies; 
 ·         our recruiting, training and retention model;
 ·         our 24/7 remote global service delivery model; 
 ·         an entrepreneurial culture and approach to our work;
 ·         strategic partnerships with global service providers;
 ·         customer referrals;
 ·         investment in process improvement and knowledge capture;
 ·         financial stability and good corporate governance;
 ·         continued focus on responsiveness to customer needs, quality of services and competitive prices; and
 ·         continual service improvement, project management capabilities and technical expertise.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We provide value to our customers based, in part, on our proprietary business processes, methodologies, reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property ("IP") assets. We recognize the importance of IP and its ability to differentiate us from our competitors. We seek IP protection for some of our innovations and rely on a combination of IP laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our IP and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights. While our proprietary IP rights are important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular IP right, or any particular group of patents, trademarks, copyrights or licenses.
