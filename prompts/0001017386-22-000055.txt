ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business
 
Pedro’s List, Inc., formerly known as Quest Management, Inc. the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 12, 2014. The Company originally intended to engage in the business of development of marketing channels to distribute fitness equipment to the wholesale market in the United States. The Company is currently looking for acquisition candidates that would bring operations, profitability and cash flows to the Company. From October 12, 2014- July 31,2018, Quest Management was in the early stages of developing our business, which is to develop marketing channels to distribute third-party fitness equipment to wholesale markets in the US. Fitness equipment would be any apparatus or device used during physical activity to enhance the strength or conditioning effects of that exercise by providing either fixed or adjustable amounts of resistance or to otherwise enhance the experience or outcome of an exercise routine. As of the year ended October 31, 2021, the Company has had no revenues or business operations.

We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a legal action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.
