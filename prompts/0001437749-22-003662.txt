Item 1. BUSINESS. 
General
 
Art’s-Way Manufacturing Co., Inc., a Delaware corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company”), began operations as a farm equipment manufacturer in 1956. Since that time, we have become a worldwide manufacturer of agricultural equipment, specialized modular science buildings and steel cutting tools. Our principal manufacturing plant is located in Armstrong, Iowa.
 
We have organized our business into three operating segments. Management separately evaluates the financial results of each segment because each is a strategic business unit offering different products and requiring different technology and marketing strategies. Our Agricultural Products segment manufactures and distributes farm equipment under the Art’s-Way name. Our Modular Buildings segment manufactures modular buildings for various uses, commonly animal containment and research laboratories, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Art’s-Way Scientific, Inc., an Iowa corporation. Our Tools segment manufactures standard single point brazed carbide tipped tools as well as PCD (polycrystalline diamond) and CBN (cubic boron nitride) inserts and OEM tools through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Ohio Metal Working Products/Art’s-Way, Inc., an Ohio corporation. For detailed financial information relating to segment reporting, see Note 16 “Segment Information” to our financial statements in “Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” of this report.

Business of Our Segments 
 
Agricultural Products 
 
Our Agricultural Products segment, which accounted for 67.4% of our net revenue in the 2021 fiscal year and 58.4% of our net revenue in the 2020 fiscal year, is located primarily in Armstrong, Iowa. This segment manufactures a variety of specialized farm machinery under our own label, including portable and stationary animal feed processing equipment and related attachments used to mill and mix feed grains into custom animal feed rations; a line of forage equipment consisting of forage boxes, bale processors, running gear, and dump boxes; a line of manure spreaders; sugar beet harvesting equipment; and a line of dirt work equipment. We sell our labeled products through independent farm equipment dealers throughout the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom. We also provide after-market service parts that are available to keep our branded equipment operating to the satisfaction of the end user of our products.
Modular Buildings
 
Our Modular Buildings segment, which accounted for 22.7% of our net revenue in the 2021 fiscal year and 31.2% of our net revenue in the 2020 fiscal year, is located in Monona, Iowa. This segment produces, sells and leases modular buildings, which are custom-designed to meet the specific research needs of our customers. The buildings we commonly produce range from basic swine buildings to complex containment research laboratories. We plan to continue our focus on providing research facilities for academic research institutions, government research and diagnostic centers, public health institutions and private research and pharmaceutical companies, as those are our primary market sectors. We provide services from start to finish by designing, manufacturing, delivering and installing these facilities to meet customers’ critical requirements. In addition to selling these facilities, we also offer a lease option to customers in need of temporary facilities.
Tools
 
Our Tools segment, which is located in Canton, Ohio, accounted for 9.9% of our net revenue in the 2021 fiscal year and 10.4% of our net revenue in the 2020 fiscal year. This segment produces and sells standard single point brazed carbide tipped tools as well as PCD (polycrystalline diamond) and CBN (cubic boron nitride) inserts and tools and OEM specialty tools. The tools are used by manufacturers in various industries to cut and shape various parts, pipes, and fittings. The marketing of the tools is primarily through independent distributors supplying manufacturers with industrial tools and supplies. We plan to continue our focus on providing cutting tools to industries such as automotive, aerospace, oil and gas piping, and appliances.

Our Principal Agricultural Products 
 
Arthur Luscombe built the first PTO powered grinder mixer on his farm near Dolliver, Iowa. The product’s ability to tackle even the most demanding workload made it an overwhelming success – and secured Luscombe’s reputation as a farmer, entrepreneur and independent thinker who did things his way. Over the years our Agricultural Products segment has grown through developing several new products and with acquisitions. We take pride in our manure spreaders, forage equipment, bale processors, dirt work equipment, sugar beet harvesting equipment and feed mills. OEM work is also supplied to the industry’s leading manufacturers.
 
Feed mills. There’s no one better than Art’s Way when it comes to processing feed. Stationary mills for livestock feeding or breweries, portable units for small operations and large grinder mixers for the modern feeding operation have our customers’ backs day in and day out. Hammer mills provide faster processing and easily changing micron size or roller mills offer more consistency. We offer the most complete lineup of equipment in feed processing.
 
Manure spreaders. The X Series spreaders have a unique vertical beater placement combined with guillotine slop gate controls to create the best spread pattern in the industry. Flared sides and densilite flooring provide easy loading and material movement. Backed by our limited lifetime warranty on the apron chain, customers can depend on this rugged machine. The upgraded rate control option powered by Raven is the only unit in the industry to have completely automatic spreading capabilities with apron speed and slop gate control.
 
Forage. The 2100 series are user-friendly forage boxes in different lengths and unload configurations. It is the only box in its class to offer 100% in-cab controls. Tube side stakes and corrugated sides give users confidence when side-by-side with competitor models. The 9016-HD High Dump cart boasts the largest capacity in the industry at 40,000 pounds.
 
Bale processors. Spread large round or square bales in the same machine attached to a skid steer, telehandler, or tractor with the patented TOP-SPREAD loader mounted spreader. The compact size fits into barns and alleyways and is easy to maneuver. On a construction site, load on a flatbed pick and cover roadsides or fresh seeding quickly from the seat of a skid steer.
 
Dirt work equipment. Level out and shape fields with the single blade or folding land planes featuring our patented floating hitch design. Reduce erosion by eliminating water pockets, furrows, and implement scars in the field. Shape yards or work sites with standard or rear steer graders that follow closely behind the tractor for leveling in smaller spaces.
 
Sugar beet harvesting equipment. We are proud to offer the best sugar beet cleaning in the industry during muddy harvest conditions with our patented grab roll bed. Our 12-row harvester has been improved with an automatic leveling system add-on for consistent digging across the field. The defoliator cleanly removes the leaves off the beets prior to digging them up for harvest. The leaves are incorporated back into the soil to provide nutrients for next year’s crop.
 
Product Distribution and Markets 
 
We distribute goods for our Agricultural Products segment primarily through a network of approximately 1,000 U.S. and Canadian independent dealers, as well as overseas dealers in Australia, Japan and the United Kingdom, whose customers require specialized agricultural machinery. We have sales representation in 48 states and seven Canadian provinces. Our dealers sell our products to various agricultural and commercial customers. We also maintain a local sales force in our Armstrong, Iowa facility to provide oversight services for our distribution network, communicate with end users, and recruit and train dealers on the uses of our products. Our local service parts staff is available to help customers and dealers with their service parts needs. Our Modular Buildings segment typically sells products customized to the end-user’s requirements directly to the end-user. Our Tools segment distributes products through manufacturers’ representatives, direct sales, and OEM sales channels.
 
We currently export products to nine foreign countries. We have been shipping grinder mixers abroad since 2006 and have exported portable rollermills and sugar beet harvesters as well. We continue to strengthen these relationships and intend to develop new international markets. Our international sales accounted for 2.6% of consolidated sales during the 2021 fiscal year compared to 3.4% in the 2020 fiscal year.

Backlog. Our backlogs of orders vary on a daily basis. As of February 2, 2022, our Tools segment had approximately $503,000 of backlog compared to $302,000 from the same date in 2021. This is the largest backlog on record for the Tools segment and while that is great news, there are capacity challenges ahead in order to fulfil these orders. In order to combat ongoing labor shortages, the Company issued a purchase order on January 31, 2022 for approximately $161,000 to purchase a Haas milling machine and robot package. Our Modular Buildings segment had approximately of $1,243,000 of backlog as of February 2, 2022, compared to $1,226,000 on that date in 2021. While the total backlog year on year is similar, the quality of margin on the 2022 backlog is much improved as approximately $496,000 of the 2021 backlog was estimated to carry a 3% margin compared to typical margin of 25%. Our Agricultural Products segment had a net backlog of approximately $10,459,000 as of February 2, 2022 compared to $6,363,000 on February 2, 2021. The continued strong demand in the Agricultural Products puts us in a position to have another successful year. We will be working to refine our process and improve our manufacturing volume outputs in fiscal 2022 to meet this added demand. On February 7, 2022 we signed a finance lease agreement to purchase three robotic weld cells for $297,600. We expect these weld robots to improve the efficiency of our weld shop and to alleviate capacity concerns related to a shortage in skilled welders. We expect that our order backlogs will continue to fluctuate as orders are received, filled, or canceled, and, due to dealer discount arrangements we may enter into from time to time, these figures are not necessarily indicative of future revenue.
Recent Product Developments
 
Throughout the 2021 fiscal year, we focused on capturing feedback from our customers to make improvements to our current long-standing reliable products and building out our line-up of quality livestock equipment for our producers. Projects include expanding our manure spreader model offerings, completing different configurations for our forage boxes and modernizing some of our manufacturing methods across all products.
 
Our Tools and Modular Buildings segments complete projects based on customer specifications and did not engage in specific product development during the 2021 fiscal year.
 
Competition
 
In addition to the competitive strengths of each of our segments described below, we believe our diversified revenue base, sales presence and customer base drawn from these three segments helps to provide protection against competitive factors in any one industry.
Agricultural Products
 
Our Agricultural Products segment competes in a highly competitive agricultural equipment industry. We compete with larger manufacturers and suppliers that have broader product offerings and significant resources at their disposal; however, we believe that our competitive strengths allow us to compete effectively in our market.
 
Management believes that grain and livestock producers, as well as those who provide services to grain and livestock operations, are the primary purchasers of agricultural equipment. Many factors influence a buyer’s choice for agricultural equipment. Any one or all factors may be determinative, but they include brand loyalty, the relationship with dealers, product quality and performance, product innovation, product availability, parts and warranty programs, price, and customer service.
 
While our larger competitors may have resources greater than ours, we believe we compete effectively in the farm equipment industry by serving smaller markets in specific product areas rather than directly competing with larger competitors across an extensive range of products. Our Agricultural Products segment caters to niche markets in the agricultural industry. We do not have a direct competitor that has the same product offerings that we do. Instead, each of our product lines competes with similar products of many other manufacturers. Some of our product lines face greater competition than others, but we believe that our products are competitively priced with greater diversity than most competitor product lines. Other companies produce feed processing equipment, sugar beet harvesting and defoliating equipment, grinders, and other products similar to ours; therefore, we focus on providing the best product available at a reasonable price. Overall, we believe our products are competitively priced with above average quality and performance, in a market where price, product performance, and quality are principal elements.
 
In addition, in order to capitalize on brand recognition for our Agricultural Products segment, we have numerous product lines produced under our own label. We also provide aftermarket service parts which are available to keep our branded and OEM-produced equipment operating to the satisfaction of the customer. We sell products to customers in the United States and nine foreign countries through a network of approximately 1,000 independent dealers in the United States and Canada, as well as overseas dealers in Australia, Japan and the United Kingdom.

We believe that our competitive pricing, product quality and performance, network of worldwide and domestic distributors, and strong market share for many of our products allow us to compete effectively in the agricultural products market.
 
Modular Buildings
 
We expect continued competition from our Modular Buildings segment’s existing competitors, which include conventional design/build firms, as well as competition from new entrants into the modular building market. To some extent, we believe barriers to entry in the modular building industry limit the competition we face in the industry. Barriers to entry in the market consist primarily of access to capital, access to a qualified labor pool, and the bidding process that accompanies many jobs in the health and education markets. Despite these barriers, manufacturers who have a skilled work force and adequate production facilities could adapt their manufacturing facilities to produce modular structures.
 
We believe the competitive strength of our Modular Buildings segment is our ability to design and produce high-tech modular buildings more quickly than conventional design/build firms. Conventional design/build construction may take two to five years, while our modular laboratories can be delivered in as little as six months. As one of the few companies in the industry to supply turnkey modular buildings and laboratories, we believe we provide high-quality buildings at reasonable prices that meet our customers’ time, flexibility, and security expectations.
 
Tools
 
We expect competition in our Tools segment from offshore products that have gained market share over the last 20 years. Our greatest threat continues to be emerging technologies that replace the need for brazed tools. These competitive threats are countered by our ability to offer the widest range of standard carbide tipped brazed tool inventories to be found in North America. These inventories are strategically located in four warehouses across the United States, enabling our customers to receive product quickly with minimal shipping costs. Our ability to produce special, engineered, value-added products in volume with short lead times sets us apart from our competitors. This is most evident in certain segments of the pipe processing industry, where we have been able to establish and maintain market share despite efforts from companies significantly larger than ourselves.
Raw Materials, Principal Suppliers, and Customers 
 
Raw materials for our various segments are acquired from domestic and foreign sources and normally are readily available. We saw lead times increase on raw materials in 2021 as labor shortages from the COVID-19 pandemic left many of our suppliers understaffed. We do rely on foreign suppliers and foreign markets for materials and components for some of our products. However, these suppliers are not principal suppliers and there are alternative sources for these materials.
 
We have an OEM supplier agreement with Case New Holland (“CNH”) for our Agricultural Products segment. Under the OEM agreement, we have agreed to supply CNH’s requirements for certain feed processing and service parts, primarily blowers, under CNH’s label. The agreement has no minimum requirements and can be cancelled upon certain conditions. The initial term of the agreement with CNH expired in September 2006, but the agreement continues in force until terminated or cancelled by either party. On October 27, 2021, the Company informed CNH that it was terminating the OEM agreement as written. The agreement remains in place for one year from date of termination. It is the expectation that the Company will enter into a new agreement with CNH at the expiration date.
 
We do not typically rely on sales to one customer or a small group of customers. During the 2021 fiscal year, one customer accounted for more than 8% consolidated net revenues.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We maintain manufacturing rights on several products, which cover unique aspects of design. We also have trademarks covering product identification. We believe our trademarks and licenses help us to retain existing business and secure new relationships with customers. The duration of these rights ranges from 5 to 10 years, with options for renewal. We currently have no pending applications for intellectual property rights.
 
We pay royalties for our use of certain manufacturing rights. Under our OEM supplier agreement with CNH, CNH sold us the license to manufacture, sell, and distribute certain plow products designed by CNH and their replacement and component parts. We pay semi-annual royalty payments based on the invoiced price of each licensed product and service part we sell. We also have a licensing and royalty agreement with Spreader, LLC to produce a loader mounted spreader in exchange for royalty payments until December 2027.

Government Relationships and Regulations; Environmental Compliance
 
Our Modular Buildings segment must design, manufacture, and install its modular buildings in accordance with state building codes, and we have been able to achieve the code standards in all instances. In addition, we are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations pertaining to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment. We do not expect that the cost of complying with these regulations will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
Employees 
 
As of November 30, 2021, we employed approximately 92 employees in our Agricultural Products segment, seven of whom were employed on a part-time basis. As of the same date, we had 25 employees in our Tools segment, one of whom was employed on a part-time basis. The majority of the employees in our Tools segment are represented by a union and covered by a collective bargaining agreement. In addition, our Modular Buildings segment employed approximately 22 full-time employees as of the same date. These numbers do not necessarily represent peak employment during the 2021 fiscal year.
