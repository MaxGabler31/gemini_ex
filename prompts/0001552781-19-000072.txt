Our markets have experienced steady economic and population growth over the past 10 years, and we expect that the areas, as well as the business and tourism industries needed to support it, will continue to grow.
 
Competition
 
The banking business is highly competitive, and we experience competition in our market areas from many other financial institutions.  Competition among financial institutions is based on interest rates offered on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans, other credit and service charges relating to loans, the quality and scope of the services rendered, the convenience of banking facilities, and, in the case of loans to commercial borrowers, relative lending limits.  We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds and other mutual funds, as well as super-regional, national and international financial institutions that operate offices in our market areas and elsewhere.
 
We compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans.  In addition, we have to attract our customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents.  Many of our competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions, such as SunTrust, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, PNC and BB&T.  These institutions offer some services, including extensive and established branch networks, that we do not provide.  In addition, many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern bank holding companies and federally insured banks.
 
Lending Activities
 
General. We emphasize a range of lending services, including commercial and residential real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, commercial and industrial loans, commercial leases, and consumer loans. Our customers are generally individuals and small to medium-sized businesses and professional firms that are located in or conduct a substantial portion of their business in our market areas. We have focused our lending activities primarily on the professional market, including doctors, dentists, small business to medium-sized owners and commercial real estate developers.
 
Certain credit risks are inherent in making loans. These include prepayment risks, risks resulting from uncertainties in the future value of collateral, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers. We attempt to mitigate repayment risks by adhering to internal credit policies and procedures. These policies and procedures include officer and customer lending limits, with approval processes for larger loans, documentation examination, and follow-up procedures for any exceptions to credit policies. Our loan approval policies provide for various levels of officer lending authority. When the amount of aggregate loans to a single borrower exceeds the maximum senior officer’s lending authority, the loan request will be considered by the management loan committee, or MLC, which is comprised of five members, all of whom are part of the senior management team of the Bank. The MLC meets weekly to approve loans with total loan commitment relationships generally exceeding $2.5 million. The loan authority of the MLC is equal to two-thirds of the legal lending limit of the Bank which is equivalent to the in-house loan limit. Total credit exposure above the in-house limit requires approval by the majority of the board of directors. We do not make any loans to any director, executive officer of the Bank, or the related interests of each, unless the loan is approved by the full Board of Directors of the Bank and is on terms not more favorable than would be available to a person not affiliated with the Bank.

Our lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by federal law. In general, the Bank is subject to a legal limit on loans to a single borrower equal to 15% of the Bank’s capital and unimpaired surplus. This legal lending limit will increase or decrease as the Bank’s level of capital increases or decreases. Based upon the capitalization of the Bank at December 31, 2018, the maximum amount we could lend to one borrower was $70.3 million. However, our internal lending limit without board of director approval at December 31, 2018 was $46.9 million. The board of directors will adjust the internal lending limit as deemed necessary to continue to mitigate risk and serve the Bank’s clients. We are able to sell participations in our larger loans to other financial institutions, which allow us to manage the risk involved in these loans and to meet the lending needs of our clients requiring extensions of credit in excess of these limits.
 
Real Estate Mortgage Loans. The principal component of our loan portfolio is loans secured by real estate mortgages. Real estate loans are subject to the same general risks as other loans and are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in the value of real estate. Fluctuations in the value of real estate, as well as other factors arising after a loan has been made, could negatively affect a borrower’s cash flow, creditworthiness, and ability to repay the loan. We obtain a security interest in real estate whenever possible, in addition to any other available collateral, in order to increase the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan.
 
These loans generally fall into one of two categories:
 

· | Residential Mortgage Loans and Home Equity Loans. We generally originate and hold short-term and long-term first mortgages and traditional second mortgage residential real estate loans. Generally, we limit the loan-to-value ratio on our residential real estate loans to 80%. Loans over 80% LTV generally require private mortgage insurance. We offer fixed and adjustable rate residential real estate loans with terms of up to 30 years. We also offer a variety of lot loan options to consumers to purchase the lot on which they intend to build their home. The options available depend on whether the borrower intends to begin building within 12 months of the lot purchase or at an undetermined future date. We also offer traditional home equity loans and lines of credit. Our underwriting criteria for, and the risks associated with, home equity loans and lines of credit are generally the same as those for first mortgage loans. Home equity loans typically have terms of 10 years or less. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Commercial Real Estate. Commercial real estate loans generally have terms of five years or less, although payments may be structured on a longer amortization basis. We evaluate each borrower on an individual basis and attempt to determine their business risks and credit profile. We attempt to reduce credit risk in the commercial real estate portfolio by emphasizing loans on owner-occupied office and retail buildings where the loan-to-value ratio, established by independent appraisals, generally does not exceed 80%. We also generally require that a borrower’s cash flow exceed 120% of monthly debt service obligations. In order to ensure secondary sources of payment and liquidity to support a loan request, we typically review all of the personal financial statements of the principal owners and require their personal guarantees. 

 
Real Estate Construction and Development Loans. We offer fixed and adjustable rate residential and commercial construction loan financing to builders and developers and to consumers who wish to build their own home. The term of construction and development loans generally is limited to 18 months, although payments may be structured on a longer amortization basis. Most loans will mature and require payment in full upon the sale of the property. We believe that construction and development loans generally carry a higher degree of risk than long-term financing of existing properties because repayment depends on the ultimate completion of the project and usually on the subsequent sale of the property. We attempt to reduce risk associated with construction and development loans by obtaining personal guarantees and by keeping the maximum loan-to-value ratio at or below 65%-80% of the lesser of cost or appraised value, depending on the project type. Generally, we do not have interest reserves built into loan commitments but require periodic cash payments for interest from the borrower’s cash flow.
 
Commercial Loans. We make loans for commercial purposes in various lines of businesses, including the manufacturing industry, service industry, and professional service areas. Commercial loans are generally considered to have greater risk than first or second mortgages on real estate because they may be unsecured, or if they are secured, the value of the collateral may be difficult to assess and more likely to decrease than real estate.

Equipment loans typically will be made for a term of 10 years or less at fixed or variable rates, with the loan fully amortized over the term and secured by the financed equipment. Generally, we limit the loan-to-value ratio on these loans to 75% of cost. Working capital loans typically have terms not exceeding one year and usually are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, or personal guarantees of the principals of the business. For loans secured by accounts receivable or inventory, principal will typically be repaid as the assets securing the loan are converted into cash, and in other cases principal will typically be due at maturity. Trade letters of credit, standby letters of credit, and foreign exchange will generally be handled through a correspondent bank as agent for the Bank.

The Company’s primary markets are generally concentrated in real estate lending. However, in order to diversify our lending portfolio, the Company purchases nationally syndicated commercial and industrial loans. These loans typically have terms of seven years and are generally tied to a floating rate index such as LIBOR or prime. To effectively manage this line of business, the Company has an experienced senior lending executive who leads a team with relevant experience to manage this area of this segment of the loan portfolio. In addition, the Company engaged a consulting firm that specializes in syndicated loans to assist in monitoring performance analytics. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, there were approximately $99.8 million and $75.0 million in broadly syndicated loans outstanding. Syndicated loans are grouped within commercial business loans.
 
The Bank began originating leases, primarily on equipment utilized for business purposes, as a result of the First South acquisition. Lease terms generally range from 12 to 60 months and include options to purchase the leased equipment at the end of the lease. Most leases provide 100% of the cost of the equipment and are secured by the leased equipment. The Company requires the leased equipment to be insured and that we be listed as a loss payee and named as an additional insured on the insurance policy. We manage credit risk associated with our lease financing loan class based upon the dollar amount of the lease and the level of credit risk. We follow a formal review process that entails analysis of the following factors: equipment value/residual value, exposure levels, jurisdiction risk, industry risk, guarantor requirements, and regulatory compliance. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, there were approximately $23.1 million and $24.0 million in lease receivables outstanding. Lease receivables are grouped within commercial business loans. 
 
Consumer Loans. We make a variety of loans to individuals for personal and household purposes, including secured and unsecured installment loans and revolving lines of credit. Consumer loans are underwritten based on the borrower’s income, current debt level, past credit history, and the availability and value of collateral. Consumer rates are both fixed and variable, with negotiable terms. Our installment loans generally amortize over periods up to 72 months. Although we typically require monthly payments of interest and a portion of the principal on our loan products, we will offer consumer loans with a single maturity date when a specific source of repayment is available. Consumer loans are generally considered to have greater risk than first or second mortgages on real estate because they may be unsecured, or, if they are secured, the value of the collateral may be difficult to assess and more likely to decrease in value than real estate.
 
Mortgage Operations
 
Mortgage Activities and Servicing. Our correspondent/wholesale mortgage banking operations are conducted through our mortgage origination subsidiary, Crescent Mortgage Company. Mortgage activities involve the purchase of mortgage loans and table funded originations for the purpose of generating gains on sales of loans and fee income on the origination of loans and is included in mortgage banking income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. While the Company originates residential one-to-four family loans that are held in its loan portfolio, the majority of new loans are generally sold pursuant to secondary market guidelines through Crescent Mortgage Company. Generally, residential mortgage loans are sold and, depending on the pricing in the marketplace, servicing rights are either sold or retained. The level of loan sale activity and its contribution to the Company’s profitability depends on maintaining a sufficient volume of loan originations and margin. Changes in the level of interest rates and the local economy affect the volume of loans originated by the Company and the amount of loan sales and loan fees earned.
 
Loan Servicing. We retain the rights to service a portion of the loans we sell on the secondary market, as part of our mortgage banking activities, for which we receive service fee income. In addition, at certain times we may purchase rights to service from third parties. These rights are known as mortgage servicing rights, (or “MSRs”), where the owner of the MSR acts on behalf of the mortgage loan owner and has the contractual right to receive a stream of cash flows in exchange for performing specified mortgage servicing functions. These duties typically include, but are not limited to, performing loan administration, collection, and default activities, including the collection and remittance of loan payments, responding to customer inquiries, accounting for principal and interest, holding custodial (impound) funds for the payment of property taxes and insurance premiums, counseling delinquent mortgagors, modifying loans and supervising foreclosures and property dispositions. We subservice the duties and responsibilities obligated to the owner of the MSR to a third party provider for which we pay a fee.
 
Deposit Products
 
We provide a range of deposit services, including noninterest-bearing demand accounts, interest-bearing demand and savings accounts, money market accounts and time deposits. These accounts generally pay interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and management’s desire to increase or decrease certain types or maturities of deposits. Deposits continue to be our primary funding source. At December 31, 2018, deposits totaled $2.7 billion, an increase from deposits of $2.6 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase in deposits since December 31, 2017 relates to continued efforts to increase our deposits through business development and seasonal increases in markets affected by tourism.

Emerging Growth Company
 
On December 31, 2018, our status as an “emerging growth company”, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), terminated because the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million on June 30, 2018.  As an “emerging growth company,” we took advantage of some reduced disclosure and other requirements that were otherwise applicable generally to public companies.  As a result, the information that we provided to our stockholders prior to this report may be different from the information provided by other public reporting companies.  With the filing of this report, we began providing the information required from “large accelerated filers” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act in periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.
Employees
 
As of February 25, 2019, we had 773 total employees, including 735 full-time employees.
 
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 
Both the Company and the Bank are subject to extensive state and federal banking laws and regulations that impose restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of their operations.  These laws and regulations generally are intended to protect consumers and depositors and not stockholders.  The following summary is qualified by reference to the statutory and regulatory provisions discussed.  Changes in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects.  Our operations may be affected by legislative changes and the policies of various regulatory authorities.  We cannot predict the effect that fiscal or monetary policies, economic control or new federal or state legislation may have on our business and earnings in the future.
 
The following discussion is not intended to be a complete list of all the activities regulated by the banking laws or of the impact of those laws and regulations on our operations.  It is intended only to briefly summarize some material provisions.
 
Recent Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives
 
Banking statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. In addition to laws and regulations, state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. Any change in the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies applicable to us, including changes in their interpretation or implementation, could have a material effect on our business and organization.
 
Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of supervision to which we are subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial crisis, as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, most of which are now in place. President Trump has issued an executive order that sets forth principles for the reform of the federal financial regulatory framework, and Congress has also suggested an agenda for financial regulatory change. It is too early to assess whether there will be any major changes in the regulatory environment or merely a rebalancing of the post financial crisis framework. The Company expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision.
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which was signed into law in 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), among other things, changes the oversight and supervision of financial institutions, includes new minimum capital requirements, creates a new federal agency to regulate consumer financial products and services and implements changes to corporate governance and compensation practices. The Dodd-Frank Act is focused in large part on the financial services industry, particularly bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, and contains a number of provisions that will affect us, including:
 
Minimum Leverage and Risk-Based Capital Requirements. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal banking agencies are required to establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements on a consolidated basis for all insured depository institutions and bank holding companies, which can be no less than the currently applicable leverage and risk-based capital requirements for depository institutions. As a result, the Bank will be subject to at least the same capital requirements and must include the same components in regulatory capital.

Deposit Insurance Modifications. The Dodd-Frank Act modified the FDIC’s assessment base upon which deposit insurance premiums are calculated. The new assessment base equals our average total consolidated assets minus the sum of our average tangible equity during the assessment period. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently raised the standard maximum insurance amount to $250,000.
 
Creation of New Governmental Authorities. The Dodd-Frank Act created various new governmental authorities such as the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), an independent regulatory authority housed within the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The CFPB has broad authority to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products. The CFPB officially came into being on July 21, 2011, and rulemaking authority for a range of consumer financial protection laws (such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, among others) transferred from the Federal Reserve and other federal regulators to the CFPB on that date. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to supervise and examine depository institutions with more than $10 billion in assets for compliance with these federal consumer laws. The authority to supervise and examine depository institutions with $10 billion or less in assets for compliance with federal consumer laws will remain largely with those institutions’ primary regulators. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations of these smaller institutions on a “sampling basis” and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. The CFPB also has supervisory and examination authority over certain nonbank institutions that offer consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act identifies a number of covered nonbank institutions, and also authorizes the CFPB to identify additional institutions that will be subject to its jurisdiction. Accordingly, the CFPB may participate in examinations of the Bank, which currently has assets of less than $10 billion, and could supervise and examine our other direct or indirect subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products or services. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB against certain institutions.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act also authorized the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, financial institutions may not make a residential mortgage loan unless they make a “reasonable and good faith determination” that the consumer has a “reasonable ability” to repay the loan. The Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure but provides a full or partial safe harbor from such defenses for loans that are “qualified mortgages.” On January 10, 2013, the CFPB published final rules to, among other things, specify the types of income and assets that may be considered in the ability-to-repay determination, the permissible sources for verification, and the required methods of calculating the loan’s monthly payments. Since then the CFPB made certain modifications to these rules. The rules extend the requirement that creditors verify and document a borrower’s “income and assets” to include all “information” that creditors rely on in determining repayment ability. The rules also provide further examples of third-party documents that may be relied on for such verification, such as government records and check-cashing or funds-transfer service receipts. The rules took effect January 10, 2014. The rules also define “qualified mortgages,” imposing both underwriting standards - for example, a borrower’s debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43% - and limits on the terms of their loans. Points and fees are subject to a relatively stringent cap, and the terms include a wide array of payments that may be made in the course of closing a loan. Certain loans, including interest-only loans and negative amortization loans, cannot be qualified mortgages.
 
Executive Compensation and Corporate Governance Requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to include, at least once every three years, a separate non-binding “say on pay” vote in their proxy statement by which stockholders may vote on the compensation of the company’s named executive officers. In addition, if such companies are involved in a merger, acquisition, or consolidation, or if they propose to sell or dispose of all or substantially all of their assets, stockholders have a right to an advisory vote on any golden parachute arrangements in connection with such transaction (frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” vote). Other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may impact our corporate governance. For instance, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the SEC to adopt rules:
 

· | prohibiting the listing of any equity security of a company that does not have an independent compensation committee; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | requiring all exchange-traded companies to adopt claw-back policies for incentive compensation paid to executive officers in the event of accounting restatements based on material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements. 

 
The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes the SEC to issue rules allowing stockholders to include their own nominations for directors in a company’s proxy solicitation materials. Many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act require the adoption of additional rules to implement the changes. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act mandates multiple studies that could result in additional legislative action. Governmental intervention and new regulations under these programs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 
Regulatory capital rules released by the federal bank regulatory agencies in July 2013 to implement capital standards, referred to as Basel III and developed by an international body known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, impose higher minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with more than $1 billion in total consolidated assets. We collectively refer to these organizations herein as “covered” banking organizations. In certain respects, the rules impose more stringent requirements on “advanced approaches” banking organizations—those organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets, $10 billion or more in total foreign exposures, or that have opted in to the Basel II capital regime. The requirements in the rules began to phase in on January 1, 2014 for advanced approaches banking organizations, and on January 1, 2015 for other covered banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank. The requirements in the rules were fully phased in by January 1, 2019.
 
The rules impose new and higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those previously in place. Specifically, the following minimum capital requirements apply to us:
 

· | a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; 
--+--------------------------------------------------
· | a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; 
· | a total capital ratio of 8%; and 
· | a leverage ratio of 4%. 

 
Under the rules, Tier 1 capital is redefined to include two components: Common Equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The new and highest form of capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital includes other perpetual instruments historically included in Tier 1 capital, such as non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. The rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets to continue to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 capital, but not in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, subject to certain restrictions. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that currently qualify in Tier 2 capital plus instruments that the rule has disqualified from Tier 1 capital treatment. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock, formerly includable in Tier 1 capital is now included only in Tier 2 capital. Accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) is presumptively included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. The rules provided for a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organization to opt-out of much of this treatment of AOCI. We made this opt-out election and, as a result, will retain the pre-existing treatment for AOCI.
 
In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a “capital conservation buffer” on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 common equity, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The capital conservation buffer was phased in incrementally over time, becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019, and consists of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-based assets. As of January 1, 2018, we are required to hold a capital conservation buffer of 1.875%, increasing to 2.5% effective January 1, 2019.
 
In general, the rules have had the effect of increasing capital requirements by increasing the risk weights on certain assets, including high volatility commercial real estate, certain loans past due 90 days or more or in nonaccrual status, mortgage servicing rights not includable in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, equity exposures, and claims on securities firms, that are used in the denominator of the three risk-based capital ratios. 
 
Volcker Rule
 
Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the “Volcker Rule,” prohibits any bank, bank holding company, or affiliate (referred to collectively as “banking entities”) from engaging in two types of activities: “proprietary trading” and the ownership or sponsorship of private equity or hedge funds that are referred to as “covered funds.” Proprietary trading includes the purchase or sale of principal of any security, derivative, commodity future, or option on any such instrument for the purpose of benefitting from short-term price movements or realizing short-term profits. In December 2013, our primary federal regulators, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, together with other federal banking agencies and the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, finalized a regulation to implement the Volcker Rule.
 
Exceptions apply, however. Trading in U.S. Treasuries, obligations or other instruments issued by a government sponsored enterprise, state or municipal obligations, or obligations of the FDIC is permitted. A banking entity also may trade for the purpose of managing its liquidity, provided that it has a bona fide liquidity management plan. Trading activities as agent, broker or custodian; through a deferred compensation or pension plan; as trustee or fiduciary on behalf of customers; in order to satisfy a debt previously contracted; or in repurchase and securities lending agreements are permitted. Additionally, the Volcker Rule permits banking entities to engage in trading that takes the form of risk-mitigating hedging activities.

--

The covered funds that a banking entity may not sponsor or hold an ownership interest in are, with certain exceptions, funds that are exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 because they either have 100 or fewer investors or are owned exclusively by “qualified investors” (generally, high net worth individuals or entities). Wholly-owned subsidiaries, joint ventures and acquisition vehicles, foreign pension or retirement funds, insurance company separate accounts (including bank-owned life insurance), public welfare investment funds, and entities formed by the FDIC for the purpose of disposing of assets are not covered funds, and a bank may invest in them. Most securitizations also are not treated as covered funds.
 
As issued on December 10, 2013, the regulation treated collateralized debt obligations backed by trust preferred securities as covered funds and accordingly subject to divestiture. In an interim final rule issued on January 14, 2014, the agencies exempted collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, issued before May 19, 2010, that were backed by trust preferred securities issued before the same date by a bank with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion or by a mutual holding company, and that the bank holding the CDO interest had purchased before December 10, 2013, from the Volcker Rule prohibition. This exemption does not extend to CDOs backed by trust-preferred securities issued by an insurance company.


Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
 
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law. The Tax Act includes a number of provisions that impact us, including the following:

· | Tax Rate. The Tax Act replaces the graduated corporate tax rates applicable under prior law, which imposed a maximum tax rate of 35%, with a reduced 21% flat tax rate. Although the reduced tax rate generally should be favorable to us by resulting in increased earnings and capital, it will decrease the value of our existing deferred tax assets. Generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) require that the impact of the provisions of the Tax Act be accounted for in the period of enactment. Accordingly, the Company’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was reduced by approximately $239,000, primarily due to a lower valuation of deferred income taxes. See “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Results of Operations – Income Tax Expense.” 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Employee Compensation. A “publicly held corporation” is not permitted to deduct compensation in excess of $1 million per year paid to certain employees. The Tax Act eliminates certain exceptions to the $1 million limit applicable under prior to law related to performance-based compensation, such as equity grants and cash bonuses that are paid only on the attainment of performance goals. As a result, our ability to deduct certain compensation that may be paid to our most highly compensated employees will now be limited. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Business Asset Expensing. The Tax Act allows taxpayers immediately to expense the entire cost (instead of only 50%, as under prior law) of certain depreciable tangible property and real property improvements acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017 and before January 1, 2023 (with an additional year for certain property). This 100% “bonus” depreciation is phased out proportionately for property placed in service on or after January 1, 2023 and before January 1, 2027 (with an additional year for certain property). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Interest Expense. The Tax Act limits a taxpayer’s annual deduction of business interest expense to the sum of (i) business interest income and (ii) 30% of “adjusted taxable income,” defined as a business’s taxable income without taking into account business interest income or expense, net operating losses, and, for 2018 through 2021, depreciation, amortization and depletion. Because we generate significant amounts of net interest income, we do not expect to be impacted by this limitation. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposed Legislation and Regulatory Action
 
From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or the Bank could have a material effect on the business of the Company.
 
On May 24, 2018, President Trump signed into law the “Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act” (the “Regulatory Relief Act”), which amends parts of the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as other laws that involve regulation of the financial industry. While the Regulatory Relief Act keeps in place fundamental aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act’s regulatory framework, it does change the regulatory framework for depository institutions with assets under $10 billion, such as the Bank, and for large depository institutions with assets over $50 billion. The legislation includes a number of provisions which are favorable to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, such as the Company, and also makes changes to consumer mortgage and credit reporting regulations and to the authorities of the agencies that regulate the financial industry. A number of the provisions included in the Regulatory Relief Act require the federal banking agencies to either promulgate regulations or amend existing regulations, and it will likely take some time for these agencies to implement the necessary changes.
  
11
--

The following is a brief summary of select provisions of the Regulatory Relief Act.
 

· | Modified Process for Designating Systemically Important Financial Institutions. The Regulatory Relief Act changes which bank holding companies will be designated as a systemically important financial institution (“SIFI”). Prior to passage of the Regulatory Relief Act, all bank holding companies with assets exceeding $50 billion were automatically designated as SIFIs and were subject to the enhanced prudential standards (“EPS”) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which required these bank holding companies to undergo special stress tests, develop resolution plans, and maintain certain levels of liquidity and financial capacity to absorb losses. The Regulatory Relief Act raised the $50 billion SIFI threshold to $250 billion, but staggered the application of this change for certain institutions, based on size. Upon enactment, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $100 billion are no longer subject to the EPS of the Dodd-Frank Act. Bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of more than $100 billion but less than $250 billion will no longer be subject to such requirements, beginning 18 months after the date of enactment. Because the Regulatory Relief Act does not amend the regulations that the federal banking agencies have promulgated to implement the EPS, it will likely take some time for these agencies to amend their regulations to account for the new thresholds included in the Regulatory Relief Act. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Many of the changes in the Regulatory Relief Act amend provisions of Dodd-Frank Act that apply at the bank holding company level, but not to subsidiary national banks or other insured depository institutions. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or the OCC, and the FDIC have adopted their own counterparts to some EPS for the bank subsidiaries that they regulate, including recovery and resolution planning. The OCC and the FDIC will need to address whether they intend to take similar measures under their regulations and guidance to align asset thresholds with what is reflected in the Regulatory Relief Act.
 

· | Provisions that are Favorable to Regional Banks. There are a number of provisions in the Regulatory Relief Act that will have a favorable impact on community banks such as the Bank. These are briefly referenced below. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Elimination of Company-Run Stress Tests. The Regulatory Relief Act exempts all banking organizations with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets from the current requirement to conduct company-run stress tests. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Increase in Asset Threshold for Requirement to Establish a Risk Committee. The Regulatory Relief Act raises the asset threshold for the requirement that a publicly-traded bank holding company establish a risk committee from $10 billion to $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Short Form Call Reports. The Regulatory Relief Act requires the federal banking agencies to promulgate regulations allowing an insured depository institution with less than $5 billion in total consolidated assets (and that satisfies such other criteria as determined to be appropriate by the agencies) to submit a short-form call report for its first and third quarters of a calendar year. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Consumer Protection Enhancements. The Regulatory Relief Act includes various provisions to address consumer protection challenges facing the credit reporting industry and borrowers in certain credit markets, specifically markets including active duty service members, veterans, and student loan borrowers. The Regulatory Relief Act subjects credit reporting agencies to additional requirements, including requirements to generally provide fraud alerts for consumer files for at least one year and to allow consumers to place security freezes on their credit reports. The Regulatory Relief Act also allows consumers to request that information related to a default on a qualified private student loan be removed from a credit report if the borrower satisfies the requirements of a loan rehabilitation program offered by a private lender. The Regulatory Relief Act prohibits lenders from declaring automatic default in the case of death or bankruptcy of the co-signer of a student loan and requires lenders to release cosigners from obligations related to a student loan in the event of the death of the student borrower. In addition, credit reporting agencies will be required to exclude certain medical debt from veterans’ credit reports.

Carolina Financial Corporation
 
The Company owns 100% of the outstanding capital stock of the Bank, and therefore is required to be and is registered as a bank holding company under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHCA”). As a result, the Company is primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve under the BHCA and its regulations promulgated thereunder. Moreover, as a bank holding company of a bank located in South Carolina, the Company also is subject to the South Carolina Banking and Branching Efficiency Act.
 
Permitted Activities. Under the BHCA, a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in, or acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in the following activities:
 

· | banking or managing or controlling banks; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | furnishing services to or performing services for our subsidiaries; and 
· | any activity that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking. 

 
Activities that the Federal Reserve has found to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking include:
 

· | factoring accounts receivable; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities; 
· | leasing personal or real property; 
· | operating a non-bank depository institution, such as a savings association; 
· | trust company functions; 
· | financial and investment advisory activities; 
· | conducting discount securities brokerage activities; 
· | underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments; 
· | providing specified management consulting and counseling activities; 
· | performing selected data processing services and support services; 
· | acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions; and 
· | performing selected insurance underwriting activities. 

 
A bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including that its depository institutions subsidiaries are “well capitalized” and “well managed,” can opt to become a “financial holding company.” On June 20, 2017, an election submitted by the Company to become a financial holding company was declared effective by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. As a financial holding company, we are now permitted to engage in a broader array of activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complimentary to financial activities, including insurance underwriting, sales and brokerage activities, providing financial and investment advisory services, underwriting services and limited merchant banking activities.
 
The Federal Reserve has the authority to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company’s continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries.
 
Change in Control. Two statutes, the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act (the “CBCA”), together with regulations promulgated under them, require some form of regulatory review before any company may acquire “control” of a bank or a bank holding company. Under the BHCA, control is deemed to exist if a company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank holding company; controls the election of a majority of the members of the board of directors; or exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of a bank or bank holding company. In guidance issued in 2008, the Federal Reserve has stated that it would not expect control to exist if a person acquires, in aggregate, less than 33% of the total equity of a bank or bank holding company (voting and nonvoting equity), provided such person’s ownership does not include 15% or more of any class of voting securities. Prior Federal Reserve approval is necessary before an entity acquires sufficient control to become a bank holding company. Natural persons, certain non-business trusts, and other entities are not treated as companies (or bank holding companies), and their acquisitions are not subject to review under the BHCA. State laws generally, including South Carolina law, require state approval before an acquirer may become the holding company of a state bank.
  
13
--

Under the CBCA, a person or company is required to file a notice with the Federal Reserve if it will, as a result of the transaction, own or control 10% or more of any class of voting securities or direct the management or policies of a bank or bank holding company and either if the bank or bank holding company has registered securities or if the acquirer would be the largest holder of that class of voting securities after the acquisition. For a change in control at the holding company level, both the Federal Reserve and the subsidiary bank’s primary federal regulator must approve the change in control; at the bank level, only the bank’s primary federal regulator is involved. Transactions subject to the BHCA are exempt from CBCA requirements. For state banks, state laws, including that of South Carolina, typically require approval by the state bank regulator as well.
 
Source of Strength. There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed by law and regulatory policy on bank holding companies with regard to their depository institution subsidiaries that are designed to minimize potential loss to depositors and to the FDIC insurance funds in the event that the depository institution becomes in danger of defaulting under its obligations to repay deposits. In accordance with Federal Reserve policy, the Company is required to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances in which it might not otherwise do so. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporate Improvement Act of 1991, or FDICIA, to avoid receivership of its insured depository institution subsidiary, a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any insured depository institution subsidiary that may become “undercapitalized” within the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal banking agency up to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5% of the institution’s total assets at the time the institution became undercapitalized, or (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all applicable capital standards as of the time the institution fails to comply with such capital restoration plan.
 
Under the BHCA, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a non-bank subsidiary, other than a non-bank subsidiary of a bank, upon the Federal Reserve’s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or stability of any depository institution subsidiary of a bank holding company. Further, federal bank regulatory authorities have additional discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or non-bank subsidiaries if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institution’s financial condition.
 
In addition, the “cross guarantee” provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, (“FDIA”), require insured depository institutions under common control to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered or reasonably anticipated by the FDIC as a result of the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default. The FDIC’s claim for damages is superior to claims of stockholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company, but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured depository institutions.
 
The FDIA also provides that amounts received from the liquidation or other resolution of any insured depository institution by any receiver must be distributed (after payment of secured claims) to pay the deposit liabilities of the institution prior to payment of any other general or unsecured senior liability, subordinated liability, general creditor or stockholder. This provision would give depositors a preference over general and subordinated creditors and stockholders in the event a receiver is appointed to distribute the assets of the Bank.
 
Further, any capital loans by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank at a certain level would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority payment. 
 
Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve imposes certain capital requirements on the bank holding company under the BHCA, including a minimum leverage ratio and a minimum ratio of “qualifying” capital to risk-weighted assets. These requirements are essentially the same as those that apply to the Bank and are described below under “CresCom Bank.” Subject to our capital requirements and certain other restrictions, we are able to borrow money to make a capital contribution to the Bank, and these loans may be repaid from dividends paid from the Bank to the Company. We are also able to raise capital for contribution to the Bank by issuing securities without having to receive regulatory approval, subject to compliance with federal and state securities laws.
 
Dividends. Since the Company is a bank holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal and state regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve’s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve’s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. Further, under the prompt corrective action regulations, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
  
14
--

In addition, since the Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and does not conduct stand-alone operations, its ability to pay dividends depends on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to it, which is also subject to regulatory restrictions as described below in “CresCom Bank – Dividends.”
 
South Carolina State Regulation. As a South Carolina bank holding company under the South Carolina Banking and Branching Efficiency Act, we are subject to limitations on sale or merger and to regulation by the South Carolina Board of Financial Institutions (the “SCBFI”). We are not required to obtain the approval of the SCBFI prior to acquiring the capital stock of a national bank, but we must notify them at least 15 days prior to doing so. We must obtain approval from the SCBFI prior to engaging in the acquisition of branches, a South Carolina state chartered bank, or another South Carolina bank holding company.
 
CresCom Bank
 
The Bank’s primary federal regulator is the FDIC. In addition, the Bank is regulated and examined by the SCBFI. Deposits in the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to a maximum amount of $250,000 per depositor, per ownership category, pursuant to the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.
 
The SCBFI and the FDIC regulate or monitor virtually all areas of the Bank’s operations, including:
 

· | security devices and procedures; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | adequacy of capitalization and loss reserves; 
· | loans; 
· | investments; 
· | borrowings; 
· | deposits; 
· | mergers; 
· | issuances of securities; 
· | payment of dividends; 
· | interest rates payable on deposits; 
· | interest rates or fees chargeable on loans; 
· | establishment of branches; 
· | corporate reorganizations; 
· | maintenance of books and records; and 
· | adequacy of staff training to carry on safe lending and deposit gathering practices. 

 
These agencies, and the federal and state laws applicable to the Bank’s operations, extensively regulate various aspects of our banking business, including among other things, permissible types and amounts of loans, investments, and other activities, capital adequacy, branching, interest rates on loans and deposits, maintenance of reserves and the safety and soundness of our banking practices. See additional discussion related to Basel III above.
 
All insured institutions must undergo regular on-site examinations by their appropriate banking agency. The cost of examinations of insured depository institutions and any affiliates may be assessed by the appropriate federal banking agency against each institution or affiliate as it deems necessary or appropriate. Insured institutions are required to submit annual reports to the FDIC, their federal regulatory agency, and state supervisor when applicable. The FDIC has developed a method for insured depository institutions to provide supplemental disclosure of the estimated fair market value of assets and liabilities, to the extent feasible and practicable, in any balance sheet, financial statement, report of condition or any other report of any insured depository institution. The federal banking regulatory agencies prescribe, by regulation, standards for all insured depository institutions and depository institution holding companies relating, among other things, to the following:
 

· | internal controls; 
--+---------------------------------------
· | information systems and audit systems;
· | loan documentation; 
· | credit underwriting; 
· | interest rate risk exposure; and 
· | asset quality.

Prompt Corrective Action. As an insured depository institution, the Bank is required to comply with the capital requirements promulgated under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the prompt corrective action regulations thereunder, which set forth five capital categories, each with specific regulatory consequences. Under these regulations, the categories are:
 

· | Well Capitalized — The institution exceeds the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. A well capitalized institution (i) has a total capital ratio of 10% or greater, (ii) has a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% or greater, (iii) has a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, (iv) has a leverage ratio of 5% or greater, and (v) is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Adequately Capitalized — The institution meets the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure. No capital distribution may be made that would result in the institution becoming undercapitalized. An adequately capitalized institution (i) has a total capital ratio of 8% or greater, (ii) has a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% or greater, (iii) has a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, and (iv) has a leverage ratio of 4% or greater. 
· | Undercapitalized — The institution fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure. An undercapitalized institution (i) has a total capital ratio of less than 8%, (ii) has a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 6%, (iii) has a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4.5%, or (iv) has a leverage ratio of less than 4%. 
· | Significantly Undercapitalized — The institution is significantly below the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure. A significantly undercapitalized institution (i) has a total capital ratio of less than 6%, (ii) has a Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4%, (iii) has a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 3%, or (iv) has a leverage ratio of less than 3%. 
· | Critically Undercapitalized — The institution fails to meet a critical capital level set by the appropriate federal banking agency. A critically undercapitalized institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%. 

 
If the applicable federal regulator determines, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition, the regulator is authorized to reclassify the institution to the next lower capital category.
 
If the FDIC determines, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, that a bank is in an unsafe or unsound condition, the regulator is authorized to reclassify the bank to the next lower capital category (other than critically undercapitalized) and require the submission of a plan to correct the unsafe or unsound condition.
 
If a bank is not well capitalized, it cannot accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. In addition, a bank that is not well capitalized cannot offer an effective yield in excess of 75 basis points over interest paid on deposits of comparable size and maturity in such institution’s normal market area for deposits accepted from within its normal market area, or national rate paid on deposits of comparable size and maturity for deposits accepted outside the bank’s normal market area. Moreover, the FDIC generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be categorized as undercapitalized. Undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations (an undercapitalized institution may not acquire another institution, establish additional branch offices or engage in any new line of business unless determined by the appropriate federal banking agency to be consistent with an accepted capital restoration plan, or unless the FDIC determines that the proposed action will further the purpose of prompt corrective action) and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The agencies may not accept a capital restoration plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with the capital restoration plan. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of an amount equal to 5.0% of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became categorized as undercapitalized or the amount that is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is categorized as significantly undercapitalized.
 
Significantly undercapitalized categorized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become categorized as adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. The appropriate federal banking agency may take any action authorized for a significantly undercapitalized institution if an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails in any material respect to implement a plan accepted by the agency. A critically undercapitalized institution is subject to having a receiver or conservator appointed to manage its affairs and for loss of its charter to conduct banking activities.

An insured depository institution may not pay a management fee to a bank holding company controlling that institution or any other person having control of the institution if, after making the payment, the institution would be undercapitalized. In addition, an institution cannot make a capital distribution, such as a dividend or other distribution that is in substance a distribution of capital to the owners of the institution if following such a distribution the institution would be undercapitalized. Thus, if payment of such a management fee or the making of such would cause a bank to become undercapitalized, it could not pay a management fee or dividend to the bank holding company.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was deemed to be “well capitalized.”
 
Standards for Safety and Soundness. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act also requires the federal banking regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (i) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest rate risk exposure; and (v) asset growth. The agencies also must prescribe standards for asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation, as well as standards for compensation, fees and benefits. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if the FDIC determines that the Bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the Bank to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard, as required by the FDIC. The final regulations establish deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans.
 
Regulatory Examination. The FDIC also requires the Bank to prepare annual reports on the Bank’s financial condition and to conduct an annual audit of its financial affairs in compliance with its minimum standards and procedures.
 
All insured institutions must undergo regular on-site examinations by their appropriate banking agency. The cost of examinations of insured depository institutions and any affiliates may be assessed by the appropriate federal banking agency against each institution or affiliate as it deems necessary or appropriate. Insured institutions are required to submit annual reports to the FDIC, their federal regulatory agency, and state supervisor when applicable. The FDIC has developed a method for insured depository institutions to provide supplemental disclosure of the estimated fair market value of assets and liabilities, to the extent feasible and practicable, in any balance sheet, financial statement, report of condition or any other report of any insured depository institution. The federal banking regulatory agencies prescribe, by regulation, standards for all insured depository institutions and depository institution holding companies relating, among other things, to the following:
 

· | internal controls; 
--+-------------------------------------------
· | information systems and audit systems; 
· | loan documentation; 
· | credit underwriting; 
· | interest rate risk exposure; and 
· | asset quality. 

 
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and its other subsidiaries. Various legal limitations restrict the Bank from lending or otherwise supplying funds to the Company or its non-bank subsidiaries. The Company and the Bank are subject to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation W.
 
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act places limits on the amount of loans or extensions of credit by a bank to any affiliate, including its holding company, and on a bank’s investments in, or certain other transactions with, affiliates and on the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of any affiliates of the bank. Section 23A also applies to derivative transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions that cause a bank to have credit exposure to an affiliate. The aggregate of all covered transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. Furthermore, within the foregoing limitations as to amount, each covered transaction must meet specified collateral requirements. The Bank is forbidden to purchase low quality assets from an affiliate.

Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, among other things, prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with certain affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to such institution or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies.
 
Regulation W generally excludes all non-bank and non-savings association subsidiaries of banks from treatment as affiliates, except to the extent that the Federal Reserve decides to treat these subsidiaries as affiliates.
 
The Bank is also subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, certain principal stockholders, and their related interests. Such extensions of credit (i) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral requirements, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated third parties and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
 
Dividends. The Company’s principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to its stockholders, is dividends it receives from the Bank. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to the Bank’s payment of dividends to the Company. As a South Carolina chartered bank, the Bank is subject to limitations on the amount of dividends that it is permitted to pay. Unless otherwise instructed by the SCBFI, the Bank is generally permitted under South Carolina state banking regulations to pay cash dividends of up to 100% of net income in any calendar year without obtaining the prior approval of the SCBFI. The FDIC also has the authority under federal law to enjoin a bank from engaging in what in its opinion constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business, including the payment of a dividend under certain circumstances.
 
Branching. Federal legislation permits out-of-state acquisitions by bank holding companies, interstate branching by banks, and interstate merging by banks. The Dodd-Frank Act removed previous state law restrictions on de novo interstate branching in states such as South Carolina. This change effectively permits out-of-state banks to open de novo branches in states where the laws of such state would permit a bank chartered by that state to open a de novo branch.
 
Anti-Tying Restrictions. Under amendments to the BHCA and Federal Reserve regulations, a bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying or reciprocity arrangements with its customers. In general, a bank may not extend credit, lease, sell property, or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for these on the condition that (i) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or services from or to the bank, the bank holding company or subsidiaries thereof or (ii) the customer may not obtain some other credit, property, or services from a competitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended. Certain arrangements are permissible: a bank may offer combined-balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products; and certain foreign transactions are exempt from the general rule. A bank holding company or any bank affiliate also is subject to anti-tying requirements in connection with electronic benefit transfer services.
 
Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act, (or “CRA”), requires that the FDIC evaluate the record of the Bank in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could impose additional requirements and limitations on our Bank.
 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, (or “GLBA”), made various changes to the CRA. Among other changes, CRA agreements with private parties must be disclosed and annual CRA reports must be made available to a bank’s primary federal regulator. A bank holding company will not be permitted to become a financial holding company and no new activities authorized under the GLBA may be commenced by a holding company or by a bank financial subsidiary if any of its bank subsidiaries received less than a satisfactory CRA rating in its latest CRA examination.
 
On May 21, 2018, the “as of” date of its most recent examination, the Bank received a “satisfactory” CRA rating.
 
Financial Subsidiaries. Under the GLBA, subject to certain conditions imposed by their respective banking regulators, national and state-chartered banks are permitted to form “financial subsidiaries” that may conduct financial or incidental activities, thereby permitting bank subsidiaries to engage in certain activities that previously were impermissible. The GLBA imposes several safeguards and restrictions on financial subsidiaries, including that the parent bank’s equity investment in the financial subsidiary be deducted from the bank’s assets and tangible equity for purposes of calculating the bank’s capital adequacy. In addition, the GLBA imposes new restrictions on transactions between a bank and its financial subsidiaries similar to restrictions applicable to transactions between banks and non-bank affiliates.

Consumer Protection Regulations. Activities of the Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. The Bank’s loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as:
 

· | the Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 
· | the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 
· | the Community Reinvestment Act, encourages banks to help meet the credit needs of their entire community, including low- and moderate-income areas consistent with safe and sound lending practices; 
· | the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act and Regulation V, as well as the rules and regulations of the FDIC, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies, certain identity theft protections and certain credit and other disclosures; 
 | the Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; 
· | the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, which governs aspects of the settlement process for residential mortgage loans. 
· | the Military Lending Act and Service Members Civil Relief Act both protect active duty members and their families from certain lending practices in consumer credit and provide meaningful benefits for Service Members; and 
· | the rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. 

 
The deposit operations of the Bank also are subject to:
 

· | the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services. 
· | the Expedited Funds Availability Act, Regulation CC, establishes time limits the bank must follow for making check deposits available for withdrawal or transfer; and 
· | the Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD, which requires depositary institutions to provide certain consumer disclosures. 

 
Anti-Money Laundering. Financial institutions must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures, and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. The Company and the Bank are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and “knowing your customer” in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions, and recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks. Anti-money laundering obligations have been substantially strengthened as a result of the USA Patriot Act, enacted in 2001 and renewed in 2006. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications. The regulatory authorities have been active in imposing cease and desist orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions that have not complied with these requirements.
 
USA PATRIOT Act/Bank Secrecy Act. The USA PATRIOT Act, amended, in part, the Bank Secrecy Act and provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering by enhancing anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws, as well as enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the U.S. government, including: (i) requiring standards for verifying customer identification at account opening; (ii) rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering; (iii) reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for transactions exceeding $10,000; and (iv) filing suspicious activities reports if a bank believes a customer may be violating U.S. laws and regulations and requires enhanced due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer, maintain, or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non-U.S. persons. The rule was further enhanced in 2018 by requiring the identification of beneficial owners of each legal entity customer. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications.

The Office of Foreign Assets Control, (or “OFAC”), which is a division of the Treasury, is responsible for helping to ensure that United States entities do not engage in transactions with “enemies” of the United States, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC has sent, and will send, our banking regulatory agencies lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts. If the Bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze such account, file a suspicious activity report and notify OFAC. The Bank has appointed an OFAC compliance officer to oversee the inspection of its accounts and the filing of any notifications. The Bank actively checks high-risk OFAC areas such as new accounts, wire transfers and customer files. The Bank performs these checks utilizing software, which is updated each time a modification is made to the lists provided by OFAC and other agencies of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.
 
Privacy, Data Security and Credit Reporting. Financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information. Customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing nonpublic personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except under narrow circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer. Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers. It is the Bank’s policy not to disclose any personal information unless required by law.
 
Recent cyber-attacks against banks and other institutions that resulted in unauthorized access to confidential customer information have prompted the Federal banking agencies to issue several warnings and extensive guidance on cyber security. The agencies are likely to devote more resources to this part of their safety and soundness examination than they have in the past.
 
In addition, pursuant to the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (the “FACT Act”) and the implementing regulations of the federal banking agencies and Federal Trade Commission, the Bank is required to have in place an “identity theft red flags” program to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft. The Bank has implemented an identity theft red flags program designed to meet the requirements of the FACT Act and the joint final rules. Additionally, the FACT Act amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to generally prohibit a person from using information received from an affiliate to make a solicitation for marketing purposes to a consumer, unless the consumer is given notice and a reasonable opportunity and a reasonable and simple method to opt out of the making of such solicitations.
 
Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies. Our earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have major effects upon the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its open market operations in United States government securities and through its regulation of the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member bank deposits. It is not possible to predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies. The Federal Open Market Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points each on December 15, 2016, March 16, 2017, June 15, 2017 and December 14, 2017. During 2018, the rate was increased by 25 basis points on March 21, June 13, September 26 and December 19. The potential for further gradual increases in the federal funds rate depends on the economic outlook.
 
Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the insurance fund. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings institutions, after giving the bank’s regulatory authority an opportunity to take such action, and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition.
 
As an FDIC-insured bank, the Bank must pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC based on its average total assets minus its average tangible equity. The Bank’s assessment rates are currently based on its risk classification (i.e., the level of risk it poses to the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund). Institutions classified as higher risk pay assessments at higher rates than institutions that pose a lower risk. In addition, following the fourth consecutive quarter (and any applicable phase-in period) where an institution’s total consolidated assets equal or exceed $10 billion, the FDIC will use a performance score and a loss-severity score to calculate an initial assessment rate. In calculating these scores, the FDIC uses an institution’s capital level and regulatory supervisory ratings and certain financial measures to assess an institution’s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress. The FDIC also has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations. In addition to ordinary assessments described above, the FDIC has the ability to impose special assessments in certain instances.
 
The FDIC has raised assessment rates and imposed special assessments on certain institutions during recent years to raise funds. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the minimum designated reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund is 1.35% of the estimated total amount of insured deposits. In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the fund and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rulemaking if required.


In addition, FDIC insured institutions are required to pay a Financing Corporation assessment to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the 1980s. These assessments, which may be revised based upon the level of deposits, will continue until the bonds mature in the years 2017 through 2019. The amount assessed on individual institutions is in addition to the amount, if any, paid for deposit insurance according to the FDIC’s risk-related assessment rate schedules. Assessment rates may be adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment base.
  
20

The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance.
 
Incentive Compensation. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulators and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits that could lead to a material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The agencies proposed such regulations in April 2011, which reflected the guidance previously issued in June 2010 by the bank regulators. However, the 2011 proposal was replaced with a new proposal in May 2016, which makes explicit that the involvement of risk management and control personnel includes not only compliance, risk management and internal audit, but also legal, human resources, accounting, financial reporting and finance roles responsible for identifying, measuring, monitoring or controlling risk-taking. A final rule has not yet been adopted.
 
In June 2010, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors.
 
The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
 
Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate. Concentration risk exists when FDIC-insured institutions deploy too many assets to any one industry or segment. A concentration in commercial real estate is one example of regulatory concern. The interagency Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices guidance (“CRE Guidance”) provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to assist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate, and construction and land loans, represent 300% or more of an institution’s total risk-based capital and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more in the preceding three years or (ii) construction and land development loans exceed 100% of capital. The CRE Guidance does not limit banks’ levels of commercial real estate lending activities, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. On December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies issued a statement to reinforce prudent risk-management practices related to commercial real estate lending, having observed substantial growth in many commercial real estate asset and lending markets, increased competitive pressures, rising commercial real estate concentrations in banks, and an easing of commercial real estate underwriting standards. The federal bank agencies reminded FDIC-insured institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise prudent risk-management practices to identify, measure, monitor and manage the risks arising from commercial real estate lending. In addition, FDIC-insured institutions must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentration risk.
 
Based on the Bank’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018, the Bank did not exceed the 300% or the 100% guidelines for commercial real estate loans.
