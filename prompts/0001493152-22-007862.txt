Future Plans
 
As at the date of this report, the number of COVID-19 cases have hit over 447 million worldwide with approximately 6.0 million lives lost.
 
It has been approximately 2 years since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the lethargy brought about by the pandemic to the world populace, countries and governments is immense.
 
As of March 2022, Malaysia stands at position 26 as the country with the highest COVID-19 cases as recorded under the coronavirus statistics of the “worldometer”. Total COVID-19 cases in Malaysia hit approximately 3.6 million and associated fatality of 33, 228. These figures are huge relative to the small size economy of the country. We are witnessing the adverse impact on the purchasing power of consumers in Malaysia, where our products are mainly sold as a direct result of the prolonged pandemic. Revenue of ASL, our subsidiary that is principally involved in network marketing decreased significantly for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020.
 
Our immediate plans will be: (i) to bring the operational activities of ASL to pre-pandemic levels, to record higher revenue and profits. As businesses continues to be digitized, we will further capitalize on the e-commerce trading platform provided by Vettons Sdn. Bhd. to perform e-marketing and e-trading of our products to members, as well as online e-recruitment of new members; and (ii) to activate WATP whose principal activity is in promoting wellness and wellbeing lifestyle of the community by providing services that includes online editorials, programs, events and campaigns on how to achieve positive wellness and lifestyle. We will focus on developing customer centric programs, prioritizing high level engagements for a speedier and more tangible outcome.
 
On November 11, 2021, Agape ATP Corporation (Labuan) formed a joint-venture entity, DSY Wellness International Sdn. Bhd. (“DSY Wellness”) with an independent third party which Agape ATP Corporation (Labuan) owns 60% of the equity interest, to pursue the business of providing complementary health therapies. The establishment of DSY Wellness is a further expansion of our business into the health and wellness industry. The independent third party readily owns 33 proprietary formulas for treating non-communicable disease which he has agreed to bring into the company for joint commercialization. The independent third party also has existing clients receiving traditional complimentary medicine or “TCM” in Indonesia and Thailand. 
 
While the COVID-19 pandemic subsists, we will concentrate our resources in developing our businesses in Malaysia where most of our activities are concentrated. DSY Wellness will expand its businesses in the state of Penang and Johor in the short term. At time opportune, when the pandemic has subsided or is over and restrictions on travelling between nations are uplifted, service centers will be set up in Indonesia and Thailand. Together with ASL and WATP, this has the potential for the development of wellness tourism. As the products and services offerings of the Company widens beyond the sale of health products via network marketing, any overseas expansion could generate multiplier effect to the Company’s income and profitability, which the Company will capitalize. It is the Company’s ultimate aim to partake in all the lucrative areas of the health and wellness ecosystem as far as possible, to carve a niche in the health and wellness industry.

Marketing
 
Leveraging on information technology, we will continue to build our brand image to create brand awareness to penetrate the marketplace and attract customers. For the Company’s network marketing business, we have a corporate website which introduces and promotes our products and services, enable e-trading and e-recruitment of members. Going forward, we will use our corporate website more extensively to market all our products and services. We will utilize marketing related search engines to attract potential clients to our website. In financial year 2020, we have also synched-up with Vettons Sdn. Bhd, an e-merchant to further our reach through e-commerce. On February 1, 2021, Mr. How Kok Choong, the CEO and director of the Company, was appointed as the non-executive Chairman of Vettons Sdn Bhd. Vettons Sdn. Bhd became our related party since then.
 
Additionally, we will explore other online methods to enhance brand awareness that are impactful for community building for our other ventures in the health and wellness industry such as referral programs, develop contents for guest publishing, social media contests, etc. We will be social focus in the selection of social networks for our social media marketing, and where appropriate infographics will be used and influence marketing will be employed.
 
With the incorporation of DSY Wellness, much cross-selling and up-selling will be deployed for a more comprehensive products and services offerings to our customers. As discussed above, the multiplier effect of a wide products and services offerings to the Company’s revenue stream and bottom line is huge.
 
Competition
 
The health and wellness industry, with a focus on health supplements in particular in Malaysia, where we operate, is rather competitive. Our focus is on the mature group of customers, i.e. adults ranging in age from 18-65 years old. We face competition from various retail health supplement providers, pharmacies, and Multi-Level Marketing Companies which supply health supplement products, such as Bio-Life Marketing Sdn Bhd, Elken Group, Usana Group, BMS Organics, NHF Group and their respective affiliates. These competitors are generating significant traffic to their marketing websites; and have established brand recognition and financial resources.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our type of market include the quality of health supplements, the efficacies of the health supplements, strength and depth of relationships with clients, the ability to identify the changing needs and requirements of prospective clients, and the scope of services. Through utilizing our competitive strengths, we believe that we have a competitive edge over other competitors due to the breadth of our product offerings, one stop convenience, pricing, our services, our reputation and product safety. As discussed, the prolonged pandemic has eroded much of the purchasing power of the Malaysian community. The last year has seen consumers shifting to more affordable goods and services. As nations start to accept COVID-19 as endemic, we will target our resources to regain our operational activities to pre-pandemic level. Next, we will develop and enlarge our market share in the Malaysian market and potentially further into the overseas market.
 
The Company’s latest investment in TCM is comparatively a less competitive health and wellness segment, especially at a time when non-communicable disease is on the rise. The independent third party whom we joint venture with is an accredited practitioner in TCM in Malaysia.
 
Customers
 
Our customer base from our network marketing sales channel stood at 128,235 members as at December 31, 2021. We will rework our product-mix and pricing to help our distributors and members to strengthen and widen their sales network. We will also capitalize the existing customer base to build the wellness and wellbeing lifestyle community to enhance WATP’s business, and for our TCM products and services offerings.
