Item 1—Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983, in Seattle, Washington. We are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.), Mexico, Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, France, Iceland, and through a majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan. Costco operated 762, 741, and 715 warehouses worldwide at September 2, 2018, September 3, 2017, and August 28, 2016, respectively. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol “COST.”
We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2018 and 2016 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended September 2, 2018, and August 28, 2016, respectively. References to 2017 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2017.
General
We operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts. 
We buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses. This process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies, lowering costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels.
Our average warehouse space is approximately 145,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and

low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations.
Our warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit, including the Costco co-branded card, and debit cards, cash, and checks. 
Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry an average of approximately 3,700 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.
In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items.
We offer merchandise in the following categories:

• | Food and Sundries (including dry foods, packaged foods, groceries, snack foods, candy, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, and cleaning supplies)


• | Hardlines (including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, and garden and patio)


• | Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, deli, and bakery)


• | Softlines (including apparel and small appliances)


• | Ancillary (including gasoline and pharmacy businesses)

Ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services, encouraging members to shop more frequently. These businesses include gas stations, pharmacies, optical dispensing centers, food courts, and hearing-aid centers. The number of warehouses with gas stations vary significantly by country, and we do not operate our gasoline business in Korea or France. We operated 567 gas stations at the end of 2018. 
Our e-commerce operations allow us to connect with our members online and provide additional products and services, many not found in our warehouses. We operate e-commerce websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, and Taiwan. Net sales for e-commerce represented approximately 4% of total net sales in 2018. Additionally, we offer business delivery, travel and various other services online in certain countries.
We have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. We generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise and believe that if current sources of supply became unavailable, we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business. We also purchase and manufacture private-label merchandise, as long as quality and member demand are comparable and the value to our members is significant.
Certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

Membership 
Our members may utilize their memberships at our warehouses worldwide. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals; Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or comparable evidence. Business members have the ability to add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star members. Our annual fee for these memberships is $60 in our U.S. and Canadian operations and varies in other countries. All paid memberships include a free household card. 
Our member renewal rate was 90% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% on a worldwide basis at the end of 2018. The majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date. Therefore, our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. 
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

 | 2018 | 2017 | | 2016
Gold Star | 40,700 | | 38,600 | | 36,800
Business, including affiliates | 10,900 | | 10,800 | | 10,800
Total paid members | 51,600 | | 49,400 | | 47,600
Household cards | 42,700 | | 40,900 | | 39,100
Total cardholders | 94,300 | | 90,300 | | 86,700

Paid cardholders (except Business affiliates) are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S. and Canada for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive memberships are also available in Mexico and the U.K., for which the additional annual fee varies. Executive members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year in U.S. and Canada and varies in Mexico and the U.K.), and can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. This program also offers (except in Mexico), access to additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services, such as auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program, and check printing services. These services are generally provided by third parties and vary by state and country. Executive members, who represented 37% of paid members at the end of 2018, generally shop more frequently and spend more than other members.
Labor
Our employee count was as follows:

 | 2018 | 2017 | | 2016
Full-time employees | 143,000 | | 133,000 | | 126,000
Part-time employees | 102,000 | | 98,000 | | 92,000 
Total employees | 245,000 | | 231,000 | | 218,000

Approximately 15,900 employees are union employees. We consider our employee relations to be very good.
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location, convenience, distribution strategy, and customer service. We compete on a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores, and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Walmart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon.com are among our significant general

merchandise retail competitors. We also compete with warehouse club operations (primarily Walmart’s Sam’s Club and BJ’s Wholesale Club), and nearly every major U.S. and Mexico metropolitan area has multiple club operations.
Intellectual Property
We believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, patents, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale® trademarks and our private-label brand, Kirkland Signature®. We believe that Kirkland Signature products are high quality, offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than national brands, and that they help lower costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private label items.
We rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are properly maintained.
