ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------


Neogen Corporation and subsidiaries develop, manufacture and market a diverse line of products and services dedicated to food and animal safety. Our Food Safety segment consists primarily of diagnostic test kits and complementary products (e.g., culture media) sold to food producers and processors to detect dangerous and/or unintended substances in human food and animal feed, such as foodborne pathogens, spoilage organisms, natural toxins, food allergens, genetic modifications, ruminant by-products, meat speciation, drug residues, pesticide residues and general sanitation concerns. Our diagnostic test kits are generally easier to use and provide greater accuracy and speed than conventional diagnostic methods. The majority of the test kits are disposable, single-use, immunoassay and DNA detection products that rely on proprietary antibodies and RNA and DNA testing methodologies to produce rapid and accurate test results. Our expanding line of food safety products also includes genomics-based diagnostic technology, and advanced software systems that help testers to objectively analyze and store their results and perform analysis on the results from multiple locations over extended periods. 
 On December 13, 2021, Neogen and 3M announced plans to merge 3M’s Food Safety business with Neogen in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the third calendar quarter of 2022. See Note 3, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 
 Neogen’s Animal Safety segment is engaged in the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of veterinary instruments, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, topicals, parasiticides, diagnostic products, rodenticides, cleaners, disinfectants, insecticides and genomics testing services for the worldwide animal safety market. The majority of these consumable products are marketed through veterinarians, retailers, livestock producers and animal health product distributors. Our line of drug detection products is sold worldwide for the detection of abused and therapeutic drugs in animals and animal products, and has expanded into the workplace and human forensic markets. 
 Neogen’s products are marketed by our sales personnel in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Central America, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China, India and Australia, and by distributors throughout the rest of the world.

Neogen operates in two business areas: the Food Safety and the Animal Safety segments. See the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” section of this Form 10-K for financial information about our business segments and international operations. 
 FOOD SAFETY SEGMENT 
 Neogen’s Food Safety segment is primarily engaged in the production and marketing of diagnostic test kits and complementary products marketed to food and feed producers and processors to detect dangerous and/or unintended substances in food and animal feed, such as foodborne pathogens, spoilage organisms, natural toxins, food allergens, genetic modifications, ruminant by-products, meat speciation, drug residues, pesticide residues and general sanitation concerns. Our test kits are used to detect potential hazards or unintended substances in food and animal feed by testers ranging from small local grain elevators to the largest, best-known food and feed processors in the world, and numerous regulatory agencies. Neogen’s products include tests for: 
 Mycotoxins. Grain producers and processors of all types and sizes use our Veratox, Agri-Screen, Reveal, Reveal Q+ and Reveal Q+ MAX tests to detect the presence of mycotoxins, including aflatoxin, aflatoxin M1, deoxynivalenol, fumonisin, ochratoxin, zearalenone, T-2/HT-2 toxin and ergot alkaloid, to help ensure product safety and quality in food and animal feed. 
 Food allergens. The world’s largest producers of cookies, crackers, candy, ice cream and many other processed foods use our Veratox, Alert, Reveal, Reveal 3-D and BioKits testing products to help protect their food-allergic customers from the inadvertent contamination of products with food allergens, including but not limited to peanut, milk, egg, almond, gliadin (gluten), soy, hazelnut and coconut residues. 
 Dairy antibiotics. Dairy processors are the primary users of Neogen’s BetaStar diagnostic tests to detect the presence of veterinary antibiotics in milk. The presence of these drugs above a certain level in milk is a public health hazard and an economic risk to producers as it limits the milk’s further processing. 
 Foodborne pathogens. Meat and poultry processors, seafood processors, fruit and vegetable producers and many other market segments are the primary users of Neogen’s ANSR and Reveal tests for foodborne bacteria, including E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Listeria and Campylobacter. Neogen’s ANSR pathogen detection system is an isothermal amplification reaction test method that exponentially amplifies the DNA of any bacteria present in food and environmental samples to detectable levels in 10 minutes. Combined with ANSR’s single enrichment step, Neogen’s pathogen detection method provides DNA-definitive results in a fraction of the time of other molecular detection methods. Our Listeria Right Now test detects the pathogen in less than 60 minutes without sample enrichment. Reveal’s lateral flow device combines an immunoassay with chromatography for a rapid and accurate one-step result. 
 Spoilage microorganisms. Neogen’s Soleris products are used by food processors to identify the presence of spoilage organisms (e.g., yeast and mold) and other microbiological contamination in food. The systems measure microbial growth by monitoring biochemical reactions that generate a color change in the media as microorganisms grow. The sensitivity of the system allows detection in a fraction of the time needed for traditional methods, with less labor and handling time. In July 2020, we launched Soleris NG, a next generation version of the platform, which features enhanced hardware and software for results that are easier to analyze and audit. Our NeoSeek genomics services utilize a novel application of metagenomics to determine all bacteria in a sample, without introducing biases from culture media, and without the need to generate a bacterial isolate for each possible microbe in a sample. 
 Sanitation monitoring. Neogen manufactures and markets our AccuPoint Advanced rapid sanitation test to detect the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a chemical found in all living cells. This easy-to-use and inexpensive test uses bioluminescence to quickly determine if a contact surface has been completely sanitized. When ATP comes into contact with reagents contained in the test device, a reaction takes place that produces light. More light is indicative of higher levels of ATP and a need for more thorough sanitation. In May 2021, we launched AccuPoint Advanced NG, a next generation version, designed to be simpler to use, and provide results that are easier to analyze. Our worldwide customer base for ATP sanitation testing products includes food and beverage processors, the food service and healthcare industries, as well as many other users. 
 Seafood contaminants. Neogen’s specialty products for the seafood market include tests for histamine, a highly allergenic substance that occurs when certain species of fish begin to decay; sulfite, an effective but potentially allergenic shrimp preservative; and shellfish toxins. Neogen’s Reveal lateral

  flow tests for shellfish toxins include rapid tests to detect the toxins that cause amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP), diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) and paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). 
 Waterborne microorganisms. Neogen offers the food and beverage industries, including water companies, several platforms for performing the microbial analysis of water. This includes Neogen’s filter tests, which are a combination of Neogen Filter membrane filtration and Neogen Culture Media ampouled media, and an easy-to-use Colitag product. With Colitag, after an incubation period, the sample changes color in the presence of coliforms and fluoresces in the presence of E. coli. 
 Culture media. Neogen Culture Media, formerly Neogen’s Acumedia and Lab M products, offers culture media and prepared media for varied purposes, including traditional bacterial testing and the growth of beneficial bacteria, such as cultures for sausages and beer. Our customers for culture media also include commercial and research laboratories and producers of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and veterinary vaccines. 
 Food quality diagnostics. Through the December 2020 acquisition of Ireland-based Megazyme, Ltd., Neogen supplies diagnostic kits and specialty enzymes used worldwide by quality control laboratories in the food, animal feed and beverage industries. Megazyme’s validated assays and reagents are used across various food industries such as the grain, wine and dairy markets, to measure dietary fibers, complex carbohydrates, simple sugars and organic acids, such as lactose.
 Digital services. Our food safety and risk management software-as-a-service, Neogen Analytics, delivers a comprehensive Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) automation solution for food companies. The software reduces risk by increasing visibility to food safety testing results, elevating the ability to enforce and improve food safety standards. Neogen Analytics builds upon innovative technologies like our AccuPoint Advanced Next Generation and ANSR systems, offering floor plan mapping, smart test scheduling, easily filtered and auditable data management, and corrective actions. 
 Laboratory services. Neogen offers food safety analysis services in the U.S., United Kingdom (U.K.) and India. These ISO-accredited laboratories offer a variety of fee-for-service tests for the food and feed industries. 
 The majority of Neogen’s food safety test kits use immunoassay technology to rapidly detect target substances. Our ability to produce high quality antibodies sets our products apart from immunoassay test kits produced and sold by other companies. Our kits are available in microwell formats, which allow for automated and rapid processing of a large number of samples, and lateral flow and other similar devices that provide distinct visual results. Typically, test kits use antibody-coated test devices and chemical reagents to indicate a positive or negative result for the presence of a target substance in a test sample; the simplicity of the tests makes them accessible to all levels of food producers, processors and handlers. Neogen also offers other testing methods and products to complement its immunoassay tests. 
 Our test kits are generally based on internally developed technology, licensed technology, or technology that is acquired as a result of acquisitions. In fiscal 2022, the Food Safety segment incurred expense totaling $1,779,000 for royalties for licensed technology used in our products, including expense of $800,000 for allergen products and $494,000 for the pathogen product line. Generally, royalty rates are in the range of 2% to 10% of revenues on products containing the licensed technology. Some licenses involve technology that is exclusive to Neogen’s use, while others are non-exclusive and involve technology licensed to multiple licensees. 
 Neogen’s international operations in the U.K., Mexico, Guatemala, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, China and India originally focused on food safety products, and each of these units reports through the Food Safety segment. In recent years, these operations have expanded to offer our complete line of products and services, including those usually associated with the Animal Safety segment such as cleaners, disinfectants, rodenticides, insecticides, veterinary instruments and genomics services. These additional products and services are managed and directed by existing management at our international operations, and report through the Food Safety segment. 
 Revenues from Neogen’s Food Safety segment accounted for 49.3%, 50.0%, and 50.9% of our total revenues for fiscal years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 ANIMAL SAFETY SEGMENT

Other products sold under the NeogenVet brand include Vita-15 and Liver 7, which are used in the treatment and prevention of nutritional deficiencies. Neogen also markets Uniprim, a veterinary antibiotic, and, through the Company’s September 2021 acquisition of CAPInnoVet, Inc., several companion animal parasiticides. 
 Veterinary biologics. Neogen’s BotVax B vaccine has successfully protected thousands of horses and foals against Type B botulism, commonly known as Shaker Foal Syndrome. Our product is the only USDA-approved vaccine for the prevention of Type B botulism in horses. Years of research and many thousands of doses have proven Neogen’s EqStim immunostimulant to be safe and effective as a veterinarian-administered adjunct to conventional treatment of equine bacterial and viral respiratory infections. The Company’s ImmunoRegulin product uses similar immunostimulant technology to aid in the treatment of pyoderma (a bacterial skin inflammation) in dogs. 
 Veterinary OTC products. Animal Safety products offered by Neogen to the retail over-the-counter (OTC) market include Ideal brand veterinary instruments packaged for the retail market. OTC products also include Stress-Dex, an oral electrolyte replacer for performance horses, and Fura-Zone, for the prevention and treatment of surface bacterial infections in wounds, burns and cutaneous ulcers. Hoof care, disposables and artificial insemination supplies are marketed to the dairy and veterinary industries. 
 Rodenticides. Neogen’s comprehensive line of proven rodenticides, sold under brand names such as Ramik and Havoc, effectively address rodent problems of any size and serve as a critical component of an overall biosecurity plan for animal protein production operations. Neogen offers several rodenticide active ingredients including diphacinone, bromethalin, brodifacoum and zinc phosphide, formulated with food grade ingredients to generate the highest acceptance and most palatable bait possible. 
 Cleaners and disinfectants. Used in animal and food production facilities, Neogen’s cleaners and disinfectants, including 904 Disinfectant, Acid-A-Foam, Synergize, BioPhene, Neogen Viroxide Super, and Companion, prevent disease outbreaks. The products are also used in the veterinary clinic market to maintain sanitary conditions and limit the potential hazards of bacteria, fungi and viruses. Neogen’s water line cleaner and disinfectant products, including Peraside, NeoKlor, AquaPrime and Siloxycide, are used to clean water lines and provide continuous disinfection of a livestock facility’s water supply. 
 Insecticides. Neogen’s highly effective insecticides utilize environmentally friendly technical formulas, and several are approved for use in food establishments and by pest control professionals in a wide range of environments. The Company’s Prozap insecticide brand is used in the large animal production industry, particularly with dairy and equine producers. Neogen’s SureKill line of products is used by professionals to control a variety of insects and the Company’s StandGuard Pour-on solution, acquired in July 2020, is used for horn fly and lice control in beef cattle. 
 Animal genomics services. Neogen Genomics, formerly known as GeneSeek, provides value-added services to leading agricultural genetics providers, large national cattle associations, companion animal breed registries and direct to consumer canine genetic test providers, university researchers, and numerous commercial beef and dairy cattle, swine, sheep and poultry producers. With state-of-the-art genomics laboratories and the comprehensive bioinformatics to interpret genomics test results, Neogen Genomics offers identity and trait determination and analysis. Our technology employs high-density DNA genotyping and genomic sequencing for identity and trait analysis in a variety of important animal and agricultural plant species. Our extensive bioinformatics database identifies and predicts an animal’s positive or negative traits based on DNA test results. This information has helped livestock producers increase the speed of genetic improvement in their herds and overall performance and quality of their animals. Neogen’s December 2021 acquisition of Genetic Veterinary Sciences, Inc. expanded the Company’s portfolio through the addition of a number of genetic tests for companion animals, including dogs, cats and birds. 
 Life sciences. Neogen’s line of approximately 100 drug detection immunoassay test kits is sold worldwide for the detection of approximately 300 abused and therapeutic drugs in farm animals and racing animals, and for the detection of drug residues in meat and meat products. The test kits are also used for human forensic toxicology drug screening applications. This line includes tests for narcotics, analgesics, stimulants, depressants, tranquilizers, anesthetics, steroids and diuretics. Neogen also has several products used by researchers for the detection of biologically active substances.

Management expects that a number of these products will be commercially available at various times during fiscal years 2023 and 2024. 
 Certain technologies used in some products manufactured and marketed by Neogen were acquired from or developed in collaboration with affiliated partners, independent scientists, governmental agencies, universities and other third parties. We have entered into agreements with these parties that provide for the payment of royalties based upon sales of products that use the pertinent licensed technology. Royalties, expensed to sales and marketing, under these agreements amounted to $1,999,000, $2,129,000, and $2,524,000 in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

  PROPRIETARY PROTECTION AND APPROVALS 
 Neogen uses trade secrets as proprietary protection in many of its food and animal safety products. In many cases, we have developed unique antibodies capable of detecting microorganisms and residues at minute levels. The supply of these antibodies, and the proprietary techniques utilized for their development, may offer better protection than filing patents. Such proprietary reagents are maintained in secure facilities and stored in more than one location to reduce exposure to complete destruction by natural disaster or other means. 
 Patent and trademark applications are submitted whenever appropriate. Since its inception, Neogen has acquired and been granted numerous patents and trademarks and has numerous pending patents and trademark applications. The patents expire at various times over the next 20 years. 
 A summary of patents by product categories follows: 
 

 | USA | | International | | Expiration
Natural Toxins, Allergens, & Drug Residues | | 18 | | 57 | | 2023-2042
Life Sciences | | 0 | | 3 | | 2024 
Vaccine | | 1 | | 0 | | 2028 
Veterinary Instruments & Other | | 10 | | 28 | | 2023-2042
Genomics Services | | 18 | | 3 | | 2024-2029


We do not expect the near-term expiration of any single patent to have a significant effect on future results of operations. 
 Management believes that Neogen has adequate rights to commercialize our products. However, we are aware that substantial research is conducted at universities, governmental agencies and other companies throughout the world and that it is always possible that patents have been applied for and could be granted that are relevant to technologies that may be used in our products. To the extent some of our products may now, or in the future, embody technologies protected by patents or trade secrets of others, we may need to obtain licenses to use such technologies to continue to sell the products. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Failure to obtain any such licenses could delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products. In addition, patent litigation is not uncommon. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will continue to have adequate rights to commercialize our new products or that we will avoid litigation. 
 One of the major areas affecting the success of biotechnology development involves the time, cost and uncertainty surrounding regulatory approvals. Neogen products requiring regulatory approval, which we currently have in place, include BotVax B, EqStim, ImmunoRegulin, Uniprim and BetaStar. Our general strategy is to focus on technical and proprietary products that do not require mandatory approval by regulatory bodies to be marketed. Neogen’s rodenticide, disinfectant and insecticide products are subject to registration in the United States and internationally. 
 Neogen utilizes third-party validations on many of our disposable test kits to provide our customers with assurances that our products perform to specified levels. These include validation by the AOAC International, independently administered third-party, multi-laboratory collaborative studies and approvals by the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service for the use of our products in their operations. 
 PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY 
 Neogen manufactures our products in Michigan, Kentucky, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Iowa, Tennessee, California, Ireland, the United Kingdom and Brazil and provides genomics services in Nebraska, Washington, Scotland, Brazil, Australia, China and Canada. As of May 31, 2022, there were approximately 1,039 full-time employees assigned to manufacturing operations and providing of services in these locations, operating on multiple shift schedules; with occasional 24/7 production during high demand periods. Future demand increases could be accommodated by adding shifts. Management believes we could increase the current output of our primary product lines by more than 30% using the current space available; however, to do so would require investment in additional equipment. 
 Food safety diagnostics. Manufacturing of diagnostic tests for the detection of natural toxins, pathogens, food allergens, dairy antibiotics, spoilage organisms and pesticides, final kit assembly, quality assurance and shipping takes place at our facilities in Lansing, Michigan. Proprietary monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies for Neogen’s diagnostic kits are produced on a regular schedule in our immunology laboratories in Lansing. Generally, final assembly and shipment of diagnostic test kits to customers in Europe is performed in our Ayr, Scotland facility. Most of the Company’s food safety

  diagnostic instruments and readers are produced by third-party vendors to our specifications, quality tested in Lansing, and then shipped to customers. Culture media products are manufactured in an ISO-approved facility in Lansing and in Heywood and Liverpool, England. Products are blended following strict formulations or custom blended to customer specifications and shipped directly to customers from Lansing and the United Kingdom. The Heywood location produces prepared media plates, sterile liquid media, and other related products in ready to use format for food testing laboratories across the U.K. and western Europe. Enzyme substrates are manufactured at Megazyme in Bray, Ireland. 
 Animal health products. Manufacturing of animal health products, pharmacological diagnostic test kits and test kits for drug residues takes place in our FDA-registered facilities in Lexington, Kentucky. In general, manufacturing operations including reagent manufacturing, quality assurance, final kit assembly and packaging are performed by Neogen personnel. Certain animal health products and veterinary instruments that are purchased finished or that are toll manufactured by third party vendors are warehoused and shipped from our Lexington facilities. Some veterinary instruments are produced in our facilities in Lansing, and are generally then shipped to Lexington for distribution to customers. Manufacturing and shipment of devices used for animal injections, topical applications and oral administration occurs in Kenansville, North Carolina. 
 Veterinary biologics. Neogen maintains a Lansing-based USDA-approved manufacturing facility devoted to the production of the biologic products EqStim and ImmunoRegulin. P.acnes seed cultures are added to media and then subjected to several stages of further processing resulting in a finished product that is filled and packaged within the facility. Our BotVax B vaccine is also produced in the Lansing facility utilizing Type B botulism seed cultures and a traditional fermentation process. All completed biologic products are then shipped to Neogen’s Lexington facilities where they are inventoried prior to distribution to customers. 
 Agricultural genomics services. Neogen offers agricultural genomics laboratory services and bioinformatics at our locations in Nebraska, Washington, Scotland, Brazil, Australia, China and Canada. Through our laboratory services and bioinformatics (primarily in beef and dairy cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry, horses and dogs), Neogen Genomics allows our customers to speed genetic improvement efforts, as well as identify economically important diseases. 
 Cleaners, disinfectants and rodenticides. Manufacturing of rodenticides and/or cleaners and disinfectants takes place in the following locations: Wisconsin, Tennessee, California, England and Brazil. Manufacturing of rodenticides consists of blending technical material (active ingredient) with bait consisting principally of various grains. Certain cleaners and disinfectants are manufactured in Neogen facilities, while others are purchased from other manufacturers for resale, or toll manufactured by third parties. 
 Insecticides. Neogen manufactures insecticides and other pesticides at its facilities in Iowa and Brazil. 
 Neogen purchases component parts and raw materials from more than 1,000 suppliers. Though many of these items are purchased from a single source to achieve the greatest volume discounts, we believe we have identified acceptable alternative suppliers for most of our key components and raw materials where it is economically feasible to do so. There can be no assurance that we would avoid a disruption of supply in the event a supplier discontinues shipment of product. Shipments of higher volume products are generally accomplished within a 48-hour turnaround time. Our backlog of unshipped orders at any given time has historically not been significant. 
 COMPETITION 
 Although competitors vary in individual markets, management knows of no single competitor that is pursuing Neogen’s fundamental strategy of developing and marketing a broad line of products, ranging from disposable tests and culture media to veterinary pharmaceuticals and instruments for a large number of food safety and animal safety concerns. For each of our individual products or product lines, we face intense competition from companies ranging from small businesses to divisions of large multinational companies. Some of these organizations have substantially greater financial resources than Neogen. We compete primarily on the basis of ease of use, speed, accuracy and other similar performance characteristics of our products. The breadth of our product line, the effectiveness of our sales and customer service organizations, and pricing are also components in management’s competitive strategy. 
 Future competition may become even more intense, and could result from the development of new technologies, which could affect the marketability and profitability of Neogen’s products. Our competitive position will also depend on our ability to continue to develop proprietary products, attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop and implement production and marketing plans and obtain patent protection for new products. Additionally, we must continue to generate or have access to adequate capital resources to execute our strategy.

  FOOD SAFETY: 
 With a large professional sales organization offering a comprehensive catalog of food safety solutions, management believes we maintain a general advantage over competitors offering only limited product lines. In most cases, Neogen sales and technical service personnel can offer unique insight into a customer’s numerous safety and quality challenges, and offer testing and other solutions to help the customer overcome those challenges. 
 Competition for pathogen detection products includes traditional methods and antibody and genetic-based platforms; competition for natural toxins and allergen detection products include instrumentation and antibody-based tests. While our offerings will not always compete on all platforms in all markets, the products we offer provide tests that can be utilized by most customers to meet their testing needs. 
 In addition to our extensive product offerings and robust distribution network, we focus our competitive advantage in the areas of customer service, product performance, speed, and ease of use of our products. Additionally, by aggressively maintaining Neogen’s ability to produce at low cost, we believe that we can be competitive with new market entrants that may choose a low pricing strategy in an attempt to gain market share. 
 ANIMAL SAFETY: 
 Neogen’s Animal Safety segment faces no single competitor across the products and markets we serve. In the racing industry market, we believe we hold a leading market share position. In the life sciences and forensics markets, we compete against several other diagnostic and reagent companies with similar product offerings. 
 In the veterinary market, Neogen markets BotVax B, the only USDA-approved vaccine for the prevention of botulism Type B in horses. We compete on other key products through differentiated product performance and superior customer and technical support. With some of our products, we provide solutions as a lower cost alternative and also offer a private label option for our distributors. 
 Competition in the rodenticide market includes several companies of comparable size that offer products into similar market segments. The retail rodenticide market is not dominated by a single brand. While the technical materials used by competing companies are similar, Neogen uses manufacturing and bait formula techniques which we believe may better attract rodents to the product and thereby improves overall product performance. 
 Within the insecticide market, Chem-Tech products specifically focus on the area of insect control for food and animal safety applications. There are several competitors offering similar products, however, we have a proprietary formulation chemistry that optimizes the delivery and safe application of insecticides at the customer’s location. These products are currently only sold in the U.S. through a combination of direct sales and distributors. 
 Numerous companies, including a number of large multinationals, compete for sales in the cleaner and disinfectant product segment. Neogen’s broad line of products are sold through our distributor network around the world, primarily to assist in the cleaning and disinfecting of animal production facilities. 
 In addition to our extensive portfolio of animal safety products, Neogen also competes in the retail market by providing solutions to common retail problems, such as stock outs, wasted floor space and inconsistent brand identity. We differentiate ourselves by offering planograms and convenient reordering systems to maximize turns and profitability for our retail customers. 
 Neogen Genomics, the leading worldwide commercial agricultural genomics laboratory in the U.S., employs cutting-edge technology in the area of genomics. The result of this technology allows the acceleration of natural selection through parentage testing and selective breeding of traits such as disease resistance, yield improvement and meat quality. Competition comes mainly from a number of service providers, some significantly larger than us as well as several smaller companies offering genomics services. Neogen Genomics is not involved in cloning or the development of transgenic animals. 
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 A significant portion of Neogen’s products and revenues are affected by the regulations of various domestic and foreign government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Changes in these regulations could affect revenues and/or costs of production and distribution. 
 
12 

  Neogen’s development and manufacturing processes involve the use of certain hazardous materials, chemicals and compounds. Management believes that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such commodities comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state and local regulations; however, changes in such regulations or rules could involve significant costs to us and could be materially adverse to our business. 
 The rodenticides, insecticides, cleaners, disinfectants and sanitizers manufactured and distributed by Neogen are subject to EPA and various state regulations. In general, any international sale of our products must also comply with similar regulatory requirements in the country of destination. Each country has its own individual regulatory construct with specific requirements (e.g., label in the language of the importing country). To the best of our knowledge, Neogen products are compliant with applicable regulations in the countries where such products are sold. 
 Many of the food safety diagnostic products do not require direct government approval. However, we have pursued AOAC approval for a number of these products to enhance their marketability. Our BetaStar Advanced U.S. dairy antibiotic residue testing product has been reviewed and/or approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies. 
 Neogen’s veterinary vaccine products and some pharmaceutical products require government approval to allow for lawful sales. The vaccine products are approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Center for Veterinary Biologics (USDA-CVB) and the pharmaceutical products are approved by the FDA. The products, and the facilities in which they are manufactured, are in a position of good standing with both agencies. We have no warning letters based on any review of these products or facility inspections, no recalls on any of these products, and are not aware of any reason why we could not manufacture and market such products in the future. 
 Other animal safety and food safety products generally do not require additional registrations or approvals. However, Neogen’s regulatory staff routinely monitors amendments to current regulatory requirements to ensure compliance.
