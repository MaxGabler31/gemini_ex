Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a provider of purpose-built zero-emission electric vehicles focused on reducing the total cost of vehicle ownership and helping fleet operators unlock the benefits of green technology. We serve commercial and last-mile fleets, school districts, public and private transportation service companies and colleges and universities to meet the increasing demand for light to heavy-duty electric vehicles. Our vehicles address the challenges of traditional fuel price cost instability and local, state and federal environmental regulatory compliance. 
 Our vehicles are manufactured by outside, OEM partners located in China and Malaysia that can be marketed, sold, warrantied and serviced through our developing distribution and service network. 
 Our vehicles can include options for telemetrics for remote monitoring, electric power-export and various levels of grid-connectivity. Pending the completion of the transactions contemplated by our letter of intent to purchase certain battery manufacturing equipment from ProGreens New Energy Technology Co. Ltd., our zero-emission products may also grow to include automated charging infrastructure and “intelligent” stationary energy storage that enables fast vehicle charging, emergency back-up facility power, and access to the developing, grid-connected opportunities for the aggregate power available from groups of large battery packs. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our net losses were $7,652,100 and $279,521, respectively. On March 15, 2021, we completed our acquisition of EVTDS, a Delaware corporation, a supplier of zero-emission trucks, cargo vans, chassis and other commercial vehicles from which we have previously purchased vehicles designed to meet our specifications. The transaction was completed in accordance with the Merger Agreement, with EVTDS and EVT Acquisition Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”). As a result of such transaction, Merger Sub was merged with and into EVTDS, with EVTDS surviving as our wholly owned subsidiary (the “Merger”). In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of the common stock of EVTDS was automatically converted into the right to receive one share of the common stock of the Company. As a result of the Merger, we issued an aggregate of 142,558,001 shares of our common stock to the former EVTDS stockholders, which shares represented approximately 56% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our common stock as of immediately following the effective time of the Merger. 
 Our company was formerly known as ADOMANI, Inc. On May 26, 2021, we filed a Certificate of Amendment of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to change our company’s name from ADOMANI, Inc. to Envirotech Vehicles, Inc., effective as of May 26. 
 Market Overview 
 Concerns regarding climate change and other environmental considerations have led to the implementation of laws and regulations that restrict, cap, or tax, emissions in the automotive industry and throughout other industries. In particular, Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, Tier 4 emission standards, CARB regulations, and recently implemented policies in Europe, generally referred to as Stage I, II, III, IV, V and VI regulations, require a significant reduction in the level of emissions and particulate matter produced by diesel power systems and are increasing the costs associated with producing carbon-intensive fuels. On June 28, 2018, China officially released the China VI emission standard for new heavy-duty vehicles, which is equivalent to, or in some respects even more stringent than, the Euro VI emission standard. The China VI standard intends to force diesel particulate filters on all new diesel heavy-duty vehicles introduced to the market after July 2021. If effectively implemented, it will transition all new heavy-duty vehicles in China to soot-free emission levels. In February 2018, the Mexican government announced a new policy that focused on reducing air pollution,

  improving public health and ultimately saving lives. This policy included the first soot-free standard adopted in Latin America, which required that all heavy-duty vehicles sold in Mexico meet the highest filter-based standards that are currently in place in other countries like the United States, Canada and much of the European Union. On June 25, 2020, the Board of CARB passed a first-in-the-world rule requiring truck manufacturers to transition from diesel trucks and cargo vans to electric zero-emission vehicles beginning in 2024. More recently, in December 2021, President Biden signed an executive order directing the federal government to minimize planet- heating emissions from operations and transition to an all-electric fleet of cars and trucks, with the stated goal of reducing its emissions by 65% by 2030 and reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. 
 These regulations are expected to increase both the cost and size of emission-compliant diesel power products, primarily due to the need to incorporate additional combustion and after-treatment components. A variety of market factors are contributing to the increased use of alternative fuels and growth of alternative fuel technology, including economics, energy independence, environmental concerns, and the widespread availability of alternative fuels. As the price of crude oil remains volatile and the threats of climate change and air pollution increase as public concerns, we believe the search for more cost effective and cleaner fuels has become more important. Electricity has emerged as a cleaner-fuel solution to these challenges. The price of alternative fuels such as electricity is often substantially less than diesel or gasoline, and alternative fuels can result in the production of lower amounts of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants. In addition, several public utilities in California and elsewhere have applied to their states’ PUCs for rate increases to be used for the purchase or leasing of electric vehicles and infrastructure. Additional requests have been made by the utilities to offer favorable costs for electric bus charging. In fact, the Invest in America Act being debated in Congress would allocate $1.75 billion to various government entities to support electric and other alternative-type chargers. 
 According to the IEA, the world’s fleet of electric vehicles grew 41% to about 7.2 million in 2019, and the IEA forecasts electric vehicles will grow from 7 million to 140 million by 2030, with government policy being the linchpin for electric vehicle adoption. 
 Based on the IEA’s view, we believe that existing policies will make China and Europe the biggest adopters. In China, the government has mandated that electric vehicles make up 40% of all auto sales by 2030. Meanwhile, we believe that tightening emissions standards and high fuel taxes in Europe will result in substantial increases in the market share of electric vehicles. New electric car sales in China grew by 47%, or by approximately 830,000 units, in 2019, which increased total ownership to over 2.5 million vehicles. 
 In the United States, 310,000 new electric vehicles were sold in the first half of 2021. In full year of 2020, approximately 322,000 were sold. 
 The overall market for electric vehicles consists of multiple, discrete markets for various vehicle types, including passenger cars, buses, two-wheelers and others. Passenger cars are the most prominent, but two-wheelers are far more prevalent, particularly in Asia, and buses and trucks, although smaller in number, are significantly higher in price and often purchased in bulk by major corporate customers or government or transit agencies. Because light duty passenger vehicles represent the largest potential market and have received the most attention from both analysts and policymakers, most global forecasts look at light duty electric vehicle sales. 
 Charging infrastructure is another important factor in electric vehicle adoption rates. As of December 2021, there were approximately 46,000 charging stations in the United States. GuideHouse Insights is projecting 25% CAGR globally in the number of charging stations now through 2030 and Bloomberg NEF projects that the need for charging stations will top 290 million by 2040, with a value of $500 billion worldwide. President Biden’s American Jobs Plan includes a transformational $15 billion investment to build a national network of 500,000 charging stations. Through a combination of grant and incentive programs for state and local governments and the private sector, it will support deployment of a mix of chargers in apartment buildings, in public parking, throughout communities, and as a robust fast charging along our nation’s roadways. Some geographic areas have considerably more charging stations than others, contributing to greater electric vehicle usage in those regions.

  Commercial Vehicles 
 As relatively simple as the pricing analysis is for individual consumers, the purchase and deployment of heavy-duty commercial vehicles involves consideration of many more variables. Here, the type of customer is a major determinant, whether it is a commercial customer buying trucks for a fleet, a school district, or a municipal entity purchasing buses for public use. 
 Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that electric passenger vehicle sales will rise from around 3.2 million units in 2020 to comprise 10% of passenger vehicle sales or 6.9 million units in 2025, and to 28% of vehicles sold or 26 million vehicles by 2030. This growth should support the expansion of the passenger electric vehicle fleet from around 7 million vehicles today, or 0.6% of the total fleet, to around 350 million vehicles or 23% of the global passenger fleet by 2030. Major drivers include improving battery costs, strong government support for the superior environmental footprint, stricter fuel economy standards for conventional vehicles, rapidly approaching price parity for electric vehicles, and shifting consumer preferences. 
 Environmental Benefits 
 Because heavy-duty commercial vehicles consume considerably more fuel than light duty passenger vehicles, the environmental benefits of replacing conventionally fueled commercial vehicles with electric vehicles can also be substantial. Whereas an electric passenger car may reduce green house gas (“GHG”) emissions by 3 tons per year as compared to a conventional car, replacing a conventional Class 8 port drayage truck with an electric equivalent can bring an 18 metric ton annual reduction in GHG emissions. Replacing a conventional diesel bus with an all-electric bus can achieve a 78 metric ton (approximately 171,961 pounds) reduction in GHG emissions. Electric buses can also reduce nitrous oxide emissions by 47 kg (approximately 104 pounds) per year compared to a diesel bus and 19 kg (approximately 42 pounds) compared to a clean natural gas (“CNG”) bus. As discussed below, we believe these pollution reductions have had the greatest impact in the electric bus market, where municipalities are the principal purchasers. 
 A first-of-kind, comprehensive study was released in December 2019 assessing the environmental benefits and economics of various alternative fuel truck technologies. The study, conducted by the international research firm (“ICF”), demonstrates that electric trucks and buses are a triple-win in terms of helping meet California’s climate and air quality targets; the least cost to own and operate across nearly all truck and bus classes by 2030, and provide the greatest job and economic benefits to the state. The study was commissioned by NRDC and the California Electric Transportation Coalition (an industry group representing utilities and vehicle manufacturers) and was sponsored by the Union of Concerned Scientists, Earthjustice, BYD, Ceres, and NextGen Climate America. Advisory support was provided by East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice and University of California, Davis. The study concluded that expected declines in the costs of battery packs, and therefore the cost of electric trucks and buses, will decline such that by 2030, they will be the most attractive technology from a total cost of ownership perspective for nearly all truck and bus classes, even without incentives. 
Electricity Cost Considerations 
 Despite the higher electricity consumption of electric trucks, more widespread adoption could lead to more efficient utilization of utility and power generation assets and thus not necessarily lead to higher rates. At this point, deployment of electric trucks and buses is still too small to assess their full impact on electricity prices. As a study by the clean transportation nonprofit CALSTART emphasizes, evaluating this impact will involve weighing potential efficiency benefits, the impact on utility distribution grids, including the cost of potential upgrades, and the need for additional infrastructure. In this regard, several public utilities have applied to their state’s Public Utility Commissions (“PUCs”) for rate increases to be used for the purchase or leasing of electric vehicles and infrastructure. Additional requests have been made by the utilities to offer favorable costs for electric school bus charging.

  Trucks 
 Some of the main markets for electric trucks include delivery vans, shuttle buses, and utility or work trucks, each of which has its own set of challenges. Where PHEVs (Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle) have greater operational flexibility, and require less charging infrastructure, BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicle) can be either short range, which can charge quickly and operate with limited interruption, or long range, requiring longer charging times but more intraday operational flexibility. 
 Because of charging needs and restrictions, we believe short-haul fleet vehicles that operate in a limited geographic area and return to central locations, such as delivery vans and shuttle buses, are the best candidates for electrification. 
 Transit Buses 
 Some public transportation operators are facing pressure to purchase and operate low-emissions vehicles. For public entities, cleaner transportation systems can provide benefits beyond reduced operating costs, in the form of less pollution and lower abatement and cleanup costs. Electric transit buses are likely to have lower fuel and maintenance costs, typically a large cost area for transit operators, compared to conventional diesel buses. Electric buses generally have smoother, faster acceleration and provide a quieter ride, benefiting both passengers and the surrounding urban environment. 
 Similar to other commercial fleet electric vehicles, transit buses have a higher initial acquisition cost than their traditional-fueled counterparts, and the logistics of charging remains a challenge. Electric buses can be anywhere from two to nearly five times as expensive as conventional buses. 
 In addition to the public health and environmental benefits, school districts and transit agencies also see cost savings due to the reduced fuel and maintenance costs of electric buses. While electric transit buses cost approximately $200,000 more than diesel buses (depending on battery pack size) before incentives, lifetime fuel and maintenance savings of electric transit buses are around $400,000. While electric school buses cost around $120,000 more than diesel school buses before incentives, lifetime fuel and maintenance savings of electric school buses are around $170,000. 
 Electrification in the medium- and heavy-duty vehicle sector is increasing in the United States with California leading the way. Increasing investment in the sector from public and private sources, however, is expected to generate growth and significantly increase the number of electric trucks and buses on the road in the near term. Upfront costs associated with electric trucks and buses are expected to decline significantly through 2030 as battery prices fall, making them competitive on a total cost of ownership (TCO) basis. 
 School Buses 
 School buses present another significant potential market for electrification. The United States has approximately 480,000 school buses in service that are particularly suited to running solely on electricity. Traditional diesel school buses, which make up over half the total fleet, not only consume large amounts of fuel- more than 800 million gallons of diesel a year in the United States, at a fuel economy of only 4–5 mpg-but also directly impact children with tailpipe emissions. In response, a number of states have included school buses in clean transportation mandates, and some school districts, notably in California and Illinois, have begun to replace diesel buses with electric. Incentive programs to help fund the purchase of electric school buses in the United States are significant. 
Market Drivers 
 A number of factors, including the general world-wide desire to improve the health of people, impact both the supply and demand for various types of electric vehicles and we believe that we are well positioned to benefit as a result of these driving forces. Except for energy storage technologies, discussed earlier, subsequent sections will address these market drivers in greater detail.

  We believe prominent drivers of supply include: 
 

• | the declining cost and higher availability of energy storage technologies, specifically the cost and capacity of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | grants, loans, tax breaks, and other financial support available for energy storage and electric vehicle research and development;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requirements that a specific percentage of automakers’ models be electric or other zero-emission vehicles; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fuel economy standards that require automakers to meet certain fleet-wide miles per gallon benchmarks that effectively require them to sell electric zero-emission vehicles.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We believe prominent drivers of demand include: 
 

• | mandates that government fleets purchase certain percentages of low emission, energy efficient, or other alternative fuel vehicles;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandates for transport agencies, ports or school districts to purchase or convert to electric or other alternative fuel vehicles;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | rebates, tax credits, and other incentives for purchasing or leasing electric or other alternative fuel vehicles;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the availability of charging stations and other charging infrastructure, driven in turn by government funding, tax credits, rebates, and other incentives and regulatory initiatives aimed at increasing the number of charging stations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the desire of state agencies to deploy electric vehicles to reduce the effects of climate change and to reduce the impact of pollutants on the health and well-being of its population;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the cost of electricity to recharge plug-in electric vehicles, impacted by special rates introduced by utilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preferential treatment in registration, emissions testing, and access to highways, city centers, and HOV lanes; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the cost of traditional petroleum-based fuels compared to the resultant incremental costs of owning and operating an electric vehicle.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


United States—Federal Laws and Incentives 
 There are numerous U.S. legislative efforts underway to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles. In January 2021, President Biden signed into effect the “Buy America” executive order, which among other objectives, will see a transition of the U.S. Government fleet to U.S.-manufactured electric vehicles, creating a large market opportunity for Class 3, 4 and 5 electric trucks. The order equates to approximately $25 billion in total value and will replace approximately 456,000 government vehicles with U.S. manufactured electric vehicles. The U.S. Department of Energy is also offering federal tax credits ranging in value from $2,500 to $7,500 for purchasers of qualified electric vehicles, with the size of the credit based on the battery size in the vehicle. Furthermore, federal tax credits are available for electric vehicle charging equipment, with homeowners eligible for a 30% tax credit and up to $1,000 depending on installation costs and commercial property owners eligible for a 30% tax credit and up to $30,000 depending on installation costs. These laws and incentives are rapidly accelerating the nationwide adoption of electric vehicles. 
 United States—State Laws and Incentives 
 Among U.S. states, California is notable for pioneering a number of measures that have encouraged electric vehicle production and adoption, and that have since been copied by other jurisdictions. These incentives like tax 
 
6 

  credits and rebates for both individual and fleet owners, HOV lane access, and various grant and loan programs. Besides setting the nation’s most stringent tailpipe emissions standards, California has required automakers to produce increasing percentages of zero-emission vehicles, of which electric vehicles make up a significant portion, along with creating a market that allows manufacturers to buy and sell credits awarded for selling electric vehicles. California, New York and New Jersey have also implemented voucher programs that significantly reduce the cost to purchase an electric vehicle in that state, with additional reductions to costs for businesses that meet criteria such as minority-, veteran-, or women- owned or being located in a low-income area. Furthermore, California and New York have introduced legislation to completely ban the sale of internal combustion engines and fossil fuel vehicles by 2035. The Governor of California has issued Executive Order N-79-20, which sets 2035 for a 100 percent ban on the sale of internal combustion engines for passenger cars and pickup trucks within California, with later target dates for similar bans on medium- and heavy-duty trucks. In New York, legislation has been passed banning new fossil fuel vehicle sales after 2034 and will require all new cars to produce zero emissions. See “—Governmental Programs and Incentives” for an additional discussion of certain relevant incentive programs. 
 Fleet Operator Challenges 
 Fleet operators and their companies face a number of challenges in the market today, including: 
 

• | Difficulty complying with existing and new federal and state emission restrictions and compliance requirements. Federal regulatory agencies, such as the EPA, and state regulatory agencies, such as CARB, have set forth mandates designed to reduce emissions from mobile sources. According to CARB, 12 other states and the District of Columbia have adopted California’s greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Finding cost savings while managing high fuel, maintenance and repair costs. In August 2021, the EPA proposed to revise existing national GHG emissions standards for passenger cars and light trucks for model years 2023 through 2026. The proposed standards would achieve significant GHG emissions reductions along with reductions in other criteria pollutants. The proposal would result in substantial public health and welfare benefits, while providing consumers with savings from lower fuel costs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extending the lives of existing vehicles. Due to reductions in capital expenditure budgets and the legislatively mandated addition of expensive and limiting emission reduction equipment, it is challenging to prolong the lives of existing vehicles because of the increased cost of expensive maintenance, service and repairs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Difficulty planning for the operation of their fleet when fuel supplies are interrupted, such as during a natural disaster. Existing vehicles rely on fuel that must be pumped (using electricity), which may be a challenge to source when supply is interrupted during natural or man-made disasters. It may be possible for emergency service organizations to use the large battery packs of electric drive, commercial fleet vehicles as a mobile source of stored electrical energy. This electrical energy could supplement traditionally fueled back-up generators.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Difficulty in improving the environment around these heavy-duty commercial fleets. Many studies have shown that the air quality in and around vehicles fueled by fossil fuels poses a health risk not only to drivers of these vehicles but to their passengers and those in and around these vehicles. Especially at risk are children as passengers on older diesel fueled buses, as their lungs, brains and other organs have not fully developed and the air quality surrounding a typical school bus using diesel fuel can pose serious health risks. By using zero-emission buses, trucks and cars, we believe we are creating a healthier environment in and around the vehicles they operate for their employees, customers and the communities they serve. In February 2021, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, on behalf of the California Environmental Protection Agency, released Version 4.0 of the CalEnviroScreen. CalEnviroScreen identifies California communities by census tract that are disproportionately burdened by, and vulnerable to, multiple sources of pollution.

  Our Solution 
 We are a provider of purpose-built zero-emission electric vehicles focused on reducing the total cost of ownership. Our vehicles are manufactured by outside, OEM partners located in China, Malaysia and the Philippines and marketed, sold, warrantied and serviced through our developing distribution and service network. Our vehicles are designed to help fleet operators unlock the benefits of technology that reduces GHG, NOx, PM and other pollutants, as well as to address the challenges of local, state and federal regulatory compliance and traditional-fuel price cost instability. As of December 31, 2021, we had a backlog of 37 zero-emission Class 4 trucks and 43 zero-emission Class 4 cargo vans, which consists of unfilled firm orders for products under signed contracts with customers. 
 We seek to enable our customers to: 
 

• | Add Emission-Compliant Vehicles to Their Fleets. Our commercial fleet vehicles are designed to reduce or eliminate the use of traditional petroleum-based fuels that create greenhouse gases and particulate matter.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduce Total Cost of Ownership. Our technology is designed to reduce fuel budgets and maintenance costs by eliminating or reducing the reliance on traditional petroleum-based fuels, instead using the more energy efficient and less variably priced grid-provided electricity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prolong Lives of Existing Vehicles. Zero-emission electric vehicles generally have lower maintenance costs. These reduced maintenance costs may take the form of longer service intervals between brake system maintenance, elimination of internal combustion engine oil and oil filter changes, reduction or elimination of transmission oil and oil filter changes, reduction or elimination of air filter changes, elimination of emissions systems services, elimination of diesel emission fluid use, elimination of emissions and the elimination of certification tests.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Plan for Natural Disasters When Fuel Supply May be Interrupted. Our zero-emissions systems are designed, when optionally equipped, to serve as on-site emergency back-up energy storage if grid power becomes intermittent or fails temporarily during natural or man-made disasters.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improve the Environment Around Vehicles. As a result of our zero-emission systems, drivers, operators, customers and the communities they serve could have healthier environments in and around these vehicles.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Development of the Business to Date 
 We have taken an active role in building awareness and support for our zero-emission electric vehicles and drivetrain systems in industry specific target groups and at all levels of government and regulatory agencies and the constituencies they serve. We initially accomplished this through our participation with Blue Bird Corporation (“Blue Bird”) in its United States Department of Energy (“DOE”) grant program to accelerate the adoption of advanced and alternative fuel vehicles. We have also maintained prior and current memberships in industry groups (private and governmental) and participate in their events, speaking engagements, management interviews, pilot product exhibits, fleet vehicle demonstrations and responses to requests for information and requests for proposals. We regularly engage with electric utility companies across the United States to build awareness of the medium to heavy-duty electric vehicles we currently offer and how their greater adoption could positively increase their customers’ electricity usage. 
 As discussed below under the section entitled “Other Agreements,” we have entered into a number of agreements with third parties and continue to explore additional alliances, and to establish our decentralized assembly, sales and service model. We believe we can preserve cash resources while scaling up quickly when demand requires by leveraging the unused or underutilized service technician time, specific vehicle type expertise and service facility equipment of specific partners in ways to off-load some defined tasks, providing seasonal demand adjustments to technician headcount that will partially mitigate the human resource costs and challenges associated with scaling-up or down an employee base. 
 
8 

  On March 15, 2021, we completed our acquisition of EVTDS, a supplier of zero-emission trucks, cargo vans, chassis and other commercial vehicles from which we have previously purchased vehicles designed to meet our specifications. The transaction was completed in accordance with the Merger Agreement, with EVTDS and EVT Acquisition Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”). As a result of such transaction, Merger Sub was merged with and into EVTDS, with EVTDS surviving as our wholly owned subsidiary (the “Merger”). We believe that, as a result of the Merger, we possess one of the most comprehensive product lines in our industry, with multiple new products under development that we anticipate will help fuel our growth. In addition, the resulting combination of our operations with those of EVTDS, one of our suppliers, will enable us to eliminate a step in the sales process with respect to certain of our product offerings, which cost savings we expect will allow us to reduce the cost of such vehicles to our customers. 
 Our Strengths 
 We believe the following attributes and capabilities provide us with long-term competitive advantages: 
 

• | Product Diversity. We have multiple product offerings and, as a result, the ability to scale-up, scale-down or refine a specific product line in response to market demands and the evolving local, state and federal regulatory and incentive programs. Also, within each product area, we have multiple suppliers of key vehicles, allowing price flexibility both for our final products and replacement parts required over the product lifespan. This allows us to meet the expectations and budget constraints of public or private commercial fleet operators.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regulatory Agency Familiarity. By taking an active role in many trade industry groups and related events, we strive to maintain strong relationships with key local, state and federal regulatory agencies involved in the growing zero-emission vehicle industry. To meet their own aggressive emissions targets, these regulatory agencies have encouraged the growth of zero-emission electric vehicles, especially in connection with heavy-duty commercial fleets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Relationships With Purchasers. To help shorten the sales cycles for our products, we have identified and built relationships with key commercial operators that have purchasing authority or influence over their organizations. We are also able to leverage past sales and marketing relationships that were built by members of our experienced management team and as a result of the completion of the Merger.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Additional Sales Potential. We have additional future sales potential with commercial fleet customers. These potential additional sales could include: automated charging infrastructure, intelligent stationary energy storage systems that enable higher levels of vehicle fast-charging, emergency back-up facility power for use during grid power outages, enabling technologies to access the developing grid-connected opportunities for the aggregate power available from groups of large battery packs, or enabling technologies that allow for the avoidance of electric utility demand charges.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Unique Market Knowledge. We have specific and tailored sales cycle knowledge based on the over 30 years of experience of our management team.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy 
 We intend to capitalize on these opportunities by pursuing the following key strategies: 
 

• | Develop Sales Staff. Due to COVID-19 impacts and to other business challenges in 2020, we had to eliminate our in-house sales team in 2020. We have not been able to reestablish our sales team during 2021 to help our current and future customer base, and instead relied primarily on Company executives to work on sales activity. Our executives, on a limited basis, also engaged industry consultants with ties to trucking fleets, county and city transportation managers, as well as school districts and an extensive dealer network to assist with the sales activity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build Dealership and Service Networks. Our wholly owned subsidiary, ADOMANI ZEV Sales, Inc., is a licensed vehicle dealer in California. In addition, we are building an international dealership and service network for the sales and service of our purpose-built zero-emission electric commercial

vehicles either manufactured by or for us, via Factory Authorized Representative (“ FAR”) Agreements. As an example, we have recently entered into a FAR Agreement with Shine Solar, allowing Shine Solar to promote and sell Envirotech products throughout the United States. As of September 17, 2021, we have entered into a total of nine FAR agreements throughout the United States and the Caribbean.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop Third-Party Relationships. We have completed existing negotiations with partners and are seeking additional partners for sales, service and support.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide Demonstrations. We have been and continue to seek out and respond to local, state and federal pilot demonstration opportunities in interest areas for which we have relevant current product offerings or in areas of interest that are congruent with product(s) that are on our product development roadmap, but still in early stage development. In 2021, we have participated in numerous events across the United States and Canada that demonstrated our product offerings, which consist of logistic vans, and Class 3, 4, and 5 trucks and chassis.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Obtain Approvals From Incentive Programs. Our products have been approved for various local, state and federal vehicle designations and incentive programs, like the California HVIP administered by CARB, meant to accelerate the purchase of cleaner, more efficient trucks and buses in California. Our vehicles are currently approved for voucher programs in California, Oregon, New York, and New Jersey.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow Our Manufacturing, Installation and Service Capability. As facility space and technician time requirements at partners are exceeded, we intend to expand or relocate to larger owned or leased facilities dedicated to the manufacture, installation and service of our zero-emission vehicles as we work towards becoming a fully integrated electric vehicle manufacturer. We currently lease a facility in Corona, California, to support such activities.

Our Products and Services 
 Our products and services primarily include purpose-built, zero-emission vehicles and chassis of all sizes manufactured by outside OEM partners, but to be marketed, sold, warrantied and serviced through our developing distribution and service network. 
 We engage OEMs to design and supply vehicles for us that meet our specifications. Following the closing of our acquisition of EVT, a manufacturer and a supplier of zero-emission trucks, cargo vans, chassis and other commercial vehicles in various sizes, we intend to utilize EVT’s existing supply chain and OEM partners to support our efforts to sell, warranty and supply zero-emission commercial vehicles through our developing distribution and service network. 
 In addition, our products and services may in the future include some or all of the following: 
 

• | Zero-emission electric systems for ship-through integration by outside OEMs into their own privately branded medium to heavy-duty commercial fleet vehicles.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Automated charging infrastructure for commercial fleet vehicles.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

Testing 
 Our suppliers are vetted before their products are accepted for use in our products. Our drivetrain systems and finished products are inspected, road-tested (when applicable) and receive quality control testing prior to delivery. 
Customer Service, Support and Training 
 Our sales team has historically been used as the first point of customer contact for customer support and training. However, due to COVID-19 impacts and other business challenges in 2020, we eliminated our in-house sales team in 2020. We are in the process of reestablishing our sales team by hiring sales personnel and other internal staff in 2022 to support our current and planned operations. 
Technology 
 Zero-emission electric drivetrain systems for purpose-built new vehicles generally include the following: electric traction motor/generator of sufficient kW power for grade, speed, acceleration and efficiency requirements, a motor controller/inverter system that modulates electrical power flow between the battery packs and traction motor, a gear reduction system or multispeed transmission, systems to electrify power steering/ brakes, a VCU, high-voltage traction battery packs with integrated BMS, battery disconnect units, thermal management systems, vehicle charging hardware, electric HVAC systems, DC to DC inverter(s) to reduce traction battery pack voltage sufficient to operate on-board, low voltage systems, wiring harnesses, user/driver interface and remote diagnostic/tracking/fault code/data logging systems. Although clear industry power-export standards have not yet been adopted, systems and options for a variety of vehicle-to-other power management options (such as grid, building, stationary energy storage, etc.) are being developed by multiple vendors and their inclusion may be offered as additional cost options in the future. 
Sales and Marketing 
 Sales 
 Due to COVID-19 impacts and other business challenges in 2020, we eliminated our in-house sales team in 2020. In 2022, we are building out our marketing and sales network by hiring sales personnel to form a team of dedicated sales employees with responsibility for each of the geographic regions we serve. Additionally, we have been building out an international network of FARs that promote, sell and service our vehicles throughout the United States and the Caribbean. 
Marketing 
 We plan to focus our marketing efforts on increasing brand awareness, generating demand for our products, communicating product advantages and generating qualified leads for our sales force. We intend to rely on a 
 
12 

  variety of marketing vehicles, including our website and social media, participation in industry conferences and trade shows, public relations and our collaborative relationships with our business and teaming partners to share our technical message and the benefits of our product offering, with customers. 
 Manufacturing 
 We currently contract with third-party suppliers to manufacture our products. In 2022, we intend to increase our integration efforts and begin completing the final assembly of sub-assembly components at our Corona, California, facility. In 2022, we also intend to begin producing our vehicles ourselves in the United States, which will be a key step towards our longer-term strategy of becoming a fully integrated electric vehicle manufacturer, and are currently exploring potential locations for establishing a manufacturing facility. 
Distribution 
 We intend to distribute our products both inside and outside of our current U.S. market. 
 Other Agreements 
 In addition to our FAR Agreements, we have agreements with Central States Bus Sales Inc. and with Envirotech Electric Vehicles Inc. (“EEVI”). Neither of these agreements contain any binding purchase or sales minimums. 
Central States Bus Sales, or Central States 
 Central States Bus Sales Inc. (“Central States”) in business for 45 years, is the official Blue Bird bus dealership in Illinois, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas and is headquartered in Fenton, Missouri. They are partnered with many of the best manufacturers and vendors available in the transportation industry to provide dedicated transportation solutions through exceptional service. They sell and service a wide variety of bus manufacturers, and as a result of Blue Bird’s sale of electric school buses powered by ADOMANI drivetrain systems, they have qualified electric vehicle technicians on staff. We signed an agreement with Central States and will use them to provide warranty and maintenance services for electric fleet vehicles sold by us in certain Central States service areas. We are currently speaking to Central States about becoming a FAR. 
Envirotech Electric Vehicles Incorporated 
 EEVI is a Canadian company engaged in the design, prototyping and certification of electric components and vehicles, including complete drivetrain systems. Prior to the completion of our acquisition of EVTDS, EEVI was the parent company of EVTDS. Prior to the completion of the Merger, we engaged EEVI to design and supply a series of zero-emission electric Class 3 and 6 trucks, cargo vans and chassis built to our specifications and requirements. The vehicles are initially comprised of a cab, chassis and electric drivetrain system. Any customer can then customize the trucks by adding a box or stake bed to the vehicle in accordance with their needs. We received the first truck and cargo van pursuant to our arrangement with EEVI in December 2018. In 2019, EEVI received the CARB executive order for certification. As the dealer for EEVI, we submitted additional information to the HVIP Department of CARB and received our HVIP listing in November 2019, which renders the trucks and vans eligible for buy-down funding based on the GVWR. These buy-down funds are intended to enable companies to purchase zero-emission electric trucks and receive a discount to aid in the purchase. The HVIP buy-down funding is currently between $60,000 for Class 3 and Class 4 vehicles ($66,000 if used in a disadvantaged area community census tract). 
 As a result of our acquisition of EVTDS, we acquired EVTDS’s rights and assumed its obligations under an Exclusive Supply Agreement entered into between EVTDS and EEVI (the “Exclusive Distribution Agreement”). Pursuant to the Exclusive Distribution Agreement, EEVI appointed EVTDS as the exclusive distributor of certain 
 
13 

  of EEVI’s products in the United States on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms thereof, the Exclusive Distribution Agreement will remain in effect for a term expiring on December 17, 2070. The Exclusive Distribution Agreement provides us certainty of product supply and consistency of design between different classes or type of vehicles; allows us to license the products to third party resellers, distributors and others which should enhance our ability to sell vehicles and permits us to use trademarks associated with the vehicles, all of which we believe is very advantageous to executing our business plan. 
 Raw Materials and Supply Chain 
 Prices for the systems, components and raw materials we use in our vehicles and drivetrain systems, many of which are OEM items used by many companies in different applications, can fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand. Our purchase of raw materials is currently limited due to sales volume, but we attempt to limit our exposure to raw material price increases and availability fluctuations by having relationships with a dynamic group of vendors that sell us value-added hardware, components and systems. We have further mitigated these supply chain risks by establishing purchasing relationships with multiple vendors that are diversified by type of product offered, brand of products offered, country of origin of products (which is relevant for “Buy American” provisions that we encounter with our customers), individual specification requirements, purchase quantity requirements, quality, availability and price. Our drivetrain systems allow for component substitution, which further mitigates our exposure to any one supplier or component. We believe that we have adequate supplies and access to the sources of the systems, components and materials to meet our current and anticipated future production and supply requirements. 
Backlog 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had a backlog of 37 zero-emission Class 4 trucks and 43 zero-emission Class 4 cargo vans, which consists of unfilled firm orders for products under signed contracts with customers. We believe our costs, substantially paid for as of December 31, 2021, associated with the current backlog, will be approximately $5.1 million and that the sale price of the current backlog will be approximately $6.8 million. 
Employees 
 As of April 8, 2022, we had 12 employees in total, which are all full-time employees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe our employee relations are good. 
Competition 
 The electric vehicle market is highly competitive, and we expect it to become even more so in the future as additional companies launch competing products and vehicle offerings. We compete with other alternative energy technologies, such as natural gas, propane and hybrid technologies. The electric competitors include Ford, which produces the Ford Transit Connect EV® and has made recent statements about producing an electric F-150 pickup truck and has announced production of the Mustang Mach-E SUV; Nissan, which besides the Leaf EV, produces a small electric delivery van called the NV200; Rivian, which intends to introduce the R1T electric pick-up truck; General Motors, which besides producing the Chevy Bolt EV, has made recent statements about considering the production of an electric pick-up truck and reintroducing an electric Hummer; Blue Bird has electric drivetrain options for their Type-D, C and A school buses; Navistar, which produced the Navistar eStar® and builds the electric drivetrain system for IC Type-C school buses, unveiled a prototype battery-electric version of its medium-duty International MV truck in late 2019 and a regular production eMV model is said to be coming to the market in 2021; Freightliner, which produces the eM2 and eCascadia electric trucks; Mercedes-Benz, producing the eActros electric truck and EQV electric vans; Mitsubishi/Fuso produces the eCanter electric truck; Tesla, producing a Class-8 Semi truck and recently introduced a pick-up truck called the Cybertruck; Bollinger Motors, producing the B2 electric pickup truck; Odyne Systems, which produces plug-in

14 

  hybrid drivetrain systems for trucks and buses; Lightning Systems, which produces re-power electric drivetrain systems for trucks and buses; Lion Electric Company, a Canadian-based manufacturer of Type C all-electric school buses, mini buses and a Class-8 truck; Nordresa, which produces re-power electric drivetrain systems for cab-forward trucks and package delivery vans; Volkswagen has presented an e-Delivery truck and a Volksbuse-Flex prototypes; Proterra has a full line of electric transit buses and is providing electric drivetrain systems for Thomas Bus, electric school buses; Workhorse, which builds an all-electric walk-in van and an electric prototype pick-up truck called the W-15; Chanje, which produces a large electric package delivery van; Volvo is expected to begin selling its FE Electric and FL Electric semi-trucks by the end of 2021; Peterbilt has said they will have three battery-electric truck models available for sale in 2021; Nikola Motors has said it will produce the Nikola One and Nikola Two model semi-trucks; BYD, which manufactures new electric trucks and transit buses; TransPower, which has converted Type-C and D school buses and trucks; and Motiv, which sells electric drivetrain systems for Type A school buses and package delivery vans. 
 Intellectual Property 
 The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We rely on intellectual property laws, including trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent laws in the United States and abroad, and use contracts, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect our intellectual property. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we own three issued U.S. patents, which will expire in 2030 and 2033. In addition, we maintain a trademark portfolio including common law trademarks and service marks and have three service marks registered and two trademark registrations in the United States. We have one pending trademark and service mark application in Ukraine, and one allowed trademark application pending in the Philippines. 
 Circumstances outside of our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we provide our solution. In addition, the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business, our ability to compete and harm our operating results. In addition, as the number of competitors grows and solutions of competitors overlap, we may in the future face claims by third parties that we infringe upon or misappropriate their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon or to have misappropriated such rights. In the future, we, or our customers, may be the subject of legal proceedings alleging that our solutions or underlying technology infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others. 
 Governmental Programs and Incentives 
 We believe that the availability of government subsidies and incentives currently is an important factor considered by our customers when purchasing vehicles that utilize our technology, and that our growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of these subsidies and incentives. Over time, we believe that the importance of the availability of government subsidies and incentives will decrease, as we continue to reduce the upfront cost of vehicles that utilize our technology. In order to help ensure that we and our customers benefit from available subsidies and incentive programs in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, we intend to utilize the services of incentive specialists that work directly with our sales team and our customers on these issues providing updates in near real-time as programs become available. 
Overview of Incentive Programs Most Applicable to Our Products 
 We intend to have our products approved for various local, state and federal incentive programs, including those set forth below. In particular, California’s zero-emission vehicle mandate, which requires the percentage of an automobile manufacturer’s sales must be zero-emission vehicles, has resulted in numerous incentive programs designed to accelerate the purchase and/or repower of cleaner, more efficient vehicles in California. We 
 
15 

  anticipate that the relevant aggregate funding available in California alone over the next several years may be in excess of $800 million, which includes federal, state and Volkswagen settlement funding sources. 
 California Hybrid and Zero-Emissions Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project (HVIP) 
 HVIP is a CARB program administered by CALSTART, the purpose of which is to help speed the early market introduction of clean, low-carbon hybrid and electric trucks and buses. Under HVIP, dealers and fleet operators may request vouchers from HVIP on a first-come first-served basis, up to the funding amount available for that year, to reduce the cost of purchasing hybrid and zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty trucks and buses. It is a statewide program. While the HVIP program is currently, as announced to release $197 million on March 30, 2022, working on the specific guidelines in an implementation manual to guide the release of the approximate $197 million funding currently reserved for voucher requests, we believe our customers may become eligible to request vouchers for purchase under HVIP as funds are made available quarterly throughout 2022. 
 HVIP vouchers range in amounts depending on the gross vehicle weight of the purchased vehicle and the number of vehicles purchased. Zero-emission Class 3 trucks are currently eligible for up to $45,000. Class 4 and Class 5 vehicles are funded at the $60,000 level and Class 6 and Class 7 vehicles are eligible for $85,000. Depending on project location (i.e. if in a disadvantaged area community census tract) those amounts can be increased to $49,500, $66,000, and $93,500, respectively. However, HVIP may also be revising per vehicle amounts available for future grant periods. 
 HVIP funds the purchase of only fully commercialized hybrid and zero-emission trucks and buses. Vehicles still in the demonstration or evaluation stage are not eligible for inclusion in HVIP. Vehicle manufacturers must apply to have their hybrid and zero-emissions trucks and buses included in HVIP’s voucher program. Once a make and model is included in the program, the manufacturer is not required to submit a full application for the succeeding year’s program unless the vehicle has been modified. We intend to comply with the HVIP guidelines and continue to qualify our vehicles for the HVIP vouchers. 
 New York Truck Voucher Incentive Program (NYTVIP) 
 NYT-VIP is a first-come, first-served incentive program funded by the New York State Energy Research & Development Authority. The structure and process for fleets to secure incentives is similar to that of HVIP discussed above. Eligible vehicles include all-electric, hybrid-electric, and CNG trucks and buses. Funding for eligible vehicles domiciled in New York State can reach $150,000 per vehicle. Class 4 and 5 all electric trucks are eligible for up to $100,000 and $110,000 in funds respectively (i.e., up to 95% of the incremental cost over diesel). We were named an approved dealership in the summer of 2020, and our vehicles are included on the NYTVIP eligible vehicle list for the program, which reopened in late 2019 and has $18.4 million in funds available. 
New York City Clean Trucks Voucher Program (NYCCTVP) 
 In support of the transition to all-electric vehicles, in early February, 2020, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio signed an executive order requiring electrification of the city’s entire municipal vehicle fleet by 2040. 
 In October 2020, we were named an approved dealership and our vehicles have been listed on the eligible vehicles list for the New York City Clean Trucks Program. This program provides funding for new electric truck purchases by New York City customers to replace and scrap older polluting ICE vehicles. The rebate incentive funding program provides New York City fleet owners $100,000 per vehicle for an all-electric Class 4 truck sold to them by ADOMANI, and $110,000 for a Class 5 all-electric truck. The amounts increase for Class 6-Class 8 trucks. 
 
16 

  New Jersey Zero Emissions Incentive Program (NJZIP) 
 The New Jersey Zero Emissions Incentive Program is a $15 million pilot voucher program that supports businesses and institutions purchasing new, zero-emission vehicles operating in the greater Newark and greater Camden areas by offering up to $100,000 towards the purchase of battery-electric vehicles. In June 2021, we were named an approved vendor in the Program. The Program will fund 100 to 300 vouchers ranging in value from $25,000 to $100,000 for businesses and institutional organizations looking to transition their fleets to zero emissions. Bonuses will be available for small businesses and minority-, women-, and veteran-owned businesses. NJ ZIP is funded by proceeds allocated to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority by the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (“RGGI”) for the purposes of reducing harmful emissions, especially in communities disproportionately impacted by transportation emissions, and creating economic opportunity within the state. 
Maryland FY22 Clean Fuels Incentive Program (CFIP) 
 The Maryland FY22 Clean Fuels Incentive Program is a $1 million voucher program that provides financial assistance for the purchase of new and converted alternative fueled fleet vehicles registered in the state of Maryland. The primary goal of CFIP is to reduce the consumption of imported petroleum resulting in a cleaner and greener transportation sector within Maryland. The application period opened on September 1, 2021 and closed at 5 pm EST on December 31, 2021. The Program will fund vouchers for Class 3-8 vehicles with a maximum cap of $80,000 per vehicle. CFIP is funded by the Strategic Energy Investment Fund (“SEIF”) for the purposes of reducing harmful emissions. SEIF is primarily funded from Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (“RGGI”) auctions. As in the NJ ZIP program, end users apply for the vouchers; we have encouraged our customers who have customers in Maryland to apply for the vouchers. 
Volkswagen Environmental Mitigation Trust Funds 
 Beginning in 2018, several states have allocated millions in funds per year to on-road vehicle projects. Several individual states have provided carve outs specifically for electric vehicles and, in some cases, electric school buses. For example, California, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio have each allocated funds directly to electric school bus projects. The California program will provide per vehicle incentives of $750,000. These states have been in the process of funding their initial rounds or are developing specific funding plans. We have engaged with several of these states to support the development of such plans, including funding the purchase of other commercial vehicles, provided that the buyer surrenders a qualifying existing fossil-fueled vehicle in order to qualify for the funding. 
California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) 
 CARB gathers air quality data for the State of California, ensures the quality of this data, designs and implements air models, and sets ambient air quality standards for the state, with a particular focus on regulating tailpipe emissions and other mobile sources. CARB compiles the state’s emissions inventory and performs air quality and emissions inventory special studies. CARB uses the Emissions Inventory and Air Quality Models to evaluate air quality and reduce emissions in each of California’s 35 local air districts. 
 CARB also manages several incentive and rebate programs and awards hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to reduce emissions from on- and off-road vehicles and equipment. CARB is responsible for program oversight. CARB awards grants and funds through the Air Quality Improvement Program (AB 118), the Carl Moyer Program, the Voucher Incentive Program for enhanced fleet modernization and emission reduction, and the Lower-Emission School Bus Program/School Bus Retrofit and Replacement Account. In February 2020, the CARB staff held a workshop to discuss a new fleet rule that will target a 100% zero-emission truck and bus fleet for the state of California by 2045. The rule making being considered enjoys broad political support, and has some precedent (e.g., the Advanced Clean Transit rule). We will monitor future actions on the proposal. 
 
17 

  California Energy Commission (“CEC”) 
 The California Energy Commission has several core responsibilities, including but not limited to setting energy policy, developing renewable energy, achieving energy efficiency, and transforming California’s transportation infrastructure. One goal of the CEC is to mitigate GHG emissions and reduce the impact of climate change. The CEC carries out its responsibilities pursuant to several of California’s landmark environmental laws. In 2006, the Legislature passed and then Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed two landmark pieces of legislation with far-reaching implications for energy policy. The most comprehensive is AB 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, which sets an economy-wide cap on California GHG emissions at 1990 levels by no later than 2020. At the time, this was an aggressive goal that represented an approximately 11% reduction from then-current emissions levels and nearly a 30% reduction from projected business-as-usual levels in 2020. In 2015, California passed Senate Bill (SB) 350, which further committed California to reducing GHG emissions by establishing a 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target of 40% below 1990 levels and to achieve 100% clean energy by 2045. The transportation sector represents a significant portion of California’s GHG emissions. This bill was amended with respect to implementation, but the targeted goals remain the same as originally passed. In 2007, AB 118 created the Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program. The program is intended to increase the use of alternative and renewable fuels and innovative technologies that will transform California’s fuel and vehicle types to help attain the state’s climate change policies. AB 118 authorizes the CEC to provide approximately $100 million annually as incentives to public agencies, vehicle and technology consortia, businesses, public-private partnerships, workforce training partnerships and collaboratives, fleet owners, consumers, recreational boaters, and academic institutions for projects that: develop and improve alternative and renewable low-carbon fuels; optimize alternative and renewable fuels for existing and developing engine technologies; improve light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicle technologies; and retrofit medium-and heavy-duty on-road and non-road vehicle fleets. 
 Air Quality Management Districts (“AQMD”) and Air Pollution Control Districts (“APCD”) 
 California’s AQMDs/APCDs are responsible for controlling emissions primarily from stationary sources of air pollution such as large power plants and refineries, but also have a role in distributing funds and administering incentive programs from mobile sources-primarily cars, trucks and buses, but also construction equipment, ships and trains, from which approximately 75% of emissions are generated. The largest AQMD/ APCDs are the South Coast AQMD, Bay Area AQMD, San Joaquin Valley APCD, and the San Diego APCD. Local AQMDs/APCDs develop and adopt an Air Quality Improvement Plans, which serves as the blueprint to bring the respective areas into compliance with federal and state clean air standards. Rules are adopted to reduce emissions from various sources, including specific types of equipment, industrial processes, paints and solvents, even consumer products. Permits are issued to many businesses and industries to ensure compliance with air quality rules. Local AQMDs award grants to help reduce emissions in their local communities. These grants and incentive programs include programs aimed at reducing emissions from mobile sources such as buses and trucks. For example, the San Joaquin Valley Air District’s Truck Replacement Program is a program open year-round, which offers grant funding equal to HVIP. In some cases, air district funding programs such as this can be combined with other sources including state and federal grants. 
Clean Cities 
 Clean Cities is a program administered by the DOE’s Office of Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Vehicle Technology Program. According to the DOE, the mission of Clean Cities is to advance the energy, economic, and environmental security of the United States by supporting local decisions to adopt practices that reduce the use of petroleum in the transportation sector. Clean Cities is a government-industry partnership. Under the program, public and private stakeholders from businesses, city and state governments, the automotive industry, fuel providers, and community organizations form coalitions throughout the country, which then work with the DOE to establish a plan for reducing petroleum consumption in their respective geographic areas. 
 
18 

  Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (“CMAQ”) Improvement Program 
 The CMAQ Improvement Program, which is jointly administered by the Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration and Federal Transit Administration, provides funding to states to support surface transportation projects and other related efforts that contribute air quality improvements and provide congestion relief. CMAQ funding is allocated to the states annually based on a statutory formula that is based on population and air quality classification as designated by the EPA. Each state’s transportation department then is responsible for distributing the funds. State transportation departments may spend CMAQ funds on projects that reduce ozone precursors, and at least 16 states have used CMAQ funds for alternative fuel vehicle projects (such as purchasing electric or hybrid vehicles). 
Other State Incentives 
 A number of states and municipalities in the United States, as well as certain private enterprises, offer incentive programs to encourage the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, including tax exemptions, tax credits, exemptions and special privileges. For example, Arizona exempts use tax and lowers registration fees for the purchase of an electric vehicle. Other states, including Colorado, Georgia, Utah, Florida and West Virginia, provide for substantial state tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles. 
Government Regulation 
 Our products are designed to comply with a significant number of governmental regulations and industry standards, some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed. Government regulations regarding the manufacture, sale and implementation of products and systems similar to ours are subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes may have upon our business. We believe that vehicles that utilize our technology are in conformity with all applicable laws in all relevant jurisdictions. 
Emission and Fuel Economy Standards 
 Government regulation related to climate change is under consideration at the U.S. federal and state levels. The EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) issued a final rule for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy requirements for trucks and heavy-duty engines on August 9, 2011, which had an initial phase-in starting with model year 2014 and a final phase-in occurring in model year 2017. NHTSA standards for model years 2014 and 2015 were voluntary, while mandatory standards first went into effect in 2016. In August 2016, the EPA and NHTSA jointly finalized Phase 2 standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles through model year 2027 to improve fleet fuel efficiency and cut carbon emissions. 
 The rule provides emission standards for carbon dioxide and fuel consumption standards for three main categories of vehicles: (i) combination tractors, (ii) heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans, and (iii) vocational vehicles. According to the EPA and NHTSA, vocational vehicles consist of a wide variety of truck and bus types, including delivery, refuse, utility, dump, cement, transit bus, shuttle bus, school bus, emergency vehicles, motor homes and tow trucks, and are characterized by a complex build process, with an incomplete chassis often built with an engine and transmission purchased from other manufacturers, then sold to a body manufacturer. 
 The EPA and NHTSA rule also establishes multiple flexibility and incentive programs for manufacturers of alternatively fueled vehicles, including an engine averaging banking and trading (“ABT”) program, a vehicle ABT program and additional credit programs for early adoption of standards or deployment of advanced or innovative technologies. The ABT programs allows for emission and/or fuel consumption credits to be averaged, banked or traded within defined groupings of the regulatory subcategories. The additional credit programs allow manufacturers of engines and vehicles to be eligible to generate credits if they demonstrate improvements in excess of the standards established in the rule prior to the model year the standards become effective or if they introduce advanced or innovative technology engines or vehicles.

  Vehicle Safety and Testing 
 The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (“Safety Act”), regulates motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment in the United States in two primary ways. First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable motor vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly, in part because the standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards. Second, the Safety Act requires that defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns. A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. Should we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or noncompliance exists with respect to any of our modified vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial. 
Battery Safety and Testing 
 We believe our battery packs conform to mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” which includes lithium-ion batteries that may present a risk in transportation. The governing regulations, which are issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, are based on the UN Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations, and related UN Manual of Tests and Criteria. The requirements for shipments of these goods vary by mode of transportation, such as ocean vessel, rail, truck and air. 
 Our battery suppliers have completed the applicable transportation tests including: 
 

• | altitude simulation, which involves simulating air transport;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | thermal cycling, which involves assessing cell and battery seal integrity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | vibration, which involves simulating vibration during transport;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | shock, which involves simulating possible impacts during transport;
