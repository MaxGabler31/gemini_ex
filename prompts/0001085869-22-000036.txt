Overview
Perficient is a global digital consultancy transforming how the world’s biggest brands connect with customers and grow their businesses. Our work enables clients to deliver experiences that surpass customer expectations; become more human-centered, authentic, and trusted; innovate through digital technologies; outpace competition; grow and strengthen relationships with customers, suppliers, and partners; and reduce costs. 
To articulate the full scope of our capabilities to clients and prospects, we go to market with six primary service categories: 
•Strategy and Consulting;
•Data and Intelligence;
•Platforms and Technology;
•Customer Experience and Digital Marketing;
•Innovation and Product Development; and
•Optimized Global Delivery.
Together, these service categories showcase our full end-to-end digital solutions. Individually, each demonstrates our specialized capabilities. Within each category, and collectively, we deliver a deep and broad portfolio of solutions that enable our clients to operate a real-time enterprise that dynamically adapts business processes and the systems that support them to meet the changing demands of a global, digital-driven, and competitive marketplace.
Our experience in developing and delivering solutions for our clients gives us domain expertise that differentiates our firm. We use project teams that deliver high-value, measurable results by working collaboratively with clients and their partners through a user-centered, technology-based, and business-driven solutions methodology. We believe this approach enhances return on investment for our clients by reducing the time and risk associated with designing and implementing technology solutions.
We serve our Global 2000 and other large enterprise clients from locations in multiple markets throughout North America and through domestic, nearshore, and offshore delivery centers and by leveraging an experienced sales team that is connected through a common service portfolio, sales process, and performance management system. Our sales process utilizes project pursuit teams that include those colleagues best suited to address a particular prospective client’s needs. Our primary target client base includes companies in North America with annual revenues in excess of one billion dollars. We believe this market segment can generate the repeat business that is a fundamental part of our growth plan. We primarily pursue solution opportunities where our domain expertise and delivery track record give us a competitive advantage.
In 2021, we continued to implement a strategy focused on: 
•expanding our relationships with existing and new clients; 
•strengthening our multishore delivery capabilities with the strategic acquisition in October of nearshore software development firm Izmul S.A. (“Overactive”), based in Uruguay and with additional locations in Argentina, Colombia, and Chile, and the September acquisition of Talos LLC, Talos Digital LLC, Talos Digital SAS and TCOMM SAS (collectively, “Talos”), a commerce solution provider based in Colombia; 
•delivering solutions via our offshore and nearshore capabilities in our legacy business in Latin America, India, China, and Eastern Europe; and 
•leveraging our existing (and pursuing new) strategic alliances by targeting leading business advisory companies and technology providers. 
Our multishore, fully integrated global delivery approach continues to be a key driver of growth and a compelling differentiator in the market. This was evidenced in 2021 by our acquisitions of Overactive and Talos that considerably bolstered the Company's nearshore delivery capacity, enhanced our digital capabilities, and further expanded our footprint in Latin America.
In October, we announced the acquisition of Overactive, a software development firm based in Montevideo, Uruguay, with additional delivery locations in Argentina, Colombia, and Chile. The largest acquisition in the Company’s history brought approximately 700 skilled software development professionals to the firm and nearly doubled the capacity and capabilities of our Latin American resources. In September, we acquired Talos, an SAP Commerce-specialized solution provider based in Colombia, South America. Like Overactive, the acquisition bolstered our nearshore delivery capacity, while also enhancing our commerce capabilities. 
Approximately 97%, 98%, and 98% of our revenues were derived from clients in the United States during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Excluding intercompany balances, approximately 72% and 83% of our total assets were located in the United States as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with the remainder located in Latin America, India, Canada, China and Europe.

We do this by providing solutions in digital strategy, technology strategy, management consulting, and organizational change management.

In addition, we sell certain internally developed software packages.

Our Solution Accelerators increase the velocity of solution development across key horizontal disciplines including content management, integration and APIs, business process management, enterprise search, and tax compliance. Our Industry Tools enable enterprises to address industry-specific business process and workflow challenges. We offer these tools for the healthcare, energy and utilities, financial services, and retail markets. Our strong network of partnerships and cross-platform capabilities enable us to develop and deliver accelerators across a wide spectrum of solution areas and vendor platforms.
In addition to our technology solution services and intellectual property assets, we offer education and mentoring services. We conduct IBM, Oracle, and OneStream-certified training, where we provide both a customized and established curriculum of courses and other education services. 
Competitive Strengths
We believe our competitive strengths include:
•Domain Expertise. We have developed significant domain expertise in a core set of technology solutions and software platforms. These solutions include custom applications, management consulting, analytics, commerce, content management, business integration, portals and collaboration, customer relationship management, business process management, and platform implementations. The platforms with which we have significant domain expertise and on which these solutions are built include IBM, Red Hat, Adobe, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, MuleSoft, and Sitecore.
•Industry Expertise. We serve many of the world’s largest and most-respected brands with extensive business process experience across a variety of markets. These include healthcare (including pharma and life sciences), financial services (including banking and insurance), consumer markets (including retail and consumer goods), manufacturing, automotive and transportation, telecommunications, and energy and utilities.
•Delivery Model and Methodology. Our significant domain expertise enables us to provide high-value solutions through project teams that deliver measurable results by working collaboratively with clients through a user-centered, technology-based, and business-driven solutions methodology. Our methodology includes our proven execution process map that allows for repeatable, high-quality services delivery. The methodology leverages the thought leadership of our senior strategists and practitioners to support the client project team and focuses on transforming our clients’ business processes to provide enhanced customer value and operating efficiency. As a result, we are able to offer our clients the dedicated attention that small firms usually provide, combined with the delivery and project management that a larger firm offers.
•“Instant Insights” Platform. We leverage our “Instant Insights” platform to capture and react to customer feedback throughout project lifecycles, at scale. Instant Insights automates the solicitation and capturing of confidential customer feedback and disseminates it to the proper leadership and executive teams. This proprietary process and tool enables us to quickly address client concerns and strengthen the customer relationship in the process.
•Client Relationships. We have built a track record of quality solutions and client satisfaction through the timely, efficient, and successful completion of numerous projects. As a result, we have established long-term relationships with many clients that continue to engage us for additional projects and serve as references for us. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 93%, 94% and 91%, respectively, of services revenues were derived from clients that continued to utilize our services from the prior year, excluding any revenues from acquisitions completed in that year.
•Vendor Relationship and Endorsements. We have built meaningful relationships with software providers, whose products we use to design and implement solutions for our clients. These relationships enable us to reduce our cost of sales and sales cycle times and increase win rates by leveraging our partners’ marketing efforts and endorsements. We also serve as a sales channel for our partners, helping them market and sell their software products. We are an IBM Platinum Business Partner, a Microsoft National Solutions Provider and Global NSP Partner, an Oracle Platinum Partner, an Adobe Platinum Partner, a Salesforce Consulting Partner, a MuleSoft Premier Partner, and a Sitecore Platinum Solution Partner.
•Offshore Delivery. In addition to serving our clients from locations in multiple markets throughout North America, we operate global development centers in India, China, and Eastern Europe. These facilities are staffed with colleagues who have specializations that include application development, adapter and interface development, quality assurance and testing, monitoring and support, product development, platform migration, and portal development with expertise in IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Sitecore, Magento, and other technologies. As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,625 colleagues at our offshore offices, 1,399 of which were billable. We intend to continue to leverage our existing offshore capabilities, especially in India, to support our growth and provide our clients flexible options for project delivery.
•Nearshore Delivery. Our nearshore delivery teams, based in Colombia, Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina, help our clients lower costs while receiving the highest quality of service. These teams provide custom application and software development with proven experience in complex, cloud-native product development leveraging cutting-edge software engineering technologies and practices around: DevOps, artificial intelligence/machine learning, test automation, UX/UI, commerce, cloud architecture design and implementation, blockchain, analytics, big data/fast data, chatbots and voice recognition system processing, modern scalable platforms, mobile, and performance engineering.

•Global Delivery Recognition. In 2021, the Company was named to the IAOP Global Outsourcing 100 list in the Leader category by the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (IAOP®), the global, standard-setting association and advocate for outsourcing professionals and the organizations it supports.
Competition
The market for the services we provide is competitive and has low barriers to entry. We believe that our competitors fall into several categories, including:
•small local consulting firms that operate in no more than one or two geographic regions;
•boutique consulting firms;
•national consulting firms, such as Accenture, Deloitte Consulting, EPAM Systems, Globant, and Endava;
•digital consulting firms/entities such as Accenture Interactive, Deloitte Digital, Publicis Sapient, and Computer Task Group;
•in-house professional services organizations of software companies; and
•offshore providers, such as Infosys Limited, Cognizant, and Wipro Limited.
We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market include domain expertise, track record and customer references, partner network with leading technology companies, quality of proposed solutions, service quality and performance, efficiency, reliability, scalability and features of the software platforms upon which the solutions are based, and the ability to implement solutions quickly and respond on a timely basis to customer needs. In addition, because of the relatively low barriers to entry into this market, we expect to face additional competition from new entrants. We expect competition from offshore and nearshore outsourcing and development companies to continue.
Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger client bases, greater name recognition, and possess significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to attract clients to which we market our services and adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer or industry requirements.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had 6,079 employees, 5,213 of which were billable (excluding 400 billable subcontractors) and 866 of which were involved in sales, administration, and marketing. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage. We are committed to the continued development of our employees.
Sales and Marketing. As of December 31, 2021, we had a 174-person direct solutions-oriented sales force. We reward our sales force for developing and maintaining relationships with our clients, seeking follow-up engagements, and leveraging those relationships to forge new relationships in different areas of the business and with our clients’ business partners. In addition to our direct sales team, we also had 67 dedicated sales support employees, 30 general managers, 5 area vice-presidents, and 7 vice-presidents who are engaged in our sales and marketing efforts.
We have sales and marketing partnerships with software vendors including IBM, Adobe, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, MuleSoft, and Sitecore. These companies are key vendors of open standards-based software commonly referred to as middleware application servers, enterprise application integration platforms, business process management, cloud computing applications, business activity monitoring and business intelligence applications, and enterprise portal server software. Our direct sales force works in tandem with the sales and marketing groups of our partners to identify potential new clients and projects. Our partnerships with these companies enable us to reduce our cost of sales and sales cycle times and increase win rates by leveraging our partners’ marketing efforts and endorsements.
Talent Acquisition. We are dedicated to hiring, developing, and retaining experienced, motivated technology professionals who combine a depth of understanding of current digital and legacy technologies with the ability to implement complex and cutting-edge solutions. We believe in an employee-centered environment that is built on a culture of respect.
Diversity and Social Initiatives. As a global digital consultancy, Perficient’s workforce is comprised of 30% women and 71% of our workforce identifies as Asian, Hispanic or Latinx, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaskan Native, or two or more races. We believe our diversity is reflective of our industry in our operating markets. We support our people in making a difference through active involvement in activities that strengthen the community. Our employees’ community support includes preparing women for careers in the tech industry through our global Employee Resource Group, Women in Tech, which connects women and their allies across the Company, facilitates career growth, and builds a community dedicated to supporting fellow colleagues. In 2021, Perficient also introduced its ‘Giving’ Employee Resource Group, which inspires philanthropic action and generosity, while capturing and celebrating the time, talent and treasure Perficient and its colleagues commit to helping those in need and making the world a better place. Perficient and its colleagues support a wide variety of initiatives and causes, but we place an emphasis on the priorities of advancing STEM (science, technology, math and engineering) education and improving health and well-being. Additionally, we support our community through Perficient Bright Paths, a program designed to create technology career opportunities for underrepresented constituencies and communities in the United States. Furthermore, in collaboration with the Mark Cuban Foundation, the Company hosted an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Bootcamp which educated underserved high school students in the Dallas, Texas area about AI fundamentals to increase AI literacy and understanding. 
Environmental Initiatives. We are also committed to protecting the environment and operating our business in a responsible and sustainable manner. To implement this commitment, we have adopted various policies and initiatives. We created a “Perficient Green Team” to identify and implement opportunities for Perficient employees to recycle more, waste less, and support environmentally-focused volunteer opportunities in our communities. Among our accomplishments, we have implemented a green purchasing policy for office supplies, reduced single-use drinkware, established recycling sites throughout our offices, and created informational programs to educate employees on effective ways to recycle. We encourage the reuse, recycling, and upcycling of our end-of-life electronics and computers responsibly in partnership with NiloTech Ecycling. 
Additionally, in response to our environmental initiatives, our office in Colombia received the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14000 certification based on a series of environmental management standards and our office in Somerville, Massachusetts was awarded a LEED Gold certificate by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) for its environmentally efficient design, construction, and operation practices.
Retention. We firmly believe in the power of partnership and the spirit of innovation and approach every opportunity with these philosophies in mind. We focus on a core set of solutions, applications, and software platforms and believe our commitment to our employees’ career development through continued training and advancement opportunities sets us apart as an employer of choice.
Utilization. We continually assess employee utilization, which is defined as the percentage of our professionals’ time billed to clients divided by the total available hours in the respective period. If the utilization rate of our professionals is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed and our ability to staff projects. If our utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer.
Compensation. Our compensation philosophy and programs are designed to attract, retain, motivate, and reward employees based on performance and results. Our tiered incentive compensation plans help us reach our overall goals by rewarding individuals for their influence on key performance factors and allow for differentiation so that deserving performers may be rewarded.
