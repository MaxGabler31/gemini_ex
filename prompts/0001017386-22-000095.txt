Sources of Revenue
 
Our revenues are generated through the execution of marketing and communications programs derived primarily across the sectors of event management, talent management and commercial rights as well as various media, planning and other management programs. The majority of our contracts with our clients are negotiated individually and the terms of engagement with our clients and basis in which we earn fees and commissions will vary significantly. Contracts with our client are multifaceted arrangements that may include incentive compensation provisions and may include vendor credits. Our largest clients are corporations where they may arrange for our services to be provided locally or nationally. Similar to larger marketing communications companies operating in our sector, our revenues are primarily derived from planning and executing marketing and communications programs in various operating sectors. Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated where terms of engagements and consideration in which we earn revenues vary among planning, creation, implementation and executions of marketing and communications programs specific to the sectors of talent management, event management, and commercial rights. Several of our clients have complex contract arrangements; therefore, we provide services to our clients from our own offices as well as onsite where the events are held. In arranging for such services, we may enter into national or local agreements and estimates are involved in determining both amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements.

Our fees are calculated to reflect our expertise based on monthly rates as well as markup percentages and the relative overhead expenses to execute services provided to our clients. Clients may seek to include incentive compensation components for successful execution as part of the total compensation. Commissions earned are based on services provided and are usually calculated on a percentage over the total revenues generated for our clients. Our revenues can also be generated when clients pay gross rates before we pay reduced rates—the difference is commissions earned which is either retained in total or shared with the client depending on the nature of the services agreement. Our generated revenues are dependent upon the marketing and communications requirements of our corporate clients and dependent on the terms of the client contract. The revenues for services performed can be recognized as proportional performance, monthly basis or execution of the completed contracts. For revenues recognized on a completed contract basis, the contract terms are customary in the industry. Our client contracts generally provide terms for termination by either party on 90-day notice.
 
Competition
 
In the highly competitive and fragmented marketing and communications industry, our Company competes for business with mid- size marketing firms such as Mktg, Inc. as well as large global holding companies such as International Management Group, Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc., MDC Partners, Inc. and Omnicom. These global companies generally have greater resources than those available to us, and such resources may enable them to aggressively compete with our Company’s marketing communications businesses. We also face competition from numerous independent agencies that operate in multiple markets. Our competitive advantage is to provide clients with marketing strategies that are focused on increasing clients’ revenues and profits.
Industry Trend
 
Historically, event management and talent management have been primary service provided by global companies in the marketing communications industry. However, as clients aim to establish individual and enhanced relationships with their customers to more accurately measure the effectiveness of their marketing expenditures, specialized and digital communications services are consuming a growing portion of marketing dollars. This increases the demand for a broader range of marketing communications services. The mass market audience is giving way to life style segments, social events/networks, and online/mobile communities, with each segment requiring a different message and/or different, often nontraditional, channels of communication. Global marketers now seek innovative strategies, concepts and programs for new opportunities for small to mid-sized communications companies.

These contracts provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis — Executive Overview” for a further discussion of our arrangements with our clients.
