PART I | 
ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Raven Industries, Inc. (the Company or Raven) was incorporated in February 1956 under the laws of the State of South Dakota and began operations later that same year. The Company is a diversified technology company providing a variety of products to customers within the industrial, agricultural, geomembrane, construction, commercial lighter-than-air and aerospace/defense markets. The Company markets its products around the world and has its principal operations in the United States of America. Raven began operations as a manufacturer of high-altitude research balloons before diversifying into product lines that extended from technologies and production methods of this original balloon business. The Company employs 1,304 people and is headquartered at 205 E. 6th Street, Sioux Falls, SD 57104 - telephone (605) 336-2750. The Company's Internet address is http://www.ravenind.com and its common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol RAVN.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Company has three unique operating units, or divisions, that are also its reportable segments: Applied Technology Division (Applied Technology), Engineered Films Division (Engineered Films), and Aerostar Division (Aerostar). Product lines have been generally grouped in these segments based on technology, manufacturing processes, and end-use application; however, a business segment may serve more than one of the product markets identified above. The Company measures the profitability and performance of its segments primarily based on their operating income excluding general and administrative expenses. Other income or expense and income taxes are not allocated to individual operating segments, and assets not identifiable to an individual segment are included as corporate assets. Segment information is reported consistent with the Company's management reporting structure.
Applied Technology
Applied Technology designs, manufactures, sells, and services innovative precision agriculture products and information management tools, which are collectively referred to as precision agriculture equipment, that help farmers reduce costs, more precisely control inputs, and improve farm yields for the global agriculture market. The Applied Technology product families include application controls, GPS-guidance steering systems, field computers, automatic boom controls, information management tools, and injection systems. Applied Technology's services include high-speed in-field Internet connectivity and cloud-based data management. The Company's investment in the continued build-out of the Slingshot® platform has also positioned Applied Technology as an information platform that improves decision-making and achieves business efficiencies for its agriculture retail partners. Applied Technology acquired the assets of AgSync, Inc. (AgSync), an agriculture logistics software company, in January 2019. This acquisition enhances the division's Slingshot® platform by delivering a logistics solution for ag retailers, custom applicators and enterprise farms. 
Applied Technology sells its precision agriculture equipment to both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and through aftermarket distribution partners within agricultural markets both domestically and internationally. The Company's competitive

advantage in this segment is designing and selling easy to use, reliable, and innovative value-added products that are supported by an industry-leading service and support team.
Engineered Films
Engineered Films produces high-performance plastic films and sheeting for geomembrane, agricultural, construction, and industrial applications and also offers design-build and installation services of these plastic films and sheeting. Plastic film and sheeting can be purchased separately or together with installation services. 
Engineered Films sells both direct to end-customers and through independent third-party distributors. The majority of products sold into the construction and agriculture markets is through distributors, while sales into the geomembrane and industrial markets are more direct in nature. The Company extrudes a significant portion of the film converted for its commercial products and believes it is one of the largest sheeting converters in the United States in the markets it serves. Engineered Films' ability to extrude and convert films, along with offering installation services for its geomembrane products, allows it to provide a more customized solution to customers. A number of film manufacturers compete with the Company on both price and product availability. 
Aerostar
Aerostar serves the aerospace/defense and commercial lighter-than-air markets. Aerostar's core products include high-altitude stratospheric balloons and radar systems. These products can be integrated with additional third-party sensors to provide research, communications, and situational awareness capabilities to governmental and commercial customers. Aerostar’s growth strategy emphasizes the design and manufacture of proprietary products in these markets. Aerostar also pursues product and support services contracts with agencies and instrumentalities of the U.S. government as well as sales of advanced radar systems in international markets.

Aerostar sells to government agencies as both a prime contractor and subcontractor, and to commercial users primarily as a sub-contractor. Further, sales to government agencies often involve large contracts subject to frequent delays because of budget uncertainties, and protracted negotiation processes. The timing and size of contract wins can create volatility in Aerostar’s results.
OUTLOOK
The Company achieved strong financial results, including record sales in fiscal 2019, while investing strategically for long-term growth. Each division accomplished this in ways that are unique to their specific market position and strategy. 
During fiscal 2019, Applied Technology continued its growth in sales and achieved a significant year-over-year increase in operating profit. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the division closed on the acquisition of AgSync. The Company believes the division is well positioned to execute on its long-term strategy during fiscal 2020 leveraging this acquisition and the continual investment in research and development to provide a consistent cadence of new product innovation delivered to the market. Additionally, Applied Technology is diligently entering year two of driving international growth through its Latin American headquarters in Brazil. 
Engineered Films achieved a strong financial performance in fiscal 2019 despite the anticipated decline in hurricane recovery film sales compared to the prior fiscal year. The division began the commissioning process for Line 15 at the end of fiscal 2019 and is expected to leverage the additional capacity and capabilities it brings to serve the growing demand within the industrial and geomembrane markets starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Leveraging its past investments in production capacity and acquisitions, Engineered Films is positioned to execute and capitalize on the opportunities within each of the markets it serves in fiscal 2020. 
Aerostar increased net sales significantly and nearly doubled operating income year-over-year. This growth was achieved while significantly increasing the division's investment in research and development activities to drive future growth. Aerostar achieved significant performance milestones in the advancement of its stratospheric balloon platform and broadened the base of government and commercial customers for its core stratospheric balloon and radar product lines. The division is focused on winning new contracts in order to build on the strong performance achieved in fiscal 2019.
Overall, the Company's investments in manufacturing capacity and technology development along with its strong balance sheet and access to additional funding for strategic acquisitions has positioned Raven Industries for long-term success. The Company's long-term strategic goal is to generate annual earnings growth of 10 percent.
MAJOR CUSTOMER INFORMATION
No customers accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in fiscal years 2019, 2018 or 2017.

SEASONAL WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
Some seasonal demand exists in both the Applied Technology and Engineered Films divisions, primarily due to their respective exposure to the agricultural market. However, given the overall diversification of the Company, the seasonal fluctuations in net working capital (accounts receivable, net plus inventories less accounts payable) are not usually significant.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The principal financial instruments the Company maintains include cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, marketable equity securities related to the Company's deferred compensation plan liability, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and acquisition-related contingent payments. The Company manages the interest rate, credit, and market risks associated with these accounts through periodic reviews of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and establishment of appropriate allowances in accordance with Company policies. The Company does not use off-balance sheet financing, except to enter into operating leases.
The Company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency balance sheet risk. The use of these financial instruments has had no material effect on consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
RAW MATERIALS
The Company obtains a wide variety of materials from numerous domestic and international vendors. Principal materials include electronic components for Applied Technology and Aerostar, various polymeric resins for Engineered Films, and fabrics and film for Aerostar. Engineered Films has experienced volatile resin prices over the past three years. Price increases, reflecting increased material costs or tariffs, could not always be passed on to customers due to weak demand and/or a competitive pricing environment. Predicting future material volatility and the related potential impact on the Company is not easily estimated and the Company is unable to do so to the degree required to build reliance on such forecasts.
PATENTS
The Company owns a number of patents and also owns licenses that allow the company to gain access to certain patents of other companies. The Company does not believe that its business, as a whole, is materially dependent on any one patent or related group of patents. The Company focuses its significant research and development (R&D) efforts to develop technology-based offerings. As such, the protection of the Company’s intellectual property is an important strategic objective. Along with an aggressive posture toward patenting new technology and protecting trade secrets, the Company has restrictions on the disclosure of its technology to industry and business partners to ensure that its intellectual property is maintained and protected.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The three business segments conduct ongoing R&D efforts to improve their product offerings and develop new products. R&D investment is particularly strong within the Applied Technology Division. Development of new technology and product enhancements within Applied Technology is a competitive differentiator and central to its long-term strategy. Engineered Films also utilizes R&D spending to develop new products and to value engineer and reformulate its current products. These R&D investments deliver high-value film solutions to the markets it serves and also results in lower raw material costs and improved quality for existing product lines. Aerostar's investment in the development of new technology has a particular emphasis on its core stratospheric balloon and radar platforms. The Company's total R&D costs are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Company believes that, in all material respects, it is in compliance with applicable federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Expenditures incurred in the past relating to compliance for operating facilities have not significantly affected the Company's capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. The Company is unaware of any potential liabilities as of January 31, 2019, for any environmental matters that would have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

BACKLOG
The Company's backlog represents open customer orders and funded portions of signed government contracts. As of February 1, 2019, the Company's backlog totaled approximately $38 million. Backlog amounts as of February 1, 2018 and 2017, were approximately $40 million and $26 million, respectively. Because the length of time between order and shipment varies considerably by business segment and customers can change delivery schedules or potentially cancel orders, the Company does not believe that backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any future period. However, the Company expects that any revenue generated from its backlog, as of February 1, 2019, will be recognized during fiscal year 2020.
EMPLOYEES 
As of January 31, 2019, the Company had 1,304 employees (including temporary workers). A summary by segment of these active employee include the following: Applied Technology - 450; Engineered Films - 496; Aerostar - 244; and Corporate Services - 114. Management believes its relationship with its employees is good.
