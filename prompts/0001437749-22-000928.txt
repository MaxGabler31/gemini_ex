ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General
 
RF Industries, Ltd. (together with subsidiaries, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is a national manufacturer and marketer of interconnect products and systems, including coaxial and specialty cables and connectors, fiber optic cables and connectors, and electrical and electronic specialty cables and components. Through our manufacturing and production facilities, we provide a wide selection of interconnect products and solutions primarily to telecommunications carriers and equipment manufacturers, wireless and network infrastructure carriers and manufacturers and to various original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) in several market segments. We also manufacture and sell energy-efficient cooling systems and integrated small cell solutions and related components.
 
We operate through two reporting segments: (i) the RF Connector and Cable Assembly (“RF Connector”) segment, and (ii) the Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly (“Custom Cabling”) segment. The RF Connector segment primarily designs, manufactures, markets and distributes a broad range of connector and cable products, including coaxial connectors and cable assemblies that are integrated with coaxial connectors, used in telecommunications and information technology OEM markets and other end markets. The Custom Cabling segment designs, manufactures, markets and distributes custom copper and fiber cable assemblies, complex hybrid fiber optic and power solution cables, electromechanical wiring harnesses, wiring harnesses for a broad range of applications in a diverse set of end markets, energy-efficient cooling systems for wireless base stations and remote equipment shelters and custom designed, pole-ready 5G small cell integrated enclosures.
 
Recent Event
 
On December 16, 2021, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Wireless Telecom Group, Inc, a New Jersey corporation (“Seller”), and its wholly-owned subsidiary Microlab/FXR LLC., a New Jersey limited liability company (“Microlab”). Under the Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to purchase 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Microlab (the “Interests”) from Seller (the “Transaction”).  The purchase price for Microlab is estimated to be $24,250,000, subject to certain closing adjustments as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The Company intends to pay the purchase price using a combination of cash on hand and borrowings from a credit facility.  The Company has received a non-binding commitment letter from a major commercial bank pursuant to which the Company is seeking to obtain a credit facility for up to $20,000,000, a portion of which will be used to fund the purchase of Microlab.  The purchase of Microlab is subject to customary closing conditions and to the approval by the holders of a majority of the voting shares of Seller.  The acquisition currently is expected to be completed by the end of April 2022, subject to a 30-day extension under certain circumstances.  See, “Item 1. Business—Acquisition of Microlab/FXR LLC," below.
 
Microlab designs and manufactures a wide selection of RF components and integrated subsystems for signal conditioning and distribution in the wireless infrastructure markets as well as for use in medical devices. Microlab products are used in small cell deployments, distributed antenna systems, in-building wireless solutions and cellular base-stations. Microlab’s portfolio includes RF components for ultra-wideband frequency ranges deployed in commercial wireless networks utilizing mid-band spectrum allocations for 5G mobile broadband. We believe Microlab components possess unique capabilities in the area of broadband frequency coverage, minimal loss and low passive intermodulation (“PIM”). Microlab's high performance components – such as power combiners, directional couplers, attenuators, terminators and filters – are used in broadband applications to support commercial in-building wireless networks, public safety networks, rail and transportation deployments, and global positioning system (“GPS”) signal distribution. Microlab also produces and sells various other products, including a portfolio of GPS digital repeaters and splitters for cellular timing synchronization as well as a passive systems monitor for real-time diagnostics of an in-building distributed antenna system (“DAS”). Following the acquisition, we intend to operate the Microlab business for up to one year at Seller’s facilities in Hanover Township, Parsippany, New Jersey, pursuant to a sublease. This acquisition is in line with our previously announced strategy for driving revenue growth both organically and through the acquisition of companies that offer access to new products that can be sold to a growing customer base, including through an extensive distribution channel. Microlab's products are known worldwide for their superior quality and performance and are considered the gold standard in RF and microwave distribution systems. We believe that there are significant growth opportunities in the small cell and DAS markets, and that Microlab's products will provide the Company with additional scale and opportunity for further revenue growth.

Strategy
 
Our overall strategy is to provide our customers with a broad selection of products, rapid and high-quality service, and custom design capabilities, all at competitive prices. Specifically, our strategy is the following:
 
Provide rapid and flexible design and manufacturing services. Over the past few years we have focused our organization on providing a standardized portfolio, allowing for quick-turn readily available products, while having the capabilities, flexible design and manufacturing services to customize our offering to address customer specific requirements or applications.
 
Competitive pricing. Our manufacturing and distribution arrangements have been designed to lower costs and enable us to offer prices on both our standard and custom manufactured products that are competitive with the marketplace, all while keeping quality as a priority.
 
Leverage our manufacturing and distribution capabilities and facilities. Our strategy is to operate our five manufacturing and distribution locations to best provide our customers with a competitively priced, high-quality product offering delivered with a fast turnaround time. As part of this strategy, we utilize a “one-company” approach to our five production and distribution locations and allocate our resources based on each location’s production specialization capabilities, its proximity to the shipment destination, and on other factors. Using this “one-company” approach, our goal is to leverage available capacity and shorten delivery times, while potentially providing lower shipping costs. Two of our five manufacturing and distribution locations are located in California, while the other three are in the Northeastern United States.
 
Integrate marketing and selling efforts. Our strategy is to integrate and cross-sell the product lines manufactured at, or distributed by our five facilities. We have been integrating the marketing and sales efforts of the five divisions, thereby expanding the number and type of products each location can offer its existing client base, while also using this cross-sell approach to win new customers.
 
Broad range of immediately available connector products. Our strategy is to stock a large selection of connector parts, including parts for older or discontinued products that are available for immediate delivery. As a result, we are able to fill unique connector orders, as well as provide a broad range of standard connector products.
 
Targeted focus of product lines. Our strategy is to focus on passive products rather than manufacturing and selling operating or active components or products. As a result, we no longer manufacture radio modems, no longer provide mobile management solutions and services, and no longer manufacture medical monitoring products. Our product line focus still remains on supporting and leveraging our distribution channels with our core RF Cable & Connectors, Passive DAS, and Quick-Turn Fiber/Copper assemblies offering, while in parallel we continue to expand our portfolio of integrated solutions to address key end customer and market applications.
 
Increase long-term relationships with customers. Our goal is to establish long-term relationships with the customers who have used us for specialized projects by having our solutions built into the customer’s product specifications and bills of materials. As we remain focused on maintaining and expanding our national distributor relationships through our dedicated sales and management teams, we have invested in targeted business development efforts to assist in getting more closely aligned with the requirements of strategic end customers.
 
Grow through strategic and targeted acquisitions. We will continue to consider strategic acquisitions of companies or technologies that can increase our customer penetration and/or diversify our customer base, supplement our management team, expand our product offerings, and/or expand our footprint in relevant market segments.
 
Operations
 
We currently conduct operations through our five divisions with our product areas divided into two reporting segments.
 
RF Connector and Cable Assembly Segment.
 
Our RF Connector and Cable Assembly segment (“RF Connector segment”) consists of the RF Connector and Cable Assembly division (“RF Connector division”) that is based at our headquarters in San Diego, California. The RF Connector division is engaged in the design, manufacture and distribution of coaxial connector solutions for companies that design, build, operate, maintain and use a variety of connectivity/communication applications. Coaxial connector products consist primarily of connectors which, when attached to a coaxial cable, facilitate the transmission of analog and digital signals in various frequencies. Although most of the connectors are designed to fit standard cable products, the RF Connector division also sells custom connectors specifically designed and manufactured to suit its customers’ requirements.
 
    4 

  

The RF Connector division typically carries over 1,500 different types of connectors, adapters, tools, and test and measurements kits. This division’s RF connectors are used in thousands of different devices, products and types of equipment. Since the RF Connector division’s standard connectors can be used in a number of different products and devices, the discontinuation of one product typically does not make our connectors obsolete. Accordingly, most connectors that we carry can be marketed for a number of years. Furthermore, because our connector products are not dependent on any single line of products or any market segment, our overall sales of connectors tend to fluctuate less when there are material changes or disruption to a single product line or market segment.
 
Cable assembly products manufactured and sold by the RF Connector division consist of various types of coaxial cables that are attached to connectors (usually our connectors) for use in a variety of communications applications. Cable assemblies manufactured for the RF Connector division are primarily manufactured at our San Diego, California facilities using state-of-the-art automation equipment and are sold through distributors or directly to major OEM accounts. Our cable assembly portfolio consists of both standard and custom cable assemblies designed for specific customer requirements. We offer a line of cable assemblies with over 100,000 cable product combinations.
 
We design our connectors at our headquarters in San Diego, California. However, most of the RF connectors are manufactured for us by third-party foreign manufacturers located in Asia.
 
Custom Cabling Manufacturing and Assembly Segment.
 
The Custom Cabling segment currently consists of four wholly-owned subsidiaries – three located in the Northeastern United States and one located in Southern California. Our plan is to integrate certain aspects of the manufacturing, sales and marketing functions of these divisions so as to better address overlapping market opportunities and to more efficiently manufacture, market, and ship products to our customers.
 
The four divisions that comprise the current Custom Cabling segment consist of the following:
 
Cables Unlimited, Inc. Cables Unlimited, Inc. (“Cables Unlimited”) is a custom cable manufacturer located in Yaphank, New York, that we acquired in 2011. Cables Unlimited is a Corning Cable Systems CAH ConnectionsSM Gold Program member, authorized to manufacture fiber optic products that are backed by Corning Cable Systems' extended warranty. Cables Unlimited designs, develops and manufactures custom connectivity solutions for the industrial, defense, telecommunications and wireless markets.  The products sold by Cables Unlimited include custom and standard copper and fiber optic cable assemblies, adapters and electromechanical wiring harnesses for communications, computer, LAN, automotive fiber optic and medical equipment.
 
Rel-Tech Electronics, Inc. Rel-Tech Electronics, Inc. (“Rel-Tech”) was acquired in June 2015. Rel-Tech’s offices and manufacturing facilities are located in Milford, Connecticut. Rel-Tech is a designer and manufacturer of cable assemblies and wiring harnesses for blue chip industrial, oilfield, instrumentation, medical and military customers. Wire and cable assembly products include custom wire harnesses, ribbon cable, electromechanical and kitted assemblies, and networking and communications cabling.

This subsidiary acquired the business and assets of C Enterprises, L.P. on March 15, 2019. C Enterprises is a Corning Cable Systems CAH ConnectionsSM Gold Program member, authorized to manufacture fiber optic products that are backed by Corning Cable Systems’ extended warranty. C Enterprises designs, develops and manufactures connectivity solutions to telecommunications and data communications distributors.
 
Schroff Technologies International, Inc. Schroff Technologies International, Inc. (“Schrofftech”) was acquired in November 2019. Schrofftech is a Rhode Island based manufacturer and marketer of intelligent thermal cooling control systems, along with pole-ready wireless small cell shrouds and enclosures, custom designed for plug-and-play installation. These products are typically used by telecommunications companies across the U.S. and Canada.
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization (the “WHO”) declared coronavirus (“COVID-19”) a pandemic emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted regional and global economies, disrupted global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and certain jurisdictions, including those where we or third parties on which we rely have manufacturing facilities, have also reacted by instituting quarantines, restrictions on travel, social distancing protocols and restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate. While we have continued our operations during the pandemic, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected both our operations and those of our customers. Our operations in fiscal 2020 and 2021 were negatively affected by partial shutdowns of our facilities (particularly in the Northeast United States), by changes that we had to make to our operating methods and procedures, and by a fluctuating workforce as at times, some of our employees stayed at home. Many of our customers and vendors have likewise had temporary closures of their facilities and have otherwise been impacted by changes in their industries. Further, recently, our third-party contract manufacturers have been subject to various supply chain disruptions. These supply chain distruptions have slowed the delivery of products to us. As a result, there has been some volatility in the overall demand for our products, and certain costs have increased. We have taken measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, and we continue to work with our customers and vendors to minimize potential disruptions in addressing the challenges posed by this global pandemic.
 
    5 

  

Our third-party contract manufacturers are based in Asia. Recently, our third-party contract manufacturers have been subject to various supply chain disruptions. These supply chain disruptions have slowed the delivery of products to us, and have increased the price of certain materials due to the significant increase in costs of raw materials and shipping costs. Our ability to produce and timely deliver our products may be materially impacted in the future if these supply chain disruptions continue and worsen. In addition, because of the rising cost, we may be forced to increase the price of our products to our customers, or we may have to reduce our gross margins on the products that we sell. Because some of our custom manufacturing contracts call for deliveries over a longer period of time, cost increases during the term of these agreements at times cannot be passed through to our customers and therefore will have to be borne by us.
 
The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and related actions taken by domestic and international jurisdictions to prevent disease spread, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The outbreak impacted our performance for the year ended October 31, 2021. During the periods covered by this report, the operations at all locations were affected intermittently as some of our employee schedules were impacted, and as certain customers scaled back operations or otherwise delayed or deferred orders for our products. Because of the impact that COVID-19 had on our operations, in May 2020 we applied for and received loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, H.R. 748 (“CARES Act”)  totaling approximately $2.8 million (“PPP Loans”). All of our PPP Loans have been forgiven and are considered paid in full (including applicable interest).
 
Product Description 
 
We produce a large variety of interconnect products and assemblies that are used in telecommunications and a range of other industries. The products that we offer and sell consist of the following:
Connector and Cable Products
 
We design, manufacture and market a broad range of coaxial connectors, adapters and cable assemblies for numerous applications in commercial, industrial, automotive, transportation, scientific, aerospace and military markets.
 
There are numerous applications for these connectors, some of which include digital applications, 2.5G, 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE, Wi-Fi and other broadband wireless infrastructure, GPS, mobile radio products, aircraft, video surveillance systems, cable assemblies and test equipment. Users of our connectors include telecommunications companies, circuit board manufacturers, OEMs, consumer electronics manufacturers, audio and video product manufacturers and installers, and satellite companies. We market over 1,500 types of connectors, adapters, tools, assembly, test and measurement kits, which range in price from under $1 to over $1,000 per unit. The kits satisfy a variety of applications including, but not limited to, lab operations, site requirements and adapter needs.
 
We also design and sell a variety of connector tools and hand tools that are assembled into kits used by lab and field technicians, research and development technicians and engineers. These tools are manufactured for us by outside contractors. Tool products are carried as an accommodation to our customers and have not materially contributed to our revenues.
 
We market and manufacture cable assemblies in a variety of sizes and combinations of RF coaxial connectors and coaxial cabling. Cabling is purchased from a variety of major unaffiliated suppliers and is assembled predominately with our connectors as complete cable assemblies. Coaxial cable assemblies have numerous applications including low PIM, Wi-Fi and wireless local area networks, wide area networks, internet systems, cellular systems including 2.5G, 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE, DAS and Small Cell installations, TV/dish network systems, test equipment, military/aerospace (mil-standard and COTS (Commercial Off–The-Shelf)) and entertainment systems. Cable assemblies are manufactured to customer requirements.
 
We carry thousands of separate types of connectors, most of which are available in standard sizes and configurations and that are also offered by other companies. However, we also have some proprietary products, including the CompPro product line, OptiFlex cables, and the Schrofftech telecom shelter cooling and control system products. CompPro is a patented compression technology that offers advantages for a water-tight, ruggedized connection, providing easier installation, and improved system reliability on braided cables. CompPro is used by wireless network operators, installers and distributors in North America and other parts of the world. OptiFlex is a hybrid fiber optic and DC power cabling solution that we designed and manufactured, and the Schrofftech products are energy efficient cooling/temperature control and filtration systems for use in telecom shelters, outdoor enclosures and battery/power rooms.
 
Fiber Optic Products
 
Cables Unlimited is a Corning Cable Systems CAH Connections SM Gold Program member that is authorized to manufacture fiber optic products that are backed by Corning Cable Systems’ extended warranty. Through our Cables Unlimited division, we offer a broad range of interconnect products and systems that have the ability to combine radio frequency and fiber optic interconnect components, with various connectors and power cables through customized solutions for these customers. Cables Unlimited also manufactures OptiFlex, a custom designed hybrid fiber optic and DC power cabling solution manufactured for wireless service providers engaged in upgrading their cell towers. The custom hybrid cable is significantly lighter and possesses greater flexibility than cables previously used for wireless service.

C Enterprises is a Corning Cable Systems CAH Connections SM Gold Program member, authorized to manufacture fiber optic products that are backed by Corning Cable Systems’ extended warranty. C Enterprises designs, develops and manufactures connectivity solutions to telecommunications and data communications distributors.
 
Other Cabling Products
 
We design, manufacture, and sell cable assemblies and wiring harnesses for industrial, oilfield, instrumentation, medical, and military customers. Wire and cable assembly products include custom wire harnesses, ribbon cable, electromechanical and kitted assemblies, networking and communications cabling. DIN and Mini DIN connector assemblies include power cord, coaxial, Mil-spec and testing.
Telecommunications Thermal Control Systems and Shrouds
 
We manufacture and sell intelligent thermal control systems for outdoor telecommunications equipment through our Schrofftech division. The thermal control systems, which can be controlled offsite using networked software at the telecommunication company’s own data center, maintain the interior temperature of telecommunications and other networking equipment. Schrofftech also designs and sells shrouds for small cell deployments that reduce installation time and improve aesthetics by eliminating the exterior cabling used with current configurations.
Foreign Sales
 
Net sales to foreign customers accounted for $2,464,000 (or approximately 4%) of our net sales, and $1,411,000 (or approximately 3%) of our net sales for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The majority of the export sales during these periods were to Canada.
 
We do not own, or directly operate any manufacturing operations or sales offices in foreign countries.
 
Distribution and Marketing
 
We currently sell our products through independent warehousing distributors and through our in-house marketing and sales team. Sales through independent distributors accounted for approximately 39% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021. Our agreements with most of the distributors are nonexclusive and generally may be terminated by either party upon 30-60 days’ written notice. The Company directly sells certain of its products to large, national telecommunication equipment and solution providers who include the Company’s products in their own product offerings.
Manufacturing
 
We contract with outside third parties for the manufacture of a significant portion of our coaxial connectors. However, virtually all of the RF cable assemblies sold during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 were assembled at the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) approved factory in San Diego, California. We procure our raw cable from manufacturers with ISO approved factories in the United States, China, and Taiwan. The Company primarily relies on several third-party partners for the manufacture of its coaxial connectors, tools and other passive components and receives bulk cable from multiple manufacturing plants. Although we do not have manufacturing contracts with these manufacturers for our connectors and cable products, we do have long-term purchasing relationships. There are certain risks associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers for some of our products. See “Risk Factors” below. We have in-house design engineers who create the engineering drawings for fabrication and assembly of connectors and cable assemblies. Accordingly, the third-party manufacturers are not primarily responsible for design work related to the manufacture of our connectors and cable assemblies. Although our current facilities are set up to manufacture certain lines of products, manufacturing of certain products is often shifted to other facilities to alleviate capacity limitations or to address a customer’s product manufacturing schedule requirements.
 
We manufacture custom cable assemblies, adapters and electromechanical wiring harnesses and other products through Cables Unlimited at its Yaphank, New York manufacturing facility. The Yaphank facility is an ISO approved factory. Cables Unlimited is a Corning Cable Systems CAH Connections SM Gold Program member, authorized to manufacture fiber optic products and assemblies that are backed by Corning Cable Systems' extended warranty.
 
The Milford, Connecticut facility of Rel-Tech is an ISO approved manufacturing facility that is primarily used to manufacture cable assemblies, electromechanical assemblies, wiring harnesses and other similar products. 
 
The Vista, California facility operated by C Enterprises is an ISO approved manufacturing facility that is primarily used to manufacture fiber optic and copper cable assemblies that are backed by Corning Cable Systems’ extended warranty.
 
The products sold by Schrofftech are designed and manufactured at its ISO approved manufacturing facility in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. Schrofftech’s products are manufactured and tested in accordance with the ETL Listing standards.

Raw Materials
 
Connector materials are typically made of commodity metals such as copper, brass and zinc and include small applications of precious materials, including silver and gold. The RF Connector division purchases most of its connector products from contract manufacturers located in Asia and the United States. We believe that the raw materials used in our products are readily available and that we are not currently dependent on any supplier for our raw materials. We do not currently have any long-term purchase or supply agreements with our connector suppliers. The Custom Cabling divisions obtain coaxial connectors from the RF Connector division. We believe there are numerous domestic and international suppliers of other coaxial connectors that we may utilize for any of our cabling products.
 
The Cables Unlimited, Rel-Tech, C Enterprises, and Schrofftech divisions purchase largely all of the raw materials used in their products from sources located in the United States. Fiber optic cables are available from various manufacturers located throughout the United States; however, Cables Unlimited purchases most of its fiber optic cables from Corning Cables Systems LLC. The Company believes that the raw materials used by Cables Unlimited in its products are readily available and that Cables Unlimited is not currently dependent on any supplier for its raw materials except where Corning Extended Warranty certification is required. Neither Cables Unlimited nor Rel-Tech Electronics currently have any long-term purchase or supply agreements with their connector and cable suppliers.
 
Backlog
 
As of October 31, 2021, our estimated backlog of unfilled firm orders was approximately $33.3 million compared with backlog of approximately $6.3 million as of October 31, 2020. Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demand, general business conditions and, in particular, for project-based orders from wireless carrier customers for custom cable assemblies at our Cables Unlimited division. Since purchase orders are submitted from customers based on the estimated timing of their requirements, our ability to predict orders in future periods or trends in future periods is limited. Furthermore, purchase orders may be subject to shipment delays and to cancellation from customers, although we have not historically experienced material cancellations of purchase orders.
 
It is expected that a substantial portion of the backlog will be filled within the next 12 months. Most of the orders that we receive, particularly in the RF Connector and Cable Assembly segment, generally have short lead times. Therefore, backlog may not be indicative of future demand.
 
Acquisition of Microlab/FXR LLC 
 
On December 16, 2021, the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement with Wireless Telecom Group, Inc. (“Seller”), and its wholly-owned subsidiary Microlab/FXR LLC (“Microlab”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase Microlab. Microlab is a New Jersey based company that designs and manufactures high-performance RF and microwave products such as dividers, directional couplers and filters enabling signal distribution and deployment of in-building DAS (distributed antenna systems), wireless base stations and small cell networks. The boards of directors of both the Company and Seller have unanimously approved the Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. The purchase price for the Interests is estimated to be $24,250,000, subject to certain closing adjustments as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The Company intends to pay the purchase price using a combination of cash on hand and borrowings from a credit facility.
 
The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including, without limitation, the absence of certain legal impediments, and approval by the holders of a majority of the voting shares of Seller. The Purchase Agreement contains customary restrictions on Seller’s ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties and to provide non-public information to, and participate in discussions and engage in negotiations with, third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals. The Purchase Agreement also contains customary covenants requiring the board of directors of Seller, subject to certain exceptions, to recommend that Seller’s shareholders approve the transaction. Concurrently with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, Seller delivered voting and support agreements for the holders of approximately 11% of the outstanding shares of Seller’s common stock. Prior to the vote on the sale by Seller’s shareholders, the board of directors of Seller may (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify, or modify its recommendation that Sellers’s shareholders approve the transaction because of a material intervening event or (ii) adopt, approve or recommend an alternative transaction if such alternative transaction is materially superior, subject to complying with notice and other specified conditions. Seller is expected to solicit the consent of its shareholders at a shareholder meeting to be held during the first calendar quarter of 2022.
 
The Purchase Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Company and Seller, including that, subject to certain limitations, (i) the Company or Seller may terminate the Purchase Agreement if the transaction is not consummated by April 30, 2022, subject to a 30-day extension in the event certain customary conditions are satisfied, (ii) the Company and Seller may mutually agree to terminate the Purchase Agreement, (iii) Seller may terminate the Purchase Agreement to accept a materially superior proposal, (iv) the Company or Seller may terminate the Purchase Agreement if requisite approval of the shareholders of Seller has not been obtained upon a vote taken at the shareholder meeting, (v) the Company or Seller may terminate the Purchase Agreement if certain other closing conditions are not met or waived, and (vi) the Company may terminate the Purchase Agreement if Seller changes its recommendation to its shareholders with respect to approval of the transaction.
 
If Seller terminates the Purchase Agreement to accept a superior proposal, then Seller is required to pay the Company a termination fee of $900,000.  If the Company terminates the Purchase Agreement because Seller fails to include Seller’s board recommendation in its proxy statement or Seller’s board has effected an adverse recommendation change, among other reasons described in the Purchase Agreement, then Seller will pay the Company $900,000.  If the Purchase Agreement is terminated by either party because Seller shareholder approval is not obtained at Seller’s shareholder meeting, then Seller will pay the Company its reasonable fees and expenses up to a maximum of $500,000.  In addition, if Seller terminates the Purchase Agreement because (i) the closing has not occurred by April 30, 2022 (or the end of the extension period) due to no fault of Seller, or (ii) due to the Company’s breach of its representations or covenants, the closing conditions would not be satisfied and the Company will be required to pay Seller its reasonable fees and expenses up to a maximum of $500,000. 
 
    8 

  

The Company has obtained representation and warranty insurance to cover any breach of Seller’s representations. 
 
Seller also agreed not to, directly or indirectly, (i) engage in any activities that compete with Microlab’s business and (ii) hire or solicit any employee, independent contractor, or consultant of Microlab’s business for a period of five years from the closing date, subject to certain carve-outs.
 
Human Capital
 
As of October 31, 2021, we employed 300 full-time employees, of whom 61 were in accounting, administration, sales and management, 235 were in manufacturing, distribution and assembly, and four were engineers engaged in design, engineering and research and development. The employees were based at our facilities in San Diego, California (89 employees), Yaphank, New York (63 employees), Milford, Connecticut (60 employees), Vista, California (74 employees), and North Kingstown, Rhode Island (14 employees). We also occasionally hire part-time employees. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
We own ten U.S. patents related to CompPro Product Line that we acquired in May 2015. The CompPro Product Line utilizes a patented compression technology that offers revolutionary advantages for a water-tight connection, easier installation, and improved system reliability on braided cables. The CompPro Product Line is used by wireless network operators, installers and distributors in North America and other parts of the world.
 
Our Schrofftech subsidiary owns seven issued patents on its proprietary telecom shelter cooling and control system technology and its equipment room ventilation controls. Schrofftech has also filed two pending patent applications related to ventilation and control equipment and controls.
 
The trademarks we own include the “CompPro” registered trademark associated with the compression cable product line and the “OptiFlex™” as a trademark for its hybrid cable wireless tower cable solution. Each of our subsidiaries also use various trademarks (and associated logos and trade names) in their operations, although none of these trademarks have been registered.
 
Because the RF Connectors division carries thousands of separate types of connectors and other products, most of which are available in standard sizes and configurations and are also offered by our competitors, we do not believe that our cables and connector business or competitive position is dependent on patent protection.
 
Under agreements with Corning Cables Systems LLC, Cables Unlimited and C Enterprises are permitted to advertise that they are Corning Cables System CAH Connections SM Gold Program members.
 
Warranties and Terms
 
We warrant our products to be free from defects in material and workmanship for varying warranty periods, depending upon the product. Products are generally warranted to the dealer for one year, with the dealer responsible for any additional warranty it may make. The RF Connector products are warranted for the useful life of the connectors. Although we have not experienced any significant warranty claims to date, there can be no assurance that we will not be subjected to such claims in the future.
 
We usually sell to customers on 30-day terms pursuant to invoices and do not generally grant extended payment terms. Sales to most foreign customers are made on cash terms at time of shipment. Customers may delay, cancel, reduce, or return products after shipment subject to a restocking charge.
 
Under their agreements with Corning Cables Systems LLC, Cables Unlimited and C Enterprises are authorized to manufacture optic cable assemblies that are backed by Corning Cables Systems’ extended warranty (referred to as the “Gold Certified Warranty”).
 
Competition
 
The industries in which we operate are highly competitive, and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations, most of which have greater assets and financial resources, to local manufacturers. Competition is generally based on breadth of product offering, product innovation, price, quality, delivery, performance and customer service. In addition, rapid technological changes occurring in the communications industry could also lead to the entry of new competitors of all sizes against whom we may not be able to successfully compete.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition, and the inability to do so may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

ITEM 1.A | RISK FACTORS
---------+-------------

 
Investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information in this Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations.
 
If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment in our common stock.
 
Risks Related to Our Business.
 
We are heavily dependent upon wireless and broadband communications providers.
 
Most of our revenues and profitability have in recent years been generated from products that we sell, directly or through our distributors, to the wireless and broadband communications industries. In addition, we also sell connectors, cables and other products to companies that incorporate these products into their own wireless and broadband communications products. As a result, our business is heavily dependent upon the wireless and broadband markets. Demand for our products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their telecommunication systems. The amount of this capital spending and, therefore, our sales and profitability, will be affected by a variety of factors affecting the telecommunications companies, including general economic conditions, consolidation within the telecommunications industry and the financial condition of operators. Although we sell many products into many different markets other than the telecommunications marketplace, because a major portion of our revenues has historically been derived from direct and indirect sales to wireless and broadband communications companies, our financial condition and results of operations are heavily influenced by the health and growth of the wireless and broadband markets, all of which is beyond our control.
 
The on-going COVID-19 public health pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, certain aspects of our business.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic, and the reactions of governmental and other authorities to contain, mitigate or combat the pandemic, which have severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world, have impacted, and are expected to continue to impact, our operations, and the nature, extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or any future disease or adverse health condition is highly uncertain and beyond our control. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Federal, state and local governmental agencies have taken and may again take preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations. The COVID-19 pandemic and the government’s reaction to the pandemic have significantly slowed capital expenditures in the primary markets for our products, which has resulted in a significant reduction in demand for our products.
 
    10 

  

Although we have implemented measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including reducing our expenses in certain areas of our business, these measures will not fully mitigate the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict the degree to, or the period over, which we will be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting governmental and other measures. However, we expect that the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect demand for certain of our products for the foreseeable future.
 
We depend on third-party contract manufacturers for a majority of our connector manufacturing needs. If they are unable to manufacture and deliver a sufficient quantity of high-quality products on a timely and cost-efficient basis, our net revenue and profitability would be harmed and our reputation may suffer.
 
Substantially all of the RF Connector division’s connector products are manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. We rely on them to procure components for RF connectors and in certain cases to design, assemble and test the products on a timely and cost-efficient basis. If our contract manufacturers are unable to complete design work on a timely basis, we will experience delays in product development and our ability to compete may be harmed. In addition, because some of our manufacturers have manufacturing facilities in Taiwan and China, their ability to provide us with adequate supplies of high-quality products on a timely and cost-efficient basis is subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including political, social and economic instability and factors that could impact the shipment of supplies. If our manufacturers are unable to provide us with adequate supplies of high-quality products on a timely and cost-efficient basis, our operations would be disrupted and our net revenue and profitability would suffer. Moreover, if our third-party contract manufacturers cannot consistently produce high-quality products that are free of defects, we may experience a higher rate of product returns, which would also reduce our profitability and may harm our reputation and brand.
 
Our third-party contract manufacturers are based in Asia. Recently, our third-party contract manufacturers have been subject to various supply chain disruptions. These supply chain disruptions have slowed the delivery of products to us and have increased the price of certain materials due to the significant increase in costs of raw materials and shipping costs. Our ability to produce and timely deliver our products may be materially impacted in the future if these supply chain disruptions continue or worsen. In addition, because of the rising cost, we may be forced to increase the price of our products to our customers, or we may have to reduce our gross margins on the products that we sell. Because some of our custom manufacturing contracts call for deliveries over a longer period of time, cost increases during the term of these agreements at times cannot be passed through to our customers and therefore will have to be borne by us.
 
We do not currently have any long-term supply agreements with any of our contract manufacturers, and such manufacturers could stop manufacturing products for us at any time. Although we believe that we could locate alternate contract manufacturers if any of our manufacturers terminated our business, our operations could be impacted until alternate manufacturers are found.
 
Our business strategy to expand through acquisitions of other businesses could increase operating costs and expose us to additional risks.
 
As part of our plan to operate businesses that are profitable and that reflect the changing market, we from time to time sell unprofitable divisions and purchase new businesses. Such recent transactions include the purchase of our new C Enterprises and Schrofftech subsidiaries in 2019 and the currently pending acquisition of Microlab. In addition, we have previously disclosed that, as part of our growth strategy, we intend to make additional acquisitions of businesses in the future. While we believe that restructuring our operations and acquiring other businesses will benefit us in the longer term, these acquisitions have in the short term caused us to incur additional legal, accounting and administrative expenses, including the cost of integrating the various accounting systems of our new subsidiaries, upgrading our information systems, and the cost of managing various divisions in separate locations and states. We may in the future make additional acquisitions. Accordingly, we will be subject to numerous risks associated with the acquisition of additional businesses, including:
 

● | diversion of management’s attention;
--+-------------------------------------


● | the effect on our financial statements of the amortization of acquired intangible assets;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the cost associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we may not be able to secure capital to finance future acquisitions to the extent additional debt or equity is needed; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | assumption of unknown liabilities, or other unanticipated events or circumstances.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Any of these risks could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any business that we acquire will achieve anticipated revenues or operating results.
 
    11 

  

In addition to the normal risks associated with purchasing a new business and operating at a new location, the Company’s pending acquisition of Microlab exposes the Company to financial risks because the Company will pay the purchase price of Microlab, $24,250,000, in cash. This cash purchase price will be paid in part from the Company’s cash on hand and from borrowings the Company expects to obtain under a credit facility.  In order to obtain the necessary funds, the Company is seeking to obtain a credit facility in an amount up to $20 million and has received a non-binding commitment letter with a major commercial bank pursuant for such a credit facility.  The credit facility has not yet been completed and is subject to certain conditions.  Therefore, no assurance can be given that the commercial bank will, in fact, extend the credit facility to the Company.  By using some of its cash on hand to pay a portion of the Microlab purchase price, the Company will reduce the amount of cash it has available for its working capital and other needs.  The credit facility, if obtained, will contain financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  A breach of any of the covenants could result in a default under the credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility, the commercial bank could terminate all commitments to extend further credit and elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable.  The credit facility will be secured by a lien on substantially all of the Company’s assets.
 
Our dependence on third-party manufacturers increases the risk that we will not have an adequate supply of products or that our product costs will be higher than expected.
 
The risks associated with our dependence upon third parties which develop and manufacture and assemble the Company’s products include:
 

● | reduced control over delivery schedules and quality; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | risks of inadequate manufacturing yields and excessive costs; 
● | the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand; and
● | potential increases in prices due to raw material and/or labor costs. 

 
These risks may lead to increased costs or delay product delivery, which would harm our profitability and customer relationships.
 
An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names and other long-lived assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth. 
 
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends and market and economic conditions. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability. Goodwill reviews are prepared using estimates of fair value based on the estimated present value of future discounted cash flows. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment upon unexpected significant declines in operating results, the divestiture of a significant component of our business or other factors.
 
No assurance can be given that events or circumstances will not change regarding the carrying value of goodwill of the Cables Unlimited, Rel-Tech, C-Enterprises and Schrofftech subsidiaries or the CompPro product line. Should we in the future determine that the carrying value of the goodwill associated with some or all of these assets no longer is recoverable, we will have to record additional impairment losses. In the event that we have to record material impairment charges on the Cables Unlimited, Rel-Tech, C-Enterprises or Schrofftech subsidiaries or the CompPro product line, such future charges could materially reduce future earnings, which would negatively affect our stock price.
 
Changes in technology may reduce the demand for some of our products.
 
The wireless and telecommunications industry is rapidly changing. Changes in the product demands by telecommunications and other infrastructure companies may make certain of our current products obsolete. Accordingly, we must quickly and efficiently react to technological developments and provide new products to meet the shifting demands of our customers. Our failure to successfully introduce new or enhanced products on a timely and cost-competitive basis could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and financial condition.
 
If the manufacturers of our coaxial connectors or other products discontinue the manufacturing processes needed to meet our demands or fail to upgrade their technologies, we may face production delays.
 
Our coaxial connector and other product requirements typically represent a small portion of the total production of the third-party manufacturers. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a third-party manufacturer will cease production of some of our products or fail to continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products are based. Each of these events could increase our costs or harm our ability to deliver products on time or develop new products.
 
    12 

  

Our dependence upon independent distributors to sell and market our products exposes us to the risk that such distributors may decrease their sales of our products or terminate their relationship with us.
 
Our sales efforts are primarily effected through independent distributors. Although we have entered into written agreements with most of the distributors, the agreements are nonexclusive and generally may be terminated by either party upon 30-60 days’ written notice. Our distributors are not within our control, are not obligated to purchase products from us, and may also sell other lines of products. There can be no assurance that these distributors will continue their current relationships with us or that they will not give higher priority to the sale of other products, which could include products of competitors. A reduction in sales efforts or discontinuance of sales of our products by our distributors would lead to reduced sales and could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business. Selling through indirect channels such as distributors may limit our contact with our ultimate customers and our ability to assure customer satisfaction.
 
A material portion of our sales is dependent upon a few principal customers, the loss of whom could materially negatively affect our total sales.
 
Two customers, a wireless carrier, and a distributor, accounted for approximately 21% and 11%, respectively, of net sales for the year ended October 31, 2021, and their accounts receivable balances accounted for 28% and 8%, respectively, of our total net accounts receivable balance at October 31, 2021. For the year ended October 31, 2020, our two largest customers, both distributors, accounted for approximately 14% and 12% of net sales, and approximately 12% each of the total net accounts receivable balance at October 31, 2020. None of the written agreements with these customers have any minimum purchase obligations, and these customers could stop buying our products at any time and for any reason. In addition, from time to time we also sell products directly to a few larger end-users for use in upgrading and building out their wireless network infrastructure. A reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from these customers or the loss of our major distributors or any of our primary end-user customers could significantly reduce our revenues and profits. We cannot provide assurance that our existing distributors or primary end-user customers will continue to use us as a primary source of their required products.
 
Difficult conditions in the global economy may adversely affected our business and results of operations.
 
A prolonged economic downturn, both in the U.S. and worldwide, could lead to lower sales or reduced sales growth, reduced prices, lower gross margins, and increased bad debt risks, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Slowing economic activity, particularly in the telecommunication and data communication and wireless communications industries that represent our largest target market, may adversely impact the demand for our products. If the current economic condition in the U.S. deteriorates, our results could be adversely affected as demand for wireless products lessens. There could also be a number of other adverse follow-on effects on our business from a deterioration of economic conditions or from a credit crisis, including insolvency of certain key distributors, key suppliers, contract manufacturers and customers.
 
Because the markets in which we compete are highly competitive, a failure to effectively compete could result in an immediate and substantial loss of market share.
 
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we expect that competition will increase in these markets. In particular, the wireless and telecommunications markets in which most of our products are sold are intensely competitive. A failure to effectively compete in these markets could result in an immediate and substantial loss of revenues and market share. Because most of our sales are derived from products that are neither proprietary nor can be used to distinguish us from our competitors, our ability to compete successfully in these markets depends on a number of factors, including:
 

● | product quality; 
--+------------------------------------------------
● | reliability; 
● | customer support; 
● | time-to-market; 
● | price; 
● | market acceptance of competitors’ products; and
● | general economic conditions. 

 
Our revenues may suffer if we are not able to effectively satisfy our customers in each of the foregoing ways. In addition, our competitors or customers may offer enhancements to its existing products or offer new products based on new technologies, industry standards or customer requirements that have the potential to replace or provide lower cost or higher performance alternatives to our products. The introduction of enhancements or new products by our competitors could render our existing and future products obsolete or unmarketable.
 
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources. In certain circumstances, our customers or potential customers have internal or may in the future institute manufacturing capabilities with which we may compete.
 
    13 

  

If the industries into which we sell our products experience recession or other cyclical effects impacting the budgets of our customers, our operating results could be negatively impacted.
 
The primary customers for our connector and cable products are in the wireless communications industries. Any significant downturn in our customers’ markets, in particular, or in general economic conditions which result in the cut back of budgets would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm our business. Historically, the communications industry has been cyclical, affected by both economic conditions and industry-specific cycles. Depressed general economic conditions and cyclical downturns in the communications industry have each had an adverse effect on sales of communications equipment, OEMs and their suppliers, including us. No assurance can be given that the wireless communications industry will not experience a material downturn in the near future. Any cyclical downturn in the communications industry could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
Because we sell our products to foreign customers, we are exposed to all of the risks associated with international sales, including foreign currency exposure.
 
Sales to customers located outside the United States, either directly or through U.S. and foreign distributors, accounted for approximately 4% and 3% of our net sales during the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. International revenues are subject to a number of risks, including:
 

● | longer accounts receivable payment cycles; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | difficulty in enforcing agreements and in collecting accounts receivable;
● | tariffs and other restrictions on foreign trade; 
● | economic and political instability; and the 
● | burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws. 

 
Our foreign sales are also affected by general economic conditions in international markets. A prolonged economic downturn in our foreign markets could have an adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that the factors described above will not have an adverse material effect on our future international revenues and, consequently, on our financial condition, results of operations and business.
 
Since sales made to foreign customers or foreign distributors have historically been in U.S. dollars, we have not been exposed to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations. However, if we in the future are required to accept sales denominated in the currencies of the countries where sales are made, we will thereafter also be exposed to currency fluctuation risks.
 
The inability to hire or retain certain key professionals, management and staff could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them. However, other than the employment agreement we have entered into with Mr. Dawson, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, we currently do not have any other written employment agreements with our executive officers and managers. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive and the cost for new employees may exceed the cost of existing employees. The loss of key management and technical personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
 
We have few patent rights in the technology employed in our products, which may limit our ability to compete.
 
Other than the patents that we own related to the CompPro proprietary product line and the Schrofftech telecom shelter cooling products and control systems, we do not hold any other United States or foreign patents. Since we do not seek to protect our rights in the technology that we develop or that our third-party contract manufacturers develop for us by means of the patent laws, competitors can and do sell most of the same products as us, and we cannot prevent or restrict such competition.
 
A cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.
 
Businesses have become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations. Additionally, we may be exposed to increased cybersecurity risks as a result of remote working requirements imposed on us as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. A cyberattack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption or result in denial of service on websites. We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure, to process and record financial and operating data, and communicate with our employees and business partners. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. Although to date we have not experienced any losses relating to cyberattacks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. In addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches.

Risks Related to Our Common Stock
 
Volatility of trading prices of our stock could result in a loss on an investment in our stock.
 
The market price of our common stock has varied greatly, and the trading volume of our common stock has fluctuated greatly as well. These fluctuations often occur independently of our performance or any of our announcements. Factors that may result in such fluctuations include:

● | any shortfall in revenues or net income from revenues or net income expected by securities analysts, or a net loss in our quarterly or annual operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fluctuations in our financial results or the results of other communications-related companies, including those of our direct competitors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | general conditions in the connector and communications industries;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in our revenue growth rates or the growth rates of our competitors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | sales of large blocks of our common stock; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | conditions in the financial markets in general.
--+------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the stock market may, from time to time, experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may be unrelated to the operating performance of any specific company. Accordingly, the market prices of our common stock may be expected to experience significant fluctuations in the future.
 
Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting or to remediate weaknesses could materially harm our revenues, erode stockholder confidence in our ability to pursue business and report our financial results/condition, and negatively affect the trading price of our common stock.
 
As a public reporting company, we are required to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Failure to establish such internal control, or any failure of such internal control once established, could adversely impact our public disclosures regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any failure of our internal control over financial reporting could also prevent us from maintaining accurate accounting records and discovering accounting errors and financial frauds.
 
Rules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are complex, and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. Any assessment by management that there are weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in the internal controls over financial reporting (including those weaknesses identified in periodic reports), or disclosure of management’s assessment of the internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.
 
As of October 31, 2021 and 2020, we determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective. However, no assurance can be given that there will not be failures in our internal controls in future periods.
 
While we have in the past paid dividends, no assurance can be given that we will declare or pay cash dividends in the future.
 
During fiscal 2021, we did not make any dividend distributions to our stockholders. Dividends are declared and paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors subject to applicable laws, and depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, plans for future acquisitions, contractual restrictions, general business conditions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Therefore, even if our operations return to their prior level of profitability, any decision to pay dividends in the future will depend on various other factors that the Board may consider relevant. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will once again pay dividends in the future. If we do not pay a cash dividend, our stockholders will not realize a return on their investment in the common stock except to the extent of any appreciation in the value of the common stock. 
 
Future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.
 
The average trading volume of our shares of common stock is relatively small. As a result, sales of a significant number of shares, or the perception that significant sales could occur, could result in a decline in our stock price. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.
 
    15 

  

As of October 31, 2021, we had 10,058,571 shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, we had outstanding options for the purchase of 618,522 shares of common stock, the exercise of which would increase the number of common stock outstanding. The issuance and subsequent sale of the shares underlying these stock options could depress the trading price of our common stock. As of October 31, 2021, we also had 1,123,232 shares available for future grant as stock options or restricted shares, the issuance and sale of which could also impact our stock price.
 
We are a “smaller reporting company” and we have elected to comply with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.
 
We are a “smaller reporting company,” as defined in the Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which allows us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies, including (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and (2) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. In addition, we are only required to provide two years of audited financial statements in our SEC reports. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. Our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until we are no longer a “smaller reporting company”. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls in the future.
