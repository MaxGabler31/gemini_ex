Item 1. Business 
OVERVIEW 
 The Company designs, sources and sells branded kitchenware, tableware and other products used in the home and markets its products under a number of widely-recognized brand names and trademarks, which are either owned or licensed by the Company, or through retailers private labels and their licensed brands. The Companys products, which are targeted primarily towards consumer purchases of moderately priced kitchenware, tableware and housewares, are sold through virtually every major level of trade. The Company generally markets several lines within each of its product categories under more than one brand. The Company sells its products directly to retailers (including through their Internet websites) and, to a lesser extent, to distributors. The Company also sells a limited selection of its products directly to consumers through its own Internet websites. At the heart of the Company is a culture of innovation. The Company expects to introduce approximately 4,000 new or redesigned products globally in 2018. Newly introduced products generally reach their peak sales in 12 to 18 months. 
 The Companys product categories include two categories of products used to prepare, serve and consume foods, Kitchenware (kitchen tools and gadgets, cutlery, cutting boards, shears, cookware, pantryware, spice racks and bakeware) and Tableware (dinnerware, stemware, flatware and giftware); and one category, Home Solutions, which comprises other products used in the home (thermal beverageware, food storage, neoprene travel products and home décor). 
 The Company has a presence in international markets through subsidiaries and affiliate companies that are based outside of the United States. Lifetime Brands Europe is comprised of the Kitchen Craft business, acquired in 2014, and Creative Tops, acquired in 2011. Kitchen Craft is a leading supplier of kitchenware products and accessories in the U.K. and in over 80 countries. Creative Tops is a supplier of private label and branded tableware products (including La Cafetière and Randwyck brands, acquired in 2014) in the U.K. and other countries in Europe. The Company also has a subsidiary in China to supply kitchenware and tableware products to the market and a subsidiary based in Hong Kong to facilitate the sale of its products to other parts of Asia and smaller markets elsewhere in the world. The Company has a presence in Mexico and other parts of Latin America (excluding Brazil) through its 30% equity interest in Grupo Vasconia, S.A.B. (Vasconia), a housewares company and aluminum manufacturer based in Mexico; and a strategic alliance with a Canadian company to distribute many of the Companys products in Canada. 
 The Company continually evaluates opportunities to expand the reach of its brands and to invest in other companies that operate principally outside the United States and that own or license complementary brands. These opportunities involve risks as the industry and foreign markets may not evolve as anticipated and the Companys objectives may not be achieved. 
 In addition to seeking opportunities to expand the Companys international footprint, the Company regularly evaluates potential acquisitions of businesses or product lines to grow its product offerings and distribution in the United States market. In December 2012, the Company acquired Fred® & Friends, a business which designs and markets novelty housewares and other products under the Fred® brand. The acquisition resulted in an expansion of the Companys Kitchenware product category to include novelty kitchen tools, tableware accessories, party goods, personal accessories and other products. In 2014, the Company acquired certain assets of Built NY, a designer and distributor of brightly colored, uniquely patterned neoprene travel products, including bags, totes, cases and sleeves, and acquired the business and assets of Empire Silver Company, a manufacturer of sterling silver and pewter giftware products. 
 In 2016, the Company further expanded its brand portfolio through the acquisition of certain brands and certain other assets of Wilton Armetale, the acquisition of certain assets of the Kitchen division of Focus Products Group, LLC, and the acquisition of the Copco® product line. The Focus Products Group acquisition included kitchenware and bakeware products marketed under the Amco Houseworks®, Chicago Metallic and Swing-A-Way® brands. The Copco® product line specializes in thermal and hydration beverageware, tea kettles and kitchen organization products. In 2017, the Company acquired the Fitz and Floyd business. Fitz and Floyd designs, sources, markets and distributes Fitz and Floyd® and other branded tabletop products and decorative ceramic collections.
