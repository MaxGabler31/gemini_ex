Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
MJ Holdings, Inc. (OTCPK: MJNE) is a highly-diversified cannabis holding company providing cultivation management, asset and infrastructure development – currently concentrated in the Las Vegas market. It is the Company’s intention to grow its business and provide a 360-degree spectrum of infrastructure, including, cannabis cultivation, production of cannabis related products, management services, dispensaries and consulting services. The Company intends to grow its business through joint ventures with existing companies possessing complementary subject matter expertise, acquisition of existing companies and through the development of new opportunities. The Company intends to “prove the concept” profitably in the rapidly expanding Las Vegas market and then use that anticipated success as a template for replicating the concept in other developing states through a combination of strategic partnerships, acquisitions and opening new operations.
 
Operational highlights:
 

● | a three-acre, hybrid, outdoor, marijuana-cultivation facility (the “Cultivation Facility”) located in the Amargosa Valley of Nevada. The Company had the contractual right to manage and cultivate marijuana on this property until 2026, for which it would have received sixty percent (60%) of the net revenues realized from its management of this facility and twenty-five percent (25%) of the net revenues from equipment rental. The licensed facility is owned by Acres Cultivation, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Curaleaf Holdings, Inc. On January 21, 2021, the Company received a Notice of Termination, effective immediately, from Acres Cultivation, LLC. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company relocated all of its equipment utilized on the Acres lease to its 260 Acres adjacent to the Acres lease. The Company will not generate any further revenue under the Acres relationship.

● | 260 acres of farmland for the purpose of cultivating additional marijuana (the “260 Acres”) purchased in January of 2019. The Company intends to utilize the state-of-the-art Cravo® cultivation system for growing an additional five acres of marijuana on this property. The Cravo® system will allow multiple harvests per year and should result in higher annual yields per acre. The land has more than 180-acre feet of permitted water rights, which will provide more than sufficient water to markedly increase the Company’s marijuana cultivation capabilities. This facility, upon receipt of its business license in Nye County and its final inspection by the Cannabis Compliance Board (“CCB”), is expected to become operational in the summer of 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company elected to relocate all of its equipment utilized on the Acres lease to its 260 Acres adjacent to the Acres lease. The Company will utilize the 260 Acres for its own harvest along with additional harvests under any Cultivation and Sales Agreements.

● | Cultivation and Sales Agreements entered into for multiple grows on the Company’s 260 Acres located in the Amargosa Valley of Nevada. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company entered into separate Cultivation and Sales Agreements, whereby the Company shall retain certain independent growers to provide oversight and management of the Company’s cultivation and sale of products at its 260 Acres. The independent growers shall pay to the Company a royalty of net sales revenue with a minimum royalty after two years. As of the date of this filing, the Company is waiting on its business license in Nye County and its final inspection by the Cannabis Compliance Board before it can commence its operations under the Agreement. 


● | a nearby commercial trailer and RV park (THC Park – Tiny Home Community) was purchased in April of 2019 to supply necessary housing for the Company’s farm employees. After the Company’s 2018 harvest, it came to realize that it would need to find a more efficient method of housing and to bring its cultivation team to its facilities. The Company purchased the 50-acre plus THC Park for $600,000 in cash and $50,000 of the Company’s restricted common stock. At present, the Company’s construction and completion of this community is approximately seventy-five present complete. The impact of COVID-19 in obtaining inspections and permitting significantly delayed the completion of this community. The Company has elected to cease any renovations or additions at its Tiny Home Community until it plants its first grow on the 260 Acres and can better evaluate the need for additional housing.

On April 12, 2022, the CCB issued an Adult-Use Production License to MJ Distributing P133, LLC and an Adult-Use Cultivation License to MJ Distributing C202, LLC. The Company is currently awaiting its business license to be issued by Nye County, Nevada.

● | indoor cultivation facility build-out in the City of Las Vegas (the “Indoor Facility”). Through its former subsidiary, Red Earth, LLC (“Red Earth”), the Company held a Medical Marijuana Establishment Registration Certificate, Application No. C012. In August of 2019, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Element NV, LLC (“Element”), to sell a 49% interest in the license. Under the terms of the Agreement, Element was required to invest more than $3,500,000 into this Indoor Facility. Element paid the monthly rent on the facility from December 2019 through March 2020 but failed to make any additional payments. On June 11, 2020, the Company entered into the First Amendment (“First Amendment”) to the Agreement. Under the terms of the First Amendment, the Closing Purchase Price was adjusted to $441,000, and Element was required to make a capital contribution (the “Initial Contribution Payment”) to the Target Company in the amount of $120,000 and was required to make an additional cash contribution (the Final Contribution Payment”) in the amount of $240,000. The Company terminated its discussions with Element regarding its past due payments. On or about May 7, 2021, Red Earth, received an inquiry from the State of Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board (“CCB”) regarding the transfer of ownership of the Subsidiary from its previous owners to the Company. The CCB has determined that the transfer was not formally approved, thus a Category II violation. On July 27, 2021, Red Earth entered into a Stipulation and Order for Settlement of Disciplinary Action (the “Stipulation Order”) with the CCB. Under the terms of the Stipulation Order, Red Earth agreed to present to the CCB, by not later than August 31, 2021, a plan pursuant to which the ownership of Red Earth would be returned to the original owners. The Parties to the Stipulation Order resolved the matter without the necessity of taking formal action. Red Earth agreed to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which was paid on July 29, 2021. On August 26, 2021, the Company and the Company’s Chief Cultivation Officer and previous owner of Red Earth, Paris Balaouras, entered into a Termination Agreement. Under the terms of the Termination Agreement, the Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated December 15, 2017, entered into between the Company and Red Earth was terminated as of the date of the Termination Agreement resulting in the return of ownership of Red Earth to Mr. Balaouras. Neither party shall have any further obligation to one another pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. 

 
The Company may also continue to seek to identify potential acquisitions of revenue producing assets and licenses within legalized cannabis markets that can maximize shareholder value.
 
The Company may face substantial competition in the operation of cultivation facilities in Nevada. Numerous other companies have also been granted cultivation licenses, and, therefore, the Company anticipates that it will face competition from these other companies. The Company’s management team has experience in successfully developing, implementing, and operating marijuana cultivation and related businesses in other legal cannabis markets. The Company believes its experience in outdoor cultivation provides it with a distinct competitive advantage over its competitors, and it will continue to focus on this area of its operations. The Company still faces challenges engaging and retaining senior managers.

COVID-19
 
The novel coronavirus commonly referred to as “COVID-19” was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency, and on March 11, 2020, the spread of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. On March 13, 2020, the spread of COVID-19 was declared a national emergency by former President Donald Trump. The outbreak has spread throughout Europe, the Middle East and North America, causing companies and various international jurisdictions to impose restrictions such as quarantines, business closures and travel restrictions. While these effects are expected to be temporary, the duration of the business disruptions internationally and related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The rapid development of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures being taken by governments and private parties to respond to it are extremely fluid. While the Company has continuously sought to assess the potential impact of the pandemic on its financial and operating results, any assessment is subject to extreme uncertainty as to probability, severity and duration of the pandemic as reflected by infection rates at local, state, and regional levels. The Company has attempted to assess the impact of the pandemic by identifying risks in the following principal areas:
 
● Mandatory Closures. In response to the pandemic, many states and localities implemented mandatory closures of, or limitations to, businesses to prevent the spread of COVID-19; this impacted the Company’s operations. More recently, the mandatory closures that impacted the Company’s operations were lifted and the Company resumed full operations, albeit subject to various COVID-19 related precautions and changes in local infection rates. The Company’s ability to generate revenue would be materially impacted by any future shut down of its operations.
 
● Customer Impact. While the Company has not experienced an overall downturn in demand for its products in connection with the pandemic, if its customers become ill with COVID-19, are forced to quarantine, decide to self-quarantine or not to visit stores where its products may be sold or distribution points to observe “social distancing”, it may have material negative impact on demand for its products while the pandemic continues. While the Company has implemented measures, to reduce infection risk to its customers, regulators may not permit such measures, or such measures may not prevent a reduction in demand.
 
● Supply Chain Disruption. The Company relies on third party suppliers for equipment and services to produce its products and keep its operations going. If its suppliers are unable to continue operating due to mandatory closures or other effects of the pandemic, it may negatively impact its own ability to continue operating. At this time, the Company has not experienced any failure to secure critical supplies or services. However, disruptions in the Company’s supply chain may affect its ability to continue certain aspects of the Company’s operations or may significantly increase the cost of operating its business and significantly reduce its margins.
 
● Staffing Disruption. The Company is, for the time being, implementing among its staff where feasible “social distancing” measures recommended by such bodies as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Presidential Administration, as well as state and local governments. The Company has cancelled non-essential travel by employees, implemented remote meetings where possible, and permitted all staff who can work remotely to do so. For those whose duties require them to work on-site, measures have been implemented to reduce infection risk, such as reducing contact with customers, mandating additional cleaning of workspaces and hand disinfection, providing masks and gloves to certain personnel, and contact tracing following reports of employee infection. Nevertheless, despite such measures, the Company may find it difficult to ensure that its operations remain staffed due to employees falling ill with COVID-19, becoming subject to quarantine, or deciding not to come to come to work on their own volition to avoid infection. At certain locations, the Company has experienced increased absenteeism due to increased COVID-19 infection rates in certain locales. If such absenteeism increases, the Company may not be able, including through replacement and temporary staff, to continue to operate at desired levels in some or all locations.
 
● Regulatory Backlog. Regulatory authorities, including those that oversee the cannabis industry on the state level, are heavily occupied with their response to the pandemic. These regulators as well as other executive and legislative bodies in the states in which the Company operates may not be able to provide the level of support and attention to day-to-day regulatory functions as well as to needed regulatory development and reform that they would otherwise have provided. Such regulatory backlog may materially hinder the development of the Company’s business by delaying such activities as product launches, facility openings and approval of business acquisitions, thus materially impeding development of its business. The Company is actively addressing the risk to business continuity represented by each of the above factors through the implementation of a broad range of measures throughout its structure and is reassessing its response to the COVID-19 pandemic on an ongoing basis. The above risks individually or collectively may have a material impact on the Company’s ability to generate revenue. Implementing measures to remediate the risks identified above may materially increase the Company’s costs of doing business, reduce its margins and potentially result in losses. While the Company has not to date experienced any overall material negative impact on its operations or financial results related to the impact of the pandemic, so long as the pandemic and measures taken in response to the pandemic are not abated, substantial risk of such impact remains, which could negatively impact the Company’s ability to generate revenue and/or profits, raise capital and complete its development plans.
 
● Limited availability of vaccine. On December 11, 2020, the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer BioN-Tech COVID-19 vaccine, the first such approval. Additional EUAs were issued on December 18, 2020 for a vaccine created by Moderna, and on February 27, 2021 for a vaccine created by Janssen Biotech (a Johnson & Johnson affiliate). As of April 4, 2021, the CDC reports that approximately 168 million doses of the various vaccines have been administered in the U.S., although both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require the administration of two doses for full effectiveness. On March 2, 2021, President Biden stated that the U.S. will have sufficient vaccine supply for all adults by the end of May 2021. Actual delivery of the vaccines to individuals, however, is controlled by state and local governments using various prioritization criteria and states continue to impose activity limitations and other precautions on businesses during this period until the vaccine is widely disseminated. In addition, there can be no assurance of when the Company’s employees in any particular jurisdiction will be able to access the vaccine. Moreover, there can be no assurance that all employees will choose to avail themselves of the vaccine or, if so, when they will choose to do so. The same applies to the Company’s, customers, regulators, and suppliers. Consequently, the COVID-19 risk factors described above continue to be applicable.

Our Business History
 
In April 2018, the Company entered into a management agreement with Acres Cultivation, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (the “Licensed Operator”) that holds a license for the legal cultivation of marijuana for sale under the laws of the State of Nevada. In January of 2019, the Company entered into a revised agreement, which replaced the April 2018 agreement, with the Licensed Operator in order to be more stringently aligned with Nevada marijuana laws. The material terms of the agreement remain unchanged. The Licensed Operator is contractually obligated to pay over to the Company sixty percent (60%) of the net revenues realized from its management of this facility and twenty-five percent (25%) of the net revenues from equipment rental. The agreement is to remain in force until April 2026. In April 2019, the Licensed Operator was acquired by Curaleaf Holdings, Inc., a publicly traded Canadian cannabis company. The acquisition was subject to all of the contractual obligations between the Company and the Licensed Operator. 
 
In April 2018, the State of Nevada finalized and approved the transfer of provisional Medical Marijuana Establishment Registration Certificate No. 012 (the “Certificate”) from Acres Medical, LLC to the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Red Earth, LLC (“Red Earth”). HDGLV, LLC (“HDGLV”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Red Earth, holds a triple-net leasehold interest in a 17,298 square-foot commercial building located on Western Avenue in the City of Las Vegas, which will be home to the Company’s indoor cultivation facility (the “Western Facility”).

In August of 2018, the Company received final approval from the State of Nevada, Department of Taxation, to commence cultivation activities with respect to the Certificate. Contemporaneously therewith, Red Earth was issued a Business License by the City of Las Vegas to operate a marijuana cultivation facility at the Western Facility. In October of 2018, the Company was requested by the City of Las Vegas Department of Building & Safety to make additional modifications to the building, specifically the removal and remediation of all asbestos materials in the building, which was completed in June of 2019 at a cost of approximately $140,000. In July of 2019, the City of Las Vegas asked the Company to amend its Business License and modify its Special Use Permit (“SUP”) to conform with updated marijuana cultivation requirements within the City. A new SUP was granted on October 9, 2019. The Company expects to receive its new business license in Q4 of 2020, which will then allow the Company to commence legal marijuana cultivation activities within the City of Las Vegas. As of August 26, 2021, the Company was no longer the owner of HDGLV as per the terms of the Termination Agreement between the Company and Paris Balaouras.

The Company has joined with more than 15 other plaintiffs in an action against the State of Nevada in regard to how the applications were scored and as to why licenses were granted to other applicants in contravention of the guidelines published by the State of Nevada. On August 23, 2019, a Nevada District Court judge issued a preliminary injunction enjoining any of the entities that were granted licenses from opening new dispensaries based upon the failure of NVDOT (the administrative body tasked with adopting and enforcing marijuana regulations within the State of Nevada) to enforce a provision of Ballot Question 2 (“BQ2”), that was approved by Nevada voters in 2016 and adopted by the Nevada legislature and codified as NRS 453D, which legalized the sale and distribution of recreational use marijuana. The law requires that “each prospective owner, officer and board member of a marijuana establishment license applicant” undergo a background check. The judge found that many of the successful license applicants failed to comply with this requirement. On August 29, 2019, the judge modified the ruling and is allowing thirteen of the successful license applicants who the State of Nevada have certified as having complied with the requirements of BQ2 to open new dispensaries as granted in December of 2018. The plaintiffs shall now continue to trial on the merits of the pending litigation against the State of Nevada. In March of 2020, counsel for Red Earth withdrew from its representation of Red Earth. Red Earth is actively trying to retain substitute counsel, which as of the date of this filing Red Earth remains unrepresented in this matter. The trial, which was scheduled to commence in April of 2020, has been postponed by the State of Nevada as part of their implementation measures to stop the spread of COVID-19, as of the date of this filing the trial has not commenced.

The Company intends to continue to grow its business through the acquisition of existing companies and/or through the development of new opportunities and joint ventures that can maximize shareholder value while providing a 360-degree spectrum of infrastructure (dispensaries), cultivation, production, management, and consulting services in the regulated cannabis industry.
 
Marijuana Industry Overview
 
The Company currently operates a marijuana business in the State of Nevada. Although the possession, cultivation and distribution of marijuana is permitted in Nevada, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. The Company believes it operates its business in compliance with applicable state laws and regulations. Any changes in federal, state, or local law enforcement regarding marijuana may affect its ability to operate its business. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with its business plans, could expose the Company to potential criminal liability, and could subject its properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance, or other business services may also affect the Company’s ability to operate its business.
 
Marijuana cultivation refers to the planting, tending, improving and harvesting of the flowering plant Cannabis, primarily for the production and consumption of cannabis flowers, often referred to as “buds”. The cultivation techniques for marijuana cultivation differ than for other purposes such as hemp production. Generally, references to marijuana cultivation and production do not include hemp production.
 
Cannabis belongs to the genus Cannabis in the family Cannabaceae and for the purposes of production and consumption, includes three species, C. sativa (“Sativa”), C. Indica (“Indica”), and C. ruderalis (“Ruderalis”). Sativa and Indica generally grow tall with some varieties reaching approximately 4 meters. The female plants produce flowers rich in tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Ruderalis is a short plant and produces trace amounts of THC but is very rich in cannabidiol (“CBD”), which is an antagonist (inhibits the physiological action) to THC.
 
As of February 2022, there are a total of 38 states, plus the District of Columbia, with legislation passed as it relates to medicinal cannabis. These state laws are in direct conflict with the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (“CSA”), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, which is viewed as having a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted use for medical treatment in the U.S., and lacks acceptable safety for use under medical supervision. These 35 states, plus the District of Columbia, have adopted laws that exempt patients who use medicinal cannabis under a physician’s supervision from state criminal penalties. These are collectively referred to as the states that have de-criminalized medicinal cannabis, although there is a subtle difference between de-criminalization and legalization, and each state’s laws are different.
 
As of February 2022, 18 states and the District of Columbia now allow for the recreational use and possession of small amounts of marijuana and marijuana products. Decriminalization of marijuana varies by state. Decriminalization generally means that violators of local marijuana laws may be subject to civil penalty rather than face criminal prosecution. Fifteen states have decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana but have not legalized possession. In these states decriminalization can mean possession of as little as ten grams of marijuana up to one-hundred grams of marijuana that will not result in any criminal prosecution but may result in civil fines. In three states, Idaho, South Dakota, and Kansas, the cultivation, possession or use of marijuana is strictly prohibited and violators may be subject to criminal prosecution. In Nevada, where the Company is headquartered and has focused most of its activities, legalized marijuana for recreational use was effective as of July 1, 2017, which made it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to one ounce of marijuana flowers and one-eighth of an ounce of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, businesses can legally, pursuant to state regulations, cultivate, process, dispense, distribute, and test marijuana products under certain conditions.

The dichotomy between federal and state laws has limited the access to banking and other financial services by marijuana businesses. Recently the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the U.S. Department of Treasury issued guidance for banks considering conducting business with marijuana dispensaries in states where those businesses are legal, pursuant to which banks must now file a Marijuana Limited Suspicious Activity Report that states the marijuana business is following the government’s guidelines with regard to revenue that is generated exclusively from legal sales. However, since the same guidance noted that banks could still face prosecution if they provide financial services to marijuana businesses, it has led to the widespread refusal of the banking industry to offer banking services to marijuana businesses operating within state and local laws. In March of this year, U.S. Congressman Ed Perlmutter (D – Colorado) introduced house bill H.R. 1595, known as the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act to allow legally operating cannabis related businesses to utilize traditional banking services without fear of federal agencies taking legal action against the banks or their customers. The SAFE bill has strong bipartisan support in the House of Representatives and many industry observers anticipate it will be ratified within the next year.
 
The DOJ has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of marijuana for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address marijuana activity.
 
In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical marijuana and recreational marijuana in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to the Company’s business and its revenue and profits.
 
Furthermore, H.R. 83, known as the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment, is a rider to the annual appropriations bill that prohibits the DOJ from using federal funds to prevent certain states, including Nevada and California, from implementing their own laws that authorized the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana. This prohibition was in place until November 21, 2019.
 
The Company is monitoring the Biden administration’s, the DOJ’s, and Congress’ positions on federal marijuana law and policy. Based on public statements and reports, the Company understands that certain aspects of those laws and policies are currently under review, but no official changes have been announced. It is possible that certain changes to existing laws or policies could have a negative effect on its business and results of operations.
