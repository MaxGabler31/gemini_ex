Who We Are
 

 Alpine 4 is a publicly held enterprise with four principles at the core of its business: Synergy, Innovation, Drive, and Excellence (S.I.D.E.).  At Alpine 4, we believe synergistic innovation drives excellence. By anchoring these words to our combined experience and capabilities, we are able to aggressively pursue opportunities within and across vertical markets. We deliver solutions that not only drive industry standards, but also increase value for our shareholders.
 


 At Alpine 4, we understand the nature of how technology and innovation can accentuate a business. We strive to develop strategic synergies between our holdings to create value and operational excellence within a unique long-term perspective.
 
Our Strategy
 
Alpine 4's strategy is to provide Fortune 500-level execution strategies in its subsidiary companies and market segments to businesses and companies that have the most to benefit from this access.
 
Alpine 4 feels this opportunity exists in smaller middle market operating companies with revenues between $5 to $150 million.  In this target rich environment, businesses generally sell at more reasonable multiples, presenting greater opportunities for operational and strategic improvements and have greater potential for growth.   Implementation of our strategy within our holdings is accomplished by the offering of strategic and tactical MBA-level training and development, delivered via the following modules:

- | An Alpine 4 developed ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning system) and collaboration system called SPECTRUMebos. SPECTRUMebos is what we are defining as an Enterprise Business Operating System (ebos). This system will combine the key technology software components of Accounting and Financial Reporting, an Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP), a Document Management System (DMS), a Business Intelligence (BI) platform and a Customer Resource Management (CRM) hub which will be tethered to management reporting and collaboration toolsets. Management believes that these tools will help drive real-time information in two directions: first, to the front lines by empowering customer-facing stakeholders; and second, back to management for planning, problem solving, and integration. Management believes that SPECTRUMebos will be the technology "secret sauce" in managing our portfolio of companies and, in time, may be offered to external customers.

All great strategies must have trades offs. Therefore, Alpine 4 avoids companies that have unionized employees, businesses that have more than $150 million in revenue and companies that reside in highly regulated business industries.
 
Diversification
 
It is our goal to help drive Alpine 4 into a leading multi-faceted holding company with diverse products and services that not only benefit from one another as whole but also have the benefit of independence.  This type of corporate structure is about having our subsidiaries prosper through strong onsite leadership, while working synergistically with other Alpine 4 holdings.   Alpine 4 has been set up with a holding company model, with Presidents who will run each business, and Managers with specific industry related experience who, along with Kent Wilson, the CEO of Alpine 4, will help guide our portfolio of companies as needed.  Alpine 4 will work with our Presidents and Managers to ensure that our motto of S.I.D.E (Synergistic, Innovation, Drives, Excellence) is utilized.  Further, we plan to work with our subsidiaries and capital partners to provide the proper capital allocation and, to work to make sure each business is executing at high levels. 
 
In 2016, we saw the beginning of our plan for diversification take hold with the acquisition of Quality Circuit Assembly, Inc. ("QCA") when Alpine 4 acquired 100% of QCA's stock effective April 1, 2016.  Additional information relating to our acquisition of QCA can be found in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2016.
 
In October of 2016, Alpine 4 formed a new Limited Liability Company called ALTIA (Automotive Logic & Technology In Action) to create an independent subsidiary for Alpine 4's 6th Sense Auto product and its BrakeActive product.
 
Effective, January 1, 2017, Alpine 4 acquired 100% of Venture West Energy Services ("VWES") (formerly Horizon Well Testing, LLC). . Additional information about the acquisition of VWES can be found below under "Recent Developments" and in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 8, 2016, and January 13, 2017.

At the core of our business strategy is our focus on scalable corporate platform solutions.  We have built a strong portfolio of manufacturing, software, and energy driven businesses with a focus on long-term value creation.
