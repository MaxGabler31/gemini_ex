Regional Brands Inc. (“Regional Brands”, the “Company”, “we” “our” and “us”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1986 and subsequently became a holding company. Our corporate office is located at 6060 Parkland Boulevard, Cleveland, Ohio 44124 and our telephone number is (216) 825-4000. Our corporate website address is http://www.regionalbrandsinc.com.

Regional Brands Inc. is a holding company formed to acquire substantial ownership in regional companies with strong brand recognition, stable revenues and profitability. Regional Brands has been pursuing a business strategy whereby it seeks to engage in an acquisition, merger or other business combination transaction with undervalued businesses (each, a “Target Company”) with a history of operating revenues in markets that provide opportunities for growth. After the acquisition of the business of B.R. Johnson, Inc. (“BRJ Inc.”) by our majority-owned subsidiary, B.R. Johnson, LLC (“BRJ LLC”), we are currently focused on considering opportunities for growth of BRJ LLC through utilizing its balance sheet to provide capital for additional acquisitions of companies that would be complementary to BRJ LLC. Additionally, we may seek to acquire Target Companies that satisfy the following criteria: (1) established businesses with viable services or products; (2) an experienced and qualified management team; (3) opportunities for growth and/or expansion into other markets; (4) are accretive to earnings; (5) offer the opportunity to achieve and/or enhance profitability; and (6) increase shareholder value.
 
On November 1, 2016, our majority-owned subsidiary, BRJ LLC, acquired substantially all of the assets (the “Acquisition”) of BRJ Inc., a seller and distributor of windows, doors and related hardware as well as specialty products for use in commercial and residential buildings (the “Business”).
 
The Acquisition was consummated pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2016 (the “APA”). Total consideration for the Acquisition was approximately $16.5 million, including delivery by BRJ LLC of a promissory note for $2,500,000 to BRJ Inc. (the “Note”), which is subordinate to the Debt Agreements (as defined below) and working capital adjustments of approximately $1.1 million. We provided $10.95 million in debt and equity financing to complete the Acquisition, including $7.14 million of the Subordinated Loan (as defined below) and $3.81 million in preferred equity of BRJ LLC.
 
Concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition, BRJ LLC entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility to borrow up to $6,000,000 (the “Credit Facility”) pursuant to that certain Credit and Security Agreement, dated November 1, 2016 (the “Credit Agreement”), with the lenders named therein and KeyBank, N.A. as agent for such lenders. BRJ LLC also entered into that certain Loan and Security Agreement, dated November 1, 2016 (the “Loan Agreement and, together with the Credit Facility, the “Debt Agreements”), pursuant to which it received a $7,500,000 loan that is subordinate to the Credit Facility (the “Subordinated Loan”). To finance the Acquisition and potential future acquisitions, we issued 894,393 shares of our common stock for aggregate proceeds to us of $12,074,311 in a private placement (the “Private Placement”) with 93 accredited investors, pursuant to the terms of a Subscription Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2016 (the “Subscription Agreement”). The foregoing transactions are collectively hereinafter referred to as the “Transactions”.
 
Following the Acquisition, all of operations of the Business are conducted through our majority-owned subsidiary BRJ LLC.

Johnson, LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement (the “LLC Agreement”) entered into by and among Lorraine Capital, LLC (which owns 20% of the common membership interests), Regional Brands Inc. and BRJ Acquisition Partners, LLC (which owns the remaining 3.83% of the common membership interests and 4.78% of the preferred membership interests). Lorraine Capital, LLC and BRJ Acquisition Partners, LLC are collectively referred to as the “Lorraine Parties”.

Business Overview
 
B.R. Johnson, Inc. was founded by Benjamin “Ben” R. Johnson in 1928.  Some of the original products sold by BRJ Inc. were steel windows, rolling self-storing screens, kitchen cabinets, and Modernfold operable wall partitions, a product it still distributes principally in the Upstate New York market.  Over the course of the following decades, BRJ Inc. added commercial steel doors, hardware, and residential and commercial windows. We believe BRJ Inc. has built a reputation of only distributing products that are the best in their respective category. Product categories include:

· | Commercial doors and hardware;
--+-------------------------------


· | Commercial windows;
--+--------------------


· | Specialty division; consisting of operable partitions, movable glass walls, fire and smoke containment systems and gymnasium equipment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Residential windows;
--+---------------------


· | Residential hardware; and
--+--------------------------


· | Aftermarket door sales.
--+------------------------

Industry Overview
 
According to an industry study published by the international business research company, The Freedonia Group, the total United States window and door market (measured by sales at the manufacturers’ level) was estimated to be valued at approximately $34.3 billion in sales in 2021.
 
One key factor in driving our growth is the relative strength of new housing and renovation activity in our markets, including investment in new and replacement windows and doors. If construction spending in window and door intensive commercial segments expands, specifically office, retail, and lodging structures, we expect that would will also fuel sales of our products.
 
Regional variations in economic activity influence the level of demand for windows and door products across the United States. Of particular importance are regional differences in the level of construction and renovation activity. Demographic trends, including population growth and migration, contribute to the regional variations through their influence on regional new construction activity.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
We target customer groups and emphasize product categories where we believe we are well positioned in comparison to our competitors. These include aftermarket door service and installation; commercial window customers with demanding installation requirements; and products requiring proprietary know-how and installation skills.
 
Commercial door and hardware remains a highly competitive product category. Our strategy is to defend our market share so that our volume remains at sufficient levels to achieve the best pricing from our suppliers, thus enabling us to maintain acceptable profit margins in this segment.
 
Currently, we operate primarily in the Upstate New York market and we plan to expand our geographic reach through ongoing business development efforts by our Rochester, NY and recently opened Buffalo, NY sales offices.

Sales and Marketing
 
As a result of our longstanding and leading position in the Upstate New York market, we have developed relationships with owners, architects, and developers and, we believe, a reputation for providing products and services that best suit the customers’ needs, positioning us well in comparison to our competitors.
 
Our customer service team strives to respond to opportunities with our customers at an early stage and quote opportunities quickly with the best solution for our customers based on our access to multiple suppliers. We prioritize opportunities based on the competitive advantages we identify, often where customers’ needs involve a level of complexity.
 
We maintain an extensive inventory of commercial door and hardware items. This frequently allows us to react to smaller negotiated and non-bid sales opportunities quickly with product we have in stock. With larger projects, we seek to utilize manufacturer service centers to provide fabrication when possible to minimize pass-through in our facility.
 
Other sales and marketing activities include attending industry related trade shows, targeted engagement with social media, and search engine optimization for our website.
 
Customers
 
Our customers are varied and encompass building owners, building tenants (with long term property rights) and contractors who serve them. We have customers who place orders that we book and ship, such as in the commercial door and hardware category. These same customers may have large projects from time to time such as commercial window projects that take several months (occasionally over a year ) to complete. Commercial customers include: owners of educational buildings, K-12 school districts, private schools and public and private colleges and universities; owners of multi-family housing, including senior housing, both private and public; other building owners, including retail health care and institutional buildings, casinos and hotels; and energy performance contractors. Our residential windows, doors and door hardware customers are generally contractors or developers serving the Upstate New York market.

Strategic Alliances
 
We view Lorraine Capital, LLC, and Ancora Advisors, LLC (“Ancora”), as strategic sources for identifying opportunities for new business in Western New York and Northeast Ohio. We also believe that Lorraine Capital, LLC and Ancora can assist us with sourcing capital to meet funding that may be needed for our expansion or take advantage of consolidation opportunities with competitors through acquisitions. In addition, we have a relationship with a union qualified commercial window subcontractor, Airways Door Service, Inc. (“ADSI”), which is advantageous to us in situations that require union installation labor. Individuals affiliated with Lorraine Capital, LLC acquired 57% of ADSI’s common stock in connection with the Acquisition.
Competition
 
Our products are sold under highly competitive conditions. Currently, we operate principally in the Upstate New York market and we compete with a number of companies, some of which have greater financial resources than us. The principal competitive factors in the markets we serve include price, product quality, delivery and the ability to customize to customer specifications. We encounter different competitive environments in each of our product categories. In some of the product categories, there are fewer competitors, in part due to the reduction of new entrants to the market. In addition, many of our suppliers find it economical to have a limited number of vendors in any geographic area. In the residential market segment, we face intense competition from big-box stores, large independent chains and online retailers where we seek to differentiate our products and services with high-end quality products that meet the specialized installation requirements of our customers. In addition, certain product manufacturers sell and distribute their products directly to customers or enter into exclusive supply arrangements with other distributors.
Suppliers
 
We operate as a multi-line product distributor and installer across the entire Upstate New York region for nationally and internationally recognized industry leading brands. Our ability to offer a wide variety of products to our customers is dependent upon our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing, as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner. Generally, our products are obtainable from various sources and in sufficient quantities.
Employees
 
BRJ LLC employed 96 people full-time and 1 person part-time as of March 1, 2019. Regional Brands has no employees other than its Chief Executive Officer.
