 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 TimkenSteel Corporation ("we", "us", "our", the "Company" or "TimkenSteel") was incorporated in Ohio on October 24, 2013, and became an independent, publicly traded company as the result of a spinoff from The Timken Company ("Timken") on June 30, 2014. In the spinoff, Timken transferred to us all of the assets and generally all of the liabilities related to Timken’s steel business.
 We manufacture alloy steel, as well as carbon and micro-alloy steel. Our portfolio includes special bar quality ("SBQ") bars, seamless mechanical tubing ("tubes"), manufactured components (formerly known as the "value-add" product type) such as precision steel components, and billets. In addition, we supply machining and thermal treatment services, and we manage raw material recycling programs, which are also used as a feeder system for our melt operations. Our products and services are used in a diverse range of demanding applications in the following market sectors: automotive; oil and gas; industrial equipment; mining; construction; rail; defense; heavy truck; agriculture; power generation; and oil country tubular goods ("OCTG").
 SBQ steel is made to restrictive chemical compositions and high internal purity levels and is used in critical mechanical applications. We make these products from nearly 100% recycled steel, using our expertise in raw materials to create custom steel products. We focus on creating tailored products and services for our customers’ most demanding applications. Our engineers are experts in both materials and applications, so we can work closely with each customer to deliver flexible solutions related to our products as well as to their applications and supply chains.
 The SBQ bar, tube, and billet production processes take place at our Canton, Ohio manufacturing location. This location accounts for all of the SBQ bars, seamless mechanical tubes and billets we produce and includes three manufacturing facilities: the Faircrest, Harrison and Gambrinus facilities. Our production of manufactured components takes place at two downstream manufacturing facilities: Tryon Peak (Columbus, North Carolina) and St. Clair (Eaton, Ohio). Many of the production processes are integrated, and the manufacturing facilities produce products that are sold in all of our market sectors. As a result, investments in our facilities and resource allocation decisions affecting our operations are designed to benefit the overall business, not any specific aspect of the business.
 On February 16, 2021, management announced a plan to indefinitely idle our Harrison melt and casting assets, which was completed in the first quarter of 2021. All of our melt and casting activities now take place at the Faircrest location. We worked collaboratively with employees, suppliers and a number of customers to ensure a well-organized and efficient transition. Our rolling and finishing operations at Harrison were not impacted by this action. For additional details regarding this matter please refer to “Note 6 – Disposition of Non-Core Assets.”
 Prior to indefinitely idling these assets, we had an annual melt capacity of approximately 2 million tons and shipment capacity of 1.5 million tons. After indefinitely idling these assets, our annual melt capacity is approximately 1.2 million tons and our shipment capacity is approximately 0.9 million tons.
 Operating Segments
 We conduct our business activities and report financial results as one business segment. The presentation of financial results as one reportable segment is consistent with the way we operate our business and is consistent with the manner in which the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") evaluates performance and makes resource and operating decisions for the business as described above. Furthermore, the Company notes that monitoring financial results as one reportable segment helps the CODM manage costs on a consolidated basis, consistent with the integrated nature of our operations.
Industry Segments and Geographical Financial Information
 Information required by this Item is incorporated herein by reference to “Note 3 - Segment Information” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Strengths and Strategy
 Our customers depend on us to be the leader in solving their industries’ constantly evolving challenges. Our team, including engineers and experienced manufacturing professionals in both materials and applications, works closely with customers to deliver flexible solutions related to our products as well as our customers’ applications and supply chains.


The TimkenSteel business model delivers these tailored solutions based on the following foundation:
 •Experienced management and technical team.
 •Close and trusted working relationship with customers across diverse market sectors.
 •Leadership position in niche markets with differentiated products.
 •Track record of innovation rooted in a deep technical knowledge of steel materials, manufacturing processes and a focus on end-user applications.
 Major Customers
 We sell products and services that are used in a range of demanding applications around the world. We have over 350 diverse customers in the following market sectors: automotive; oil and gas; industrial equipment; mining; construction; rail; defense; heavy truck; agriculture; power generation; and OCTG.
Products
 We believe we produce some of the cleanest, highest performing alloy air-melted steels in the world for our customers’ most demanding applications. We leverage our technical knowledge, development expertise and production and engineering capabilities across all of our products and market sectors to deliver high-performance products to our customers.
 SBQ Steel Bar, Seamless Mechanical Steel Tubes, and Billets. Our focus is on alloy steel, although in total we manufacture more than 400 grades of high-performance carbon, micro-alloy and alloy steel, sold as ingots, bars, tubes and billets. These products are custom-made in a variety of chemistries, lengths and finishes. Our metallurgical expertise and what we believe to be unique operational capabilities drive high-value solutions for industrial, energy and mobile customers. Our specialty steels are featured in a wide variety of end products including: gears; hubs; axles; crankshafts and connecting rods; oil country drill pipe; bits and collars; bearing races and rolling elements; bushings; fuel injectors; wind energy shafts; anti-friction bearings; and other demanding applications where mechanical power transmission is critical to the end customer.
 Manufactured Components. In addition to our customized steels, we also custom-make precision components that provide us with the opportunity to further expand our market for bar and tube products and capture additional sales. These products provide customers, especially those in the mobile end-market sector, with ready-to-finish components that simplify vendor management, streamline supply chains and often cost less than other alternatives. We also customize products and services for the industrial and energy end-market sectors.
Sales and Distribution
 Our sales force is made up largely of engineers that are backed by a team of metallurgists and other technical experts. While most of our products are sold directly to original equipment ("OE") manufacturers, a portion of our sales are made through authorized distributors and steel service centers, representing approximately 22% of net sales during 2021. The majority of our customers are served through individually negotiated price agreements.
Competition
 The steel industry, both domestically and globally, is highly competitive and is expected to remain so. Maintaining high standards of product quality and reliability, while keeping production costs competitive, is essential to our ability to compete with domestic and foreign manufacturers of alloy steel and mechanical components. For bar products less than 6-inch in diameter, principal competitors include foreign-owned domestic producers Gerdau Special Steel North America (a unit of Brazilian steelmaker Gerdau, S.A) and Republic Steel (a unit of Mexican steel producer ICH). For bar products up to 9-inch in diameter, domestic producers Steel Dynamics, Inc. and Nucor Corporation (in some cases up to 10-inch) are our principal competitors. For very large bars from 10 to 16 inches in diameter, offshore producers as well as specialty forging companies in North America such as Scot Forge are the primary competitors. For seamless mechanical tubing, offshore producers such as Tenaris, S.A., Vallourec, S.A. and TMK Group are our primary competitors as well as the foreign-owned domestic producer ArcelorMittal Tubular Products (a unit of Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal, S.A.). We also provide unique manufactured steel products and supply chain solutions to our customers in the mobile, industrial and energy end-market sectors. Manufactured component competitors include both integrated and non-integrated component producers.
Lead Time
 The lead time for our products varies based on product type and specifications. As of the date of this filing, lead times for SBQ bars and tubes extend into the third quarter of 2022.
Raw Materials
 The principal raw materials that we use to manufacture steel are recycled scrap metal, chrome, nickel, molybdenum oxide, vanadium and other alloy materials. Raw materials comprise a significant portion of the steelmaking cost structure and are subject to price and availability changes due to global demand fluctuations and local supply limitations. Proper selection and management of raw materials can have a significant impact on procurement cost, flexibility to supply changes, steelmaking energy costs and mill productivity. In addition to accessing scrap and alloys through the open market, we have established a scrap return supply chain with many of our customers. This part of our business leverages our knowledge of the raw material supply industry and an extensive network of relationships that result in steady, reliable supply from our raw material sources.
Research and Development
 Our engineers analyze customer application challenges and develop solutions to address the customers’ needs. With a century of experience in materials science and steelmaking, we leverage our technical know-how to improve the performance of our customers’ products and supply chains.
 This expertise extends to advanced process technology in which material conversion, finishing, gaging and assembly enables high quality production of our products. With resources dedicated to studying, developing and implementing new manufacturing processes and technologies, we are able to support our customers’ requirements.
 Our research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $1.7 million, $1.8 million and $4.1 million, respectively.
 Environmental Matters and Governmental Regulations
 We consider compliance with environmental regulations and environmental sustainability a key strategic focus area and integral to our responsibility as a good corporate citizen. All our domestic steel making and processing operations, and our water treatment plant, have obtained and maintain ISO 14001 certification.
 We believe we have established appropriate reserves to cover our environmental expenses. We have a well-established environmental compliance audit program that measures performance against applicable laws as well as against internal standards that have been established for all facilities. It is difficult to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements that differ from existing ones both domestically and internationally.
 
We have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the Clean Air Act ("CAA"), Clean Water Act ("CWA"), Toxic Substances Control Act ("TSCA"), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), as well as other laws.
 
We continue to monitor regulations relevant to our Company to ensure we remain compliant. This includes, but is not limited to, regulations such as the CAA, CWA, TSCA, and the RCRA.

Additionally, we continue to monitor any future carbon regulation. On February 19, 2021, the U.S. rejoined the Paris Agreement, which includes pledging to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions. To date, the U.S. Congress has not legislated carbon constraints on businesses.
 From time to time, we may be a party to lawsuits, claims or other proceedings related to environmental matters and/or receive notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the EPA and similar state or local authorities. We recorded reserves for such environmental matters of $0.2 million as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020. Accruals related to such environmental matters represent management’s best estimate of the fees and costs associated with these matters. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of such matters, management believes the ultimate disposition of these matters should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 Legal Proceedings
 Information required by this section is incorporated herein by reference to “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.”
 Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 While we own a number of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, licenses and copyrights, none are material to our products and production processes.


Governance and Environmental Stewardship
 TimkenSteel is committed to promoting the long-term interests of shareholders and building public trust through good governance practices. We are committed to operating in accordance with the highest standards of ethics and integrity, and maintaining robust programs focused on compliance. We regularly review, and update when necessary, the charters for our Board committees, director selection criteria and procedures, board composition criteria, and various policies and procedures designed to ensure effective and responsive governance.
 
The TimkenSteel Code of Conduct sets forth policies covering a broad range of subjects, including antitrust and competition, corruption and bribery, conflicts of interest, inside information, accurate financial records, and requires strict adherence to laws and regulations applicable to the Company’s business. In accordance with our Supplier Code of Conduct, we seek to work with suppliers that share our core values.
 
Our commitment to environmental stewardship encompasses how we continuously seek to improve the efficiency and cleanliness of our electric arc furnace ("EAF") operations while delivering quality projects and services that help our customers compete. We employ proactive environmental practices that focus on maintaining clean air, water and land, and comply with environmental rules and regulations. Innovation, collaboration and stakeholder engagement are embedded within our environmental programs.
 
In October 2021, TimkenSteel announced environmental goals for 2030. The Company has established the following 2030 environmental goals, compared with a 2018 baseline:
 •40% absolute reduction in combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions 
 •30% absolute reduction in total energy consumption (direct and indirect) 
 •35% absolute reduction in fresh water withdrawn 
 •10% reduction in waste-to-landfill intensity 
 
The Company’s 2030 targets for greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption and fresh water withdrawn are based on an absolute or total reduction in the amount of greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption and fresh water withdrawn. In contrast, the Company’s waste-to-landfill target is based on an intensity or percentage reduction of waste-to-landfill per ton of steel shipped. All 2030 targets are based on the Company’s operating assets as of 2018 and do not account for any future inorganic growth or other expansion of its facilities or operating assets, for which an adjustment to the absolute reduction may be required. The Company selected 2018 as the baseline year as it aligns with the baseline used in the Company’s Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) disclosure.
 
During 2021, we did not have significant spend on capital expenditures related to environmental, social, and governance ("ESG") projects. Beginning in 2022, we have allocated approximately $3 million of capital expenditures per year through 2030 to achieve our long-term ESG goals.

Human Capital
 Employment
 At December 31, 2021, we had approximately 1,850 employees, with approximately 63% of our employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement.
 On October 29, 2021, the United Steelworkers ("USW") Local 1123 voted to ratify a new four-year contract (the “Contract”). The Contract, which is in effect until September 27, 2025, offers TimkenSteel's Canton-based bargaining employees an increase to base wages every year, competitive healthcare and retirement benefits for all members, and has a continued focus on employee wellbeing as well as safe and sustainable operations. The Contract covers approximately 1,170 bargaining employees at the Company’s Canton, Ohio operations.
 Health and safety
 At TimkenSteel, operating safely and responsibly remains a critical priority. We have rigorous safety policies and practices, which are supported by education, training, evaluation and enforcement, in an effort to ensure that our workspaces provide a secure environment for our employees. To reinforce the importance of operating safely and responsibly, a safety modifier is included in our annual incentive compensation plan for salaried employees. The safety modifier is applied to the total calculated payout, resulting in a five percent increase or decrease against the payout calculation depending on whether the target safety metrics are achieved. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the target safety metrics were not achieved, resulting in the application of a five percent decrease against the total payout calculation.


Diversity and inclusion
 Our commitment to diverse perspectives fuels our success and has enabled us to deliver innovate solutions throughout the life of our business. We recognize that a diverse workforce and inclusive, engaging culture is key to our continued business success. Within our organization, we maintain employee resource groups which further promote diversity and inclusion. TimkenSteel is also proudly involved in several organizations that promote and foster diversity and inclusion in our community and industry.
 Compensation and total rewards
 We provide competitive compensation programs to help meet the needs of our employees. Our programs are designed to support the profitable growth of our business; attract, reward, and retain the talent we need to succeed; support the health and overall well-being of our employees; and reinforce a performance-based culture.
In addition to base compensation, we offer quarterly and annual incentive compensation, stock awards, and participation in various retirement plans. Furthermore, our Company also provides employer-sponsored health and wellness benefits to our employees.
 Employee retention
 We seek to retain the best people by providing them with opportunities to grow, build skills and be appreciated for their contributions as they work to serve our customers. Our employees are critical to our success and are the reason we are able to execute at a high level. We believe a continuous focus on employee engagement will help us provide high quality products to our customers.
 We diligently track our employee retention and management regularly evaluates our employees’ retention risk. For several years, the Company has aimed to maintain a voluntary turnover rate of 8% or less. For 2021, primarily as the result of a competitive labor market, we ended the year with a voluntary turnover rate of approximately 9%.
 Employee training and development
 We invest significant resources to develop talent with the right capabilities to deliver the growth and innovation needed to support our business strategy. We have designed curated training programs for employees at all levels in our SAP SuccessFactors learning software. For new managers, we have developed a rigorous training program to provide them with the resources needed to cultivate their skillset and aid them in becoming effective leaders in our business. TimkenSteel encourages our employees to constantly learn and grow and has aligned our performance management system to support this focus on continuous learning and development.
 COVID-19 pandemic
 At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, TimkenSteel was considered an "essential business" and therefore, we have continued to be fully operational and serving our customers while strictly following all public health directives to ensure the safety of our employees.
Our cross-functional pandemic response team continues to oversee and coordinate the Company’s overall response. The Company is committed to timely communications with our employees and their families as well as customers, suppliers and other key stakeholders of TimkenSteel.
 We continue to take several necessary actions to keep our workforce safe. While onsite, employees follow strict safe workplace practices including guidelines established by federal, state and local authorities for the areas in which we operate. We continue to use enhanced cleaning procedures in all plants and offices using the best practices provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC"). It is strongly encouraged that employees be vigilant with their personal hygiene and workplace hygiene and we regularly communicate the requirement for wearing of masks and that no one should come to work sick. To help reinforce these safety measures, we work closely with the USW. The Company also utilizes its onsite medical clinic - operated by a local health system - to provide additional support to its employees during the crisis. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, TimkenSteel has performed hundreds of audits in its plants to ensure its employees remain diligent in these efforts.
