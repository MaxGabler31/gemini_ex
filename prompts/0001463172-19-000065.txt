Item 1. Business.
Overview
We believe we’re living in a time of radical change in customer expectations that requires organizations to change the way they do business and serve their customers. Customers are moving faster, are more informed, and are more empowered than ever before. The organizations they do business with are under pressure to adapt and transform their customer experiences to keep up with these changes. Businesses can stand out from their competitors and gain an advantage by delivering the best customer experiences across their organization.
The Zendesk product family and platform is purpose-built to help companies deliver the best customer experiences and adapt to changing customer expectations. It unifies customer communication and customer data across disparate channels and departments, and simplifies the process of providing great omnichannel customer service and engagement across self service, phone calls, live chat, messaging, and email.
Zendesk’s open and flexible customer relationship management (“CRM”) platform, Zendesk Sunshine, is built on the public cloud and open standards, enabling rapid innovation for our customers and enhancing our product family. We have evolved from our origins in customer service to increasingly help even the largest organizations understand their customers, and to introduce products and a CRM platform that impact customer experiences and engagement broadly within organizations.
We are a software development company founded in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2007. We reincorporated in Delaware in 2009. Our principal executive offices are located at 1019 Market Street, San Francisco, California 94103, and our telephone number is (415) 418-7506. Our website address is www.zendesk.com.

Unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms “Zendesk,” “company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to Zendesk, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.
The Zendesk Approach
We build software that helps companies deliver better customer experiences, and we believe in an approach to both product design and delivery that is unified, unique, and innovative. As software becomes more central to the customer experience, we strive to design products that are proactive, contextual, and integrated by design. We believe in developing products that serve organizations of all sizes and across all industries. Our focus on these core principles has led us to design a product family and platform that share the following characteristics:

• | A unified omnichannel experience: Through our innovative products, we seek to be channel agnostic, allowing even some of the largest organizations to transform how they engage with customers regardless of how and when those customers want to communicate. As we expand the reach of our technology, we recognize the critical importance of having our products work cohesively together. All of our products share a common interface and we are continuing to invest in supporting our product family on a shared services platform.


• | Easy to use and implement: We build our products first and foremost for the people that use them everyday. We focus relentlessly on making the user experience intuitive and product implementation fast while managing complex processes and interactions on the backend of our software. Because of our attention to ease of use, we believe business users are more effective and efficient, and are able to deliver better experiences to their customers as a result.


• | Open and flexible platform: We believe that the establishment of open and public cloud computing has fundamentally changed how companies can and will build their customer experiences. Sunshine is a flexible CRM platform that leverages public cloud technologies and open standards. This platform enables organizations to connect and integrate customer data generated through the Zendesk product family with other business applications to build highly specialized workflows and customer experiences. Sunshine enables organizations to get a more complete picture of the customer so they can build more personalized experiences and adapt to evolving customer expectations.


• | Expanding access to analytics and data science: We are committed to enabling all sizes of organizations to better understand their customers through powerful analytics that unify data across our product family and platform and

4

connect easily to outside data sources. We believe our investments in building machine learning and artificial intelligence into the fabric of our products gives more organizations and users access to harness the power of data science so they can be more efficient, informed, and proactive with their customers.
We have witnessed business software undergo a sweeping shift toward consumerization over the past decade. Zendesk has embraced this shift with an approach to delivering a family of products and CRM platform that is dramatically different from earlier generations of business software. Our goal is to remove barriers that make business software difficult to buy, deploy, and use. Our approach to software delivery focuses on the following key elements:

• | Elastic and agile: Our software products can easily grow and scale with our customers, and be used in new departments and use cases without the expensive deployment projects required in the past. Zendesk products are flexible by design and easy to configure and use. In addition to our family of products, we enable our customers through Sunshine, which gives customers the freedom to build customer applications and experiences using open tools and cloud architecture, instead of proprietary tools and technology.


• | Trial experience: We believe customers should be able to try our products before they commit to a purchase. Our free trials are core to the marketing of all of our products. They offer our small and large customers alike with access to the same fully functioning product experience as paying customers and the ability to begin a complete implementation during the evaluation period.


• | Price Transparency: We provide our customers a well-defined total cost of ownership across our family of products by providing transparent and predictable pricing. Our product pricing is designed to make our software accessible to customers of all sizes by offering a variety of subscription packages that include features based on customer need. We offer subscriptions that may be purchased online and deployed without the need to engage a sales or enablement professional.

Growth Strategy
Zendesk was founded with a mission to help organizations build better relationships with their customers. We have continued to pursue that mission by building and delivering a family of customer experience software products and a CRM platform that help companies be the company their customers want them to be. We believe our future growth will be a natural extension of our mission, and we are focused on the following key growth drivers:

• | Expanding our market by maturing our family of products and CRM platform: From our founding of providing customer support software, we have evolved to helping businesses design, build, and manage their entire customer experience infrastructure and transform how they interact and engage with their customers. Our family of products has expanded to serve the customer journey from sales, to support, to customer success, and proactive engagement. We will continue to mature our products’ features and seamless usability across communication channels, while also integrating and expanding our products across CRM functions.

With Zendesk Sunshine, we provide organizations the ability to unify and use data for a more complete picture of their customer and also give their developers the ability to build and deploy customer apps and services faster in the public cloud. We will continue to expand the capabilities of our platform and its integration with our products. Additionally, we will continue our investments in building machine learning and artificial intelligence into the fabric of our products and platform, empowering organizations to harness the power of data science and be more efficient, informed, and proactive with their customers.

• | Being strategic partners with our customers who are larger organizations: With our family of customer experience software products and CRM platform, we are increasingly evolving from a software vendor to a trusted partner that is strategically engaging with our customers around their visions and digital transformations. We are helping companies build or transform their companies around their customer experience. We are scaling these capabilities by continuing to build and mature our expertise in enterprise sales, success, relationships, systems architecture, and integrations. Additionally, we are continuing to develop a partner ecosystem strategy to help us reach and serve more enterprise customers and build a community of developer evangelists for our CRM platform.

5


• | Making experiences simple for organizations and their customers: At our core, we believe that customer experiences should be simple and effortless. This belief has enabled us to build a compelling brand and leadership position among both small-to-medium sized organizations and larger enterprises for which our ease of use, quick return on investment, and flexible pricing are important differentiators. Our products and platform provide simple solutions and interfaces across the customer journey and multiple communication channels, for both agents providing service and for customers interacting with businesses. Additionally, we have been built on the premise that our products should be easy to discover, deploy, and purchase so that any organization, from startup to large enterprise, can realize their value.

Our principle of democratizing software has developed into a highly efficient business model represented by expansion within customer accounts and organic growth through promotion by our customers. We will continue our focus on providing a beautifully simple family of products and CRM platform that create simple and effortless experiences for both the end customer and the agent.
With our solutions, Zendesk has always served a global market and, for the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated 48% of our revenue outside of the United States. We have customers in more than 160 countries and territories, and products available in more than 30 languages. We will continue to expand our global footprint, particularly in those markets where we have demonstrated significant customer traction with our democratized approach or which represent particularly strategic opportunities.
Zendesk Products
Zendesk’s products are built to help companies address the rise in customer expectations and to craft their customer experiences into a competitive differentiator. Zendesk products share a common interface and are being developed to support a shared services infrastructure and common customer data platform. Zendesk’s products are developed using agile software techniques, and are designed to quickly incorporate and innovate on customer feedback obtained through extensive Early Access Programs, or EAPs. This approach allows us to share our newest technology with customers, and quickly adapt our products to address customer needs.
Zendesk offers products that are used throughout the customer lifecycle by customer support, marketing, sales, customer success, mobile and application development teams, and more.
The Zendesk family of products includes the following:

• | Zendesk Support, our flagship product, is a beautifully simple system for tracking, prioritizing, and solving customer support tickets across multiple channels, bringing customer information and interactions into one place.


• | Zendesk Chat is live chat software that provides a fast and responsive way to connect with customers in the moment, on websites, in applications, on mobile devices, and through their favorite messaging apps.


• | Zendesk Talk is cloud-based call center software for more personal and productive phone and SMS support conversations and enables organizations to provide phone support from the same platform they use to manage all other support channels.


• | Zendesk Guide is a knowledge base that powers both customer self-service and support agent productivity through content that is created and organized by companies. Guide content is available via self-service website, accessible through APIs on websites, in apps and mobile devices, and surfaced to agents within Support and Chat. Additionally, Answer Bot is a feature within Guide that uses machine learning to automatically answer customers’ questions by suggesting content from the Guide knowledge base.


• | Zendesk Explore provides analytics for businesses to measure and improve the entire customer experience, with instant access to the customer analytics that matter—and the deeper understanding of customers and business that comes with it.


• | Zendesk Sell is sales force automation software to enhance productivity, processes, and pipeline visibility for sales teams. Sell is simple and designed to keep sales representatives selling. Sell eliminates the friction from deal updates so representatives and management are always able to access, analyze, and collaborate on relevant deal data.

• | Zendesk Connect manages proactive customer communication across channels, to deliver better customer experiences at scale. Zendesk Connect leverages that information in order to design the journey that’s right for each customer.

For customer support teams, The Zendesk Suite is a pre-configured and pre-packaged bundle of our Support, Chat, Guide and Talk products, offering everything companies need to let customer conversations flow more seamlessly across channels, creating a better experience for both businesses and their customers.
Zendesk’s platform and developer tools allow organizations to extend the functionality of our family of products, integrate into internal and third-party systems, and customize the experience for their employees and customers. Key components include:

• | Zendesk Sunshine, our open and flexible CRM platform, allows organizations to address an increasingly broader set of customer experiences. Sunshine provides organizations with the ability to develop a more complete picture of their customer with a flexible database and the ability to model, store and manage customer profiles, events, objects and relationships. Organizations can connect and integrate this data across the Zendesk product family with other business applications to build highly specialized workflow and unique customer experiences.


• | Zendesk Embeddables, a combination of our application programming interfaces, or APIs, Web Widget, and Mobile software developer’s kits, or SDKs, allow developers to embed Support, Chat, and Guide experiences natively on the web and within mobile applications.


• | Zendesk APIs are extensible and built on open standards, allowing users to build custom integrations and interact with Zendesk data using over 400 different API endpoints.


• | Zendesk Apps enable organizations to customize Zendesk product interfaces and optimize workflow through powerful plug-ins. Our customers can build custom apps or select from hundreds of pre-built apps on the Zendesk Marketplace.

Technology
We employ a modern technology architecture in which our products are built upon a set of core APIs that enable rapid innovation and deep integration. The technology infrastructure used for the Zendesk family of products is designed to provide a highly available and scalable cloud-based platform with industry-standard security measures.
Zendesk’s strategy is to leverage the open and public cloud both in hosting our applications and building Sunshine as a development platform. We believe this provides Zendesk and our customers with greater reliability, performance, and flexibility than operating through proprietary platforms and self-managed data centers.
The architecture and deployment of our software are described and guided by the following key characteristics:

• | Reliability. Our customers are highly dependent on our products, which are designed to be available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. We provide transparency to customers on availability and technical operations matters that impact them through our website and other channels.


• | Scalability. Our data infrastructure is highly scalable and regularly processes more than 100 million data driven requests that require the processing of specific data, on a daily basis.


• | Security. Each of our products are designed to host a large quantity of customer data. We maintain a comprehensive security program designed to help safeguard the security and integrity of our customers’ data. We regularly review our security program. In addition, we regularly obtain third-party security audits and examinations of our technical operations and practices covering data security.

Customers
As of December 31, 2018, we had an aggregate of approximately 136,600 paid customer accounts using our family of products. This includes approximately 73,600 customer accounts for paid subscription plans for Zendesk Support (other than our legacy Starter plan) and approximately 46,100 customer accounts for paid subscription plans of Zendesk Chat. In addition, we had approximately 16,900 paid customer accounts on our other products, collectively, as of December 31, 2018. Prior to 
7

purchase, we generally provide our prospective customers with the opportunity to try fully-functioning versions of our products for a free trial period. This is a central part of our business model as we believe customers should have the right to try products before being locked-into a subscription. Providing our customers with a free trial period exposes customers to our brand and establishes a relationship that can facilitate further adoption of our products as organizations grow in size and their needs become more complex. For further details as to how we calculate our number of paid customer accounts, please see the discussion in the "Key Business Metrics" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our customers are located in over 160 countries and territories and represent organizations across a broad array of sizes, industries, and geographies.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the development, design, and testing of all aspects of our products. We invest heavily in these efforts to continuously improve and innovate. In addition to our hosted software solution, and platform, we have developed multi-functional APIs that we utilize to build our products as well as facilitate integrations of our products with third-party applications.
Our global research and development team is primarily based in San Francisco, California; Copenhagen, Denmark; Melbourne, Australia; Dublin, Ireland; Singapore; Montpellier, France; Metro Manila, Philippines; and Krakow, Poland. To foster rapid innovation, our research and development team is further apportioned into smaller, agile development teams.
We deploy new features, functionality, and technologies across our products through frequent software releases or updates in order to minimize disruption and provide for constant improvement.
To create a product roadmap that meets our customers’ needs, we emphasize collaboration during the development process. Customers provide input through feedback forums, dialogue with our product support and research and development teams, and feature utilization. As a result of using our products internally to support our customers, we also develop new or improved features based on our own employees’ feedback.
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 730 employees in our research and development organization. Our research and development expenses were $160.3 million, $115.3 million, and $91.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Sales and Marketing
Subscriptions to our products are designed to be easy to purchase. A substantial number of our customers subscribe to our products with limited or no direct interaction with our sales team.
We also deploy a direct sales approach, which includes a sales team based in four regional hubs: North America, LATAM (Latin America), EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), and APAC (Asia-Pacific). This team manages prospective and current customers, aiming to initiate, retain, and expand their use of our family of products over time, and is responsible for driving expansions and renewals of existing contracts. Our sales team also partners with sales and product engineers to provide pre-sales technical support to prospective customers.
We expect to continue increasing penetration into larger organizations through a land and expand strategy whereby we attempt to capitalize on the use of our products by a functional or geographic department to expand the use of our products throughout the organization. Through our sales team, we also seek to discover and work with a growing number of forward-thinking enterprises on larger initiatives to transform their approach to customer experience.
We also utilize indirect sales channels, including referral partners and resellers, as well as implementation partners. These channel partners provide additional sales coverage, particularly in geographic markets where we may have limited presence, as well as implementation services to our customers. Sales from indirect channels have not been significant to date, but we plan to continue investing in these relationships to help us in certain markets and to complement our direct sales efforts.
Our marketing efforts are focused on generating awareness of our products, creating sales leads, nurturing prospective customers through the process of product discovery and evaluation, establishing and promoting our brand, and cultivating a community of successful and vocal customers. Based on our belief that the best method to sell subscriptions to our products is to provide customers with the opportunity to actively use and explore our products’ capabilities, one focus of our marketing team is to drive and encourage free trials and the successful conversion of free trials to paid subscriptions. We utilize both 
8

online and offline marketing initiatives, including search engine and email marketing, display and video advertising, blogs, corporate communications, whitepapers, case studies, user events, conferences, and webinars.
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 920 employees in our sales and marketing organizations. Our sales and marketing expenses were $291.7 million, $211.9 million, and $161.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Product Support, Customer Success, and Professional Services
We strive to exemplify the great customer service that organizations of all sizes can provide with our products by offering multi-channel service from our product support team, a rich self-help knowledge base with detailed product guides, and active community forums for agents, managers, and developers.
We offer different levels of product support based upon the subscription plans purchased by our customers. Regardless of the plan purchased, our products provide a unified intuitive interface, connectivity to our self-help knowledge base and community forums, and step-by-step tutorials to help users learn, use, and deploy our products effectively.
We additionally offer a variety of customer success initiatives aimed to address customer needs with varying levels of complexity, from our small business customers to even our largest enterprise customers. These initiatives are designed to ensure that our customers are best equipped to meet their business goals and to realize the full value of the implementation of our products.
Along with our global partners, our professional services team assists our customers in implementing more complex deployments of our products. These services include mapping our products to new and existing business processes, data migration, and integration with existing systems. Service engagements are typically scoped on a time and materials or project milestone basis and billed separately from the subscription to our products.
Through our training platform, we offer courses to help our customers quickly learn how to effectively use our products as well as implement best practices. Courses are available online, in-person at events, and, as requested by certain customers, on-site. Our training sessions are typically targeted at specific levels of employee seniority and product experience, such as agent essentials or administrator expert, to more effectively tailor training to intended audiences.
Seasonality
Historically, we have experienced the highest demand for our products and services in our fourth quarter, which we believe is a result of industry buying patterns. For a more detailed discussion of the seasonality impacting our business, see the “Seasonality” discussion in the "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
There are a number of established and emerging competitors in the broad market of customer engagement software. This market is fragmented, rapidly evolving, and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry in some segments. We consider the principal competitive differentiators in our market to include:

• | Ease-of-deployment and use;


• | Time to value realization;


• | Enablement of customer communications across channels;


• | Availability of self-service options;


• | Data analytics and performance recommendations;


• | Mobile and multi-device capabilities;


• | Proactive outreach tools;


• | Customization and integration with third-party applications;


• | Brand recognition and thought leadership; and

9


• | Total cost of ownership for the customer (including software updates, ongoing maintenance, and consulting and system integration fees).

While we believe that we successfully compete with respect to these dynamics, given the large number, disparate sizes, and varying areas of focus of other companies with which we compete in the provision of customer engagement software, we may not always compare favorably with respect to some or all of the foregoing factors.
For small to medium-sized organizations, we often compete with general use computer applications and other tools that organizations have adapted for managing relationships with their customers, including shared accounts for email communication, phone banks for voice communication, and pen and paper, text editors, and spreadsheets for tracking and management. For larger organizations, we compete with custom software systems and large enterprise software vendors, including salesforce.com, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, and ServiceNow, Inc., each of which may have greater operational flexibility to bundle competing products and services with other software offerings, or offer them at a lower price than our current Suite offering, which will negatively affect our competitiveness for that offering. In addition, we compete with a number of other SaaS providers with focused applications competitive to one or more of our products. Pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses, or the failure of our family of products to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business.
In order to maintain and improve our competitive position in the market, we remain focused in our development, operations, and sales and marketing efforts on the evolving customer service needs of all organizations.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, a variety of contractual arrangements, such as license agreements, assignment agreements, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality procedures and technical measures to gain rights to and protect the intellectual property used in our business. 
We have developed a patent program, and a strategy to identify, apply for, and secure patents for innovative aspects of our platform and technology. We have three issued U.S. patents and 14 U.S. patent applications pending. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective.
We actively pursue registration of our trademarks, logos, service marks, and domain names in the United States and in other key jurisdictions. We are the registered holder of a variety of United States and international domain names that include the term Zendesk or certain variations. Our products and services utilize our “Zendesk” trademark as well as our logo and images.
We also rely on certain intellectual property rights that we license from third parties, including under certain open source licenses. Though such third-party technologies may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, we believe that alternative technologies would be available to us.
Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, and other processes generated by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information, and all of our key employees and contractors have done so. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our vendors and customers. We also control and monitor access to, and distribution of, our software, documentation, and other proprietary information. 
Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, a variety of contractual arrangements, and confidentiality procedures, we believe that factors such as the technical and creative skills of our personnel, development of new features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our products are more fundamental to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
Culture and Employees
As a company we are highly focused on our customers and their success. To support this focus, we highly value simplicity, agility, sincerity, as well as a sense of humor and humility often absent from enterprises that sell business software. These values guide our communication, work, and company culture and are a cornerstone of the team of employees that we have assembled and seek to develop. We are a global and diverse group of individuals that strive to balance work with play and that focus on big-scale thinking.
10

We believe strongly in our obligation to participate in and improve the communities in which we work and live. We do this by offering an active roster of corporate social responsibility engagements. In 2015, we launched the Zendesk Neighbor Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing financial and strategic support to organizations that operate near our offices around the world. In addition to our extensive volunteer efforts, we have continued to offer workforce development and training, financial support for critical community programs, and promotion of local arts and culture, with the communities in which our offices are located and our employees live and work.
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,740 employees, including approximately 1,300 employees located outside the United States. Although we have statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries, our U.S. employees are not represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Regulatory Considerations
The legal environment of Internet-based businesses is evolving rapidly in the United States and elsewhere. The manner in which existing laws and regulations are applied in this environment, and how they will relate to our business in particular, both in the United States and internationally, is often unclear. For example, we sometimes cannot be certain which laws will be deemed applicable to us given the global nature of our business, including with respect to such topics as data privacy and security, pricing, credit card fraud, advertising, taxation, content regulation, and intellectual property ownership and infringement.
Our customers, and those with whom they communicate using our products, upload and store customer service and other data into our products and provide access to their data sources to our products, generally without any restrictions imposed by us. This presents legal challenges to our business and operations, such as rights of privacy related to the content loaded into our products. Both in the United States and internationally, we must monitor and comply with a host of legal concerns regarding the data stored and processed in our products as well as the operation of our business.
We are subject to data privacy and security regulation by data protection authorities in countries throughout the world, by the U.S. federal government, and by the states in which we conduct our business. In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of personal information of individuals. Many governing authorities have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and public officials or amending existing laws to expand compliance obligations. In the European Union, U.S. companies must meet specified privacy and security standards, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which govern the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personally identifiable information, or PII, and on the free movement of such data established in the European Union to certain non-EU countries, such as the United States. Additionally, the data protection laws of each of the European Member countries require comprehensive information privacy and security protections for consumers with respect to PII collected about them. In February 2016, European Union and U.S. officials announced an agreement, which established the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, or the Privacy Shield, as a means for legitimating the transfer of PII by U.S. companies doing business in Europe from the European Economic Area to the U.S. We have certified compliance with the Privacy Shield. In June 2017, we announced that we completed the EU approval process for our global Binding Corporate Rules ("BCRs") as a data processor and controller. This significant regulatory approval validated our implementation of the highest possible standards for protecting PII globally, covering both the PII of our customers and employees. We have and expect to continue to engage in efforts to ensure that data transfers from the European Economic Area comply with the GDPR, the Privacy Shield, our BCRs, and the data protection legislation of individual member states.
