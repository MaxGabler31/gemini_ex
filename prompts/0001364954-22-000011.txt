ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 

Millions of people all around the world Learn with Chegg. Our mission is to improve learning and learning outcomes by putting students first. We support life-long learners starting with their academic journey and extending into their careers. The Chegg platform provides products and services to support learners to help them better understand their academic course materials, and also provides personal and professional development skills training, to help them achieve their learning goals. 
Our product and service offerings fall into two categories: Chegg Services, which encompasses our subscription services and which can be accessed internationally through our websites and on mobile devices, and Required Materials, which includes print textbooks and eTextbooks. In 2021, approximately 7.8 million students subscribed to our Chegg Services, an increase of 18% year over year from 6.6 million in 2020. Chegg Services subscribers include Chegg Study, Chegg Writing, Chegg Math Solver, Chegg Study Pack, Mathway, and Thinkful customers who have paid to access the service during the time period. In 2021, we had 30 million monthly average visitors, an increase of 58% year over year from 19 million monthly average visitors in 2020. Monthly average visitors represent the average of unique visitors for all Chegg properties. 
Chegg Services
Chegg Study Pack. Our Chegg Study Pack is a premium subscription bundle including our Chegg Study, Chegg Writing, and Chegg Math Solver services, which are described further below. Chegg Study Pack creates an integrated platform of connected academic support services which have millions of pieces of educational learning content and enhanced features, such as concept video walkthroughs, flashcards and practice tests, that are ever-changing and evolving to increase our value proposition to students. We plan to launch instructor-created materials from educators within our Uversity platform as part of the Chegg Study Pack in 2022. Our Uversity platform was created to improve the quality and accessibility of learning materials provided to students around the world. The platform allows educators and faculty to share their educational content, such as study notes, videos, and practice tests, to further support students’ learning and enhance their outcomes. 
Chegg Study. Our Chegg Study subscription service helps students master challenging concepts on their own through the use of “Expert Questions and Answers” and “Textbook Solutions.” Our Expert Questions and Answers service allows students to ask questions on our website and receive detailed explanations from subject matter experts. For high demand print textbooks and eTextbooks, we offer Textbook Solutions, which are step-by-step explanations to help students learn how to solve the questions at the end of each chapter in their textbooks.
Chegg Writing. Our Chegg Writing service consists of a free, ad-supported service and a premium paid subscription service providing students with a suite of tools, including plagiarism detection scans, grammar and writing fluency checking, expert personalized writing feedback, and premium citation generation. Students can create citations from over 7,000 citation styles including MLA, APA, and The Chicago Manual of Style. Students can also upload papers to have them scanned for plagiarism by checking against billions of sources and to have them checked for over 200 types of writing and grammar errors. Students can also have a writing professional proofread their papers and receive personalized feedback. Chegg Writing also includes the popular website properties EasyBib, Citation Machine, BibMe, and CiteThisForMe.
Chegg Math. Our Chegg Math subscription services, including Mathway, help students understand math by providing a step-by-step math problem solver and calculator that help students instantly receive guided instructional explanations to better understand the why and how for each step within a range of math topics.
Busuu. In January 2022, we completed our acquisition of Busuu Online S.L. (Busuu), an online language learning company that offers a comprehensive solution through a combination of self-paced lessons, live classes with expert tutors and the ability to learn and practice with members of the Busuu language learning community. The Busuu methodology has been developed by leading experts in online language learning pedagogy and can bring students from novice to advanced speakers of a language rapidly and enjoyably. When students want to learn a new language for work, study or personal interest, they can use our service to access comprehensive courses in 13 languages, connect with Busuu’s community of native speakers to practice their conversation and receive expert instruction from our highly qualified teachers. Busuu will expand our existing offerings and global reach through language learning, allowing us to drive further into international markets.
Thinkful. Thinkful is our skills-based learning service that offers professional courses along with networking, interviewing, and career services. Thinkful is offered directly through our website and through partners that connect employers with top learning providers to provide employees with upskilling opportunities.
Other Services. We also provide students with other services, such as Chegg Life, Chegg Prep and Chegg Internships. 
Required Materials
Print Textbooks and eTextbooks. For students looking to save on the cost of required materials, we rent and sell both print textbooks and eTextbooks. Most of the print textbook transactions are rentals, although we also offer both new and used textbooks for sale at a slight markup to our acquisition cost. We work with a third party logistic provider to provide warehousing and logistic services for our print textbooks. We have also entered into agreements with other partners to provide their textbooks for rental or sale. In participation with certain publishers, we also offer “Instant Access” to eTextbooks as a one-week free trial of our eTextbook service, and allow students access while the print copy is in transit. eTextbooks obtained from Chegg can be accessed anytime and anywhere and are viewed through our eTextbook reader that enables fast and easy navigation, keyword search, text highlighting, note taking and further preserves those notes in an online notepad with the ability to view highlighting and notes across platforms.
Technology and Platform Integration 
Our technology is designed to create a direct-to-student learning platform that will continue to enable our growth at scale. We employ technological innovations whenever possible to increase efficiency and scale in our business. Our products rely upon and leverage the information underlying our “Student Graph” and “Content Graph Technology” discussed in more detail below. We will continue to invest in building technologies around our data, search and solutions. The key elements of our technology platform are: 
Personalization and Merchandising Technology
We create a personalized experience for each student throughout our learning platform, building awareness of our multiple services and connecting them with opportunities through third-party partners and brands. This personalization and customization results from our Student Graph and our search technology. 
Student Graph. Our Student Graph is the accumulation of the collective activity of students in our learning platform. Students generate valuable information each time they engage with our learning platform. Our Student Graph also includes information we access from public and private sources such as textbook information, information about colleges and scholarship data. We can collect, organize and process this information to algorithmically create a personalized experience for each student on our network. 
Search. Search is an easy on-ramp for students to discover all of our services. Students can search by book, ISBN, author’s name or course. Many students come to us for textbook rentals, and in our search results we not only provide the relevant textbook, but also begin to build awareness of our other services. For instance, when a student searches for a textbook, we can show relevant Chegg Study solutions or Flashcard decks.
Data Sourcing and Content Graph Technology
Not all information relevant to students on our platform is made available by service, product, list or user-input. Therefore, we have developed proprietary technologies to collect disparate, distributed sets of data. For example, we access data from public and private sources to integrate into our platform to inform our decisions about our textbook catalog and pricing. 
Mobile Solutions
We have mobile applications on Apple iOS and Google Android. Our mobile apps are built as hybrid applications leveraging the Chegg application programming interface (API). Taking advantage of capabilities unique to the mobile platform, we offer some functionality on mobile that is not available on our website, such as textbook barcode scanning for price comparisons and Chegg Prep. 
Real-time Sourcing and Pricing Technologies
We have internally developed proprietary pricing and sourcing systems that consider market price, content selection and availability, and other factors, in determining price and origin of content and services we offer to students. 
Programmatic Advertising
Our programmatic advertising technology includes a combination of a deep understanding of programmatic technology trends with data science, engineering and machine learning. The result is an online advertising platform that maximizes the value of the digital impressions we serve.
Infrastructure and Applications
Our technology resides at major cloud-hosting providers globally. Our architecture consists primarily of front end applications, backend services, operational databases, and reporting subsystems. We use industry standard logging and monitoring tools to ensure uptime. The architecture is also designed to allow for expansion into new international markets. 
Information Security. Our platform includes encryption, antivirus, firewall, intrusion prevention, and patch-management technologies to help protect our systems distributed across cloud-hosting providers and our business offices. Our existing products and services undergo periodic security assessment. New features are developed according to our secure software development lifecycle process. We also monitor for anomalies relating to authentication, data transfers, system, and user behavior as well as cloud configuration changes. 
Internal Management Systems. We rely on third-party technology solutions and products as well as internally developed and proprietary systems, in which we have made substantial investment, to provide rapid, high-quality customer service, internal communication, software development, deployment, and maintenance. 
Customers 
In 2021, 8.9 million customers paid for our products and services, up from 8.2 million and 5.8 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Sales and Marketing 
Students 
We use several major direct marketing channels to reach students. We deploy search engine optimization (SEO) techniques designed to increase the visibility of Chegg.com content in organic, unpaid search engine result listings. We supplement our SEO efforts through search engine marketing using keyword simulation and bid management tools to analyze and categorize search keywords, optimize bidding, increase impressions and drive conversion. We also drive brand awareness with streaming radio and display advertising on major online and mobile advertising networks, such as Spotify and Google Display Network. We integrate our textbook services on affiliates’ websites and work with a large advertising network that recruits individual online affiliates in exchange for predetermined revenue share or commissions. We utilize three types of email marketing campaigns: onboarding programs to drive activation and retention, personalized cross-sell campaigns to deepen engagement, and promotional campaigns to drive sales and interests. We use social media to manage organic and paid programs across top websites, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. We also acquire and engage students through content generated by student bloggers, syndicated through partners, around key student concerns and interests such as admissions, transition to college, picking a major, and resume preparation. Through our campus activation programs, we partner with brands and influencers to bring entertainment events, such as concerts, trial promotions, and product giveaways to students.
Brands
We secure contracts with brands through direct sales by our field sales organization, which sells brand advertising services to large brand advertisers seeking to reach and engage college and high school students. This team has field sales people and marketing support.
Student Advocacy 
We are committed to providing a high level of customer service to our students and to our brand promise of putting students first. We trust our students, understand the critical role our products and services have in their learning journey, and strive to resolve all problems quickly and thoroughly. Our student advocacy team can be reached directly through phone, email, and online chat during business hours. We also proactively monitor social media to identify and solve problems before we are otherwise informed of their existence. We endeavor to respond to students’ concerns within five minutes. 
Competition 
While we do not have any competitors that compete with us across our business in its entirety, we face significant global competition in each of our product and service offerings. Our Chegg Services face competition from different businesses depending on the offering. For Chegg Study, our competitors primarily include platforms that provide study materials and online instructional systems, such as Course Hero, Quizlet, Khan Academy, Bartleby, and Brainly. For Chegg Writing, we primarily face competition from other citation generating and grammar and plagiarism services, such as Grammarly. For Chegg Math Solver and Mathway, we face competition from other equation solver services, such as Photomath and Symbolab. For Busuu, our competitors primarily include language learning platforms, such as Duolingo and Babbel. For Thinkful, we face competition from other online learning platforms and online “skills accelerator” courses both in the direct-to-consumer category, including General Assembly, Galvanize, Inc., Flatiron School, Codecademy, DataCamp, and Lambda, Inc., as well as white-label and co-branded providers who compete for adult learners through third party institutions, including 2U, Inc., Simplilearn, and Kenzie Academy. Additionally, the market for textbooks is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We face competition from college bookstores, some of which are operated by Follett and Barnes & Noble Education, online marketplaces such as Amazon.com, providers of eTextbooks, as well as various private textbook rental websites.
We believe that we have competitive strengths that position us favorably in each aspect of our business. However, the education industry is evolving rapidly and is increasingly competitive. A variety of business models are being pursued or may be considered for the provision of digital learning tools, print textbooks and eTextbooks, some of which may be more profitable or successful than our business model. 
Intellectual Property 
We use proprietary technology to operate our business and our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our technology and intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our intellectual property. We maintain a policy requiring our employees, contractors, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our proprietary information. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 40 issued patents that will expire between 2031 and 2039 and 15 patent applications pending in the United States. As of December 31, 2021, we also owned four U.S. copyrights registrations and had unregistered copyrights in our software documentation, marketing materials, and website content that we develop, owned over 700 registered domain names, and owned 25 U.S. trademark registrations and 42 foreign registrations. 
We own the registered U.S. trademarks Chegg, Chegg.com, Chegg Study, internships.com, Research Ready, EasyBib, the Chegg “C” logo, Busuu and Thinkful, among others, as well as a variety of service marks. We also have a number of pending trademark applications in the United States and unregistered marks that we use to promote our brand. From time to time we expect to file additional patent, copyright, and trademark applications in the United States and abroad. 
Government Regulation 
We are subject to a number of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and in the education industry, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. The manner in which existing laws and regulations will be applied to the Internet and students in general and how they will relate to our business in particular, are often unclear. For example, we often cannot be certain how existing laws will apply in the e-commerce and online context, including with respect to such topics as privacy, cybersecurity, defamation, pricing, credit card fraud, advertising, taxation, sweepstakes, promotions, content regulation, financial aid, scholarships, student matriculation and recruitment, quality of products and services, and intellectual property ownership and 
infringement. In addition, we may be subject to state oversight for Thinkful's skills-based learning programs, including regulatory approvals and licensure for the course content, the faculty members teaching the content, and the recruiting, admissions, and marketing activities associated with the business.
Numerous laws and regulatory schemes have been adopted at the national and state level in the United States, and internationally, that have a direct impact on our business and operations. For example: 
The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (CAN-SPAM) establishes requirements for sending commercial email and requires commercial email senders to honor consumers’ requests to not receive email. Violators of CAN-SPAM are subject to both civil and potentially criminal penalties. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has guidelines that impose responsibilities on us with respect to communications with consumers and impose fines and liability for failure to comply with rules with respect to advertising or marketing practices it may deem misleading or deceptive. Similarly, several states have enacted laws that prohibit “falsity or deception” in commercial emails and that give recipients of such emails a right of action and ability to seek damages.
The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) restricts telemarketing and the use of automated telephone dialing systems. The TCPA regulates the use of artificial or prerecorded voice messages, fax messages, and the use of automatic dialing systems for both voice calls and sending text messages. Additionally, a number of states have enacted statutes that address telemarketing. For example, some states, such as Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming, still have do-not-call lists. Other states, such as Oregon and Washington, have enacted “no rebuttal statutes” that require the telemarketer to end the call when the consumer indicates that he or she is not interested in the product being sold. Restrictions on telephone marketing, including calls and text messages, are enforced by the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission, states, and through the availability of statutory damages and class action lawsuits for violations of the TCPA. 

The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, or CARD Act, and similar laws and regulations adopted by a number of states regulate credit card and gift certificate use fairness, including expiration dates and fees. Our business also requires that we comply with payment card industry data security and other standards. In particular, we are subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, reputational damage, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
Regulations related to the Program Participation Agreement of the U.S. Department of Education and other similar laws that regulate the recruitment of students to colleges and other institutions of higher learning.
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects the privacy of student records and gives students (and their parents in the case of minors), certain rights (such as data correction and data production), with respect to their student records. FERPA restricts the circumstances in which we can disclose student records. In addition, many states have passed student privacy laws, some of which are more restrictive than FERPA, and therefore do not pre-empt FERPA.

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act imposes additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect, use, and disclose personal information from minors. In addition, certain states, including Utah and Massachusetts, have laws that impose criminal penalties on the production and distribution of content that is “harmful to a minor.” Delaware Code 1204C prohibits websites and applications directed at children from marketing or advertising products or services that are inappropriate for children.
California’s Privacy Rights for California Minors in the Digital World Act (Eraser Bill) permits minors to remove or request and obtain removal of content or information posted on our services. The Eraser Bill also has special requirements for marketing and advertising certain products based on personal information specific to a minor or knowingly using, disclosing or compiling or allowing a third party to do so.
California has several laws protecting the literary works read by California residents. The California Reader Privacy Act protects information about the books California residents read from electronic services. Such information cannot be disclosed except pursuant to an individual’s affirmative consent, a warrant or court order with limited exceptions, such as imminent danger of serious injury. California Education Code Section 99122 requires for-profit postsecondary educational institutions to post a social media privacy policy on their website.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) provides relief for claims of circumvention of copyright protected technologies and includes a safe harbor intended to reduce the liability of online service providers for hosting, listing, or linking to third-party content that infringes copyrights of others. 
The Communications Decency Act provides that online service providers will not be considered the publisher or speaker of content provided by others, such as individuals who post content on an online service provider’s website. 
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, provides consumers the right to know what personal data companies collect, how it is used, and the right to access, delete, and opt out of the sale of their personal information to third parties. It also expands the definition of personal information and gives consumers increased privacy rights and protections for that information. The CCPA also includes special requirements for California consumers under the age of 16.
The Nevada Online Privacy Law, which went into effect October 1, 2021 provides Nevada residents with the right to know our data practices and the right to opt-out of the sale of certain “covered information.” 
The California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA) and Colorado Privacy Act (CPA) all come into effect on January 1, 2023. These laws provide consumers with the right to know what personal data companies collect, how it is used, and the right to access, delete, and opt out of the sale of their personal information to third parties. The CPRA also includes special requirements for California consumers under the age of 16.
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which went into effect in May 2018 gives European Union (EU) residents, among other things, rights to right to know what personal data we collect from them, how it is used, and the right to access, correct, delete, and opt out of the sale of their personal information to third parties. We are also required to obtain consent from consumers in certain circumstances and adhere to certain data transfer mechanisms to transfer EU personal data to certain other jurisdictions. The Safe Harbor framework that many companies relied on to transfer data was recently found to be invalid. We rely on standard contracts for data transfers from the EU, and the standard contractual clauses were recently substantially revised, and we do not yet fully comply with implementing the new standard contractual clauses. As regulatory authorities continue to issue further guidance on personal data, we could suffer additional costs, complaints or regulatory investigations or fines. The GDPR sets a maximum fine of €20 million or 4% of annual global turnover for infringements – whichever is greater. If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results.
The United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act 2018 (Data Protection Act) and UK General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”) apply to our activities in the United Kingdom. They have similar requirements to those noted above relating to GDPR. The Data Protection Act and UK GDPR set a maximum fine of £17.5 million or 4% of annual global turnover for infringements – whichever is greater – for infringements.
Israel’s Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, 5752 1992 (IBL HDL), the Protection of Privacy Law, 5741-1981 and the regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the PPL), and the guidelines of the Israel Privacy Authority (IPA Guidelines) apply to our activities in Israel. PPL gives Israeli residents, among other things, the right to know what personal data we collect from them, how it is used, and the right to access, correct, and erase their personal information to third parties. Under the PPL, we are required to, among other things, register our databases in Israel, take steps to secure personal data and sensitive data such as creating a database settings document, developing an information security policy and training employees. PPL also has strict regulations regarding transferring data outside of Israel. PPL provides for both civil and criminal penalties with a maximum financial penalty of ILS 25,000 and additional fines if the violation is on-going, and a maximum criminal penalty of imprisonment for up to five years.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,736 employees, of which 1,613 were full-time and 123 were part-time. Additionally, 851 were located outside the United States. None of our workforce is covered under a collective bargaining agreement. We appreciate that our employees are our greatest asset and place a premium on the importance of their retention, growth, and development. We offer competitive compensation, including salary and equity, and benefits packages tailored to each of our locations around the world. All employees are offered training and development opportunities, from leadership training and coaching to career development programs for all levels of employees. We believe that a diverse workforce makes us a stronger company and helps us better serve the needs of our customers. We are focused on understanding our culture, belonging and diversity strengths and opportunities and defining and executing on a strategy to support further progress. We have employee-driven resource groups that are aligned around creating a culture of belonging and awareness for our diverse workforce. These groups are centered around gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or other shared attributes, which we believe help build 
community and enable opportunities for both personal and professional development. We continue to focus on building a strong talent pipeline to create more opportunities for workplace diversity, support greater representation within the organization, and build a company that is truly reflective of the diverse audience we serve. Please see the Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) section of our investor relations website (www.investor.chegg.com/esg) for relevant metrics and to learn more about Chegg’s efforts around culture, belonging, diversity, and inclusion. 
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of our global employee population continues to work remotely. This comes with many challenges for our employees which provided us with the opportunity to increase our support programs. To support our employees, we decided to continue our childcare reimbursement program into 2022, provide benefits related to substance abuse issues for employees, and continue to provide flexible time off for employees to deal with the difficulties of an extended remote work environment. We also increased our all employee communications as well as updated our onboarding programs to help employees feel connected in a new virtual world.
Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG)
At Chegg, our approach to ESG is tied to our mission to help every learner achieve their best, in school and beyond. We believe our greatest impact is enabling students to succeed and improving the outcome of their education so that they can quickly move from learning to earning. To do this, we focus on listening to their needs, elevating and amplifying their voices, and taking action to provide real life solutions. 
Just like our approach with students, we take the same level of care to engage with our stakeholders to help prioritize our ESG efforts, which we categorize into six pillars, as outlined below. This approach is informed by the materiality assessment we conducted in 2021, in which we engaged both internal and external stakeholders to identify the ESG topics that are most relevant to our business and to society. 
Focus on People
We focus on people by making Chegg a great place to work. We foster an environment centered on respect for all people, where diversity and inclusion are celebrated, and people have the opportunity to develop and advance their careers. Our employees are one of our biggest competitive advantages, and it's our responsibility to take care of them.
Help Learners
Learners are evolving and so is Chegg. Learners need more flexibility when it comes to education, including affordable, on-demand help that delivers positive learning outcomes. We are extremely proud to have helped so many learners succeed on their learning-to-earning journey. 
Give Back
Chegg’s business activities as well as our philanthropic, research and community efforts align with many of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. We have identified three of these goals where we believe Chegg’s influence is the greatest: #4 – Quality Education, #3 – Good Health and Well-Being, and #2 – Zero Hunger.
Act Responsibly
We understand that to be a true customer champion and to gain and preserve our customers’ trust, we must operate all facets of our business with integrity, including a focus on protecting learners’ data. We hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards and strive for full compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Govern Effectively 
Chegg has a commitment to strong corporate governance practices. Corporate governance is part of our culture and is founded on our daily commitment to living values and principles that recognize our ethical obligations to our employees, customers and stockholders.
Operate Sustainably
Chegg strives to make the planet a better place. To do our part, we are focused on sustainable operations and we are committed to finding ways to help reduce our environmental impact. We know that we owe it to our customers, employees, and society to use environmentally sound practices and to find ways to limit our contribution to global climate change.
