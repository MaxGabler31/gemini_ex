Government Regulation
 
Advertising Services
 
Business Licenses for Advertising Companies
 
The principal regulations governing the advertising businesses in China include:
 

l | The Advertising Law (1994);
--+----------------------------


l | Regulations on Control of Advertisement (1987); and
--+----------------------------------------------------


l | The Implementing Rules for the Advertising Administrative Regulations (2004).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These regulations stipulate that companies that engage in advertising activities must obtain from the SAIC or its local branches a business license which specifically includes operating an advertising business within its business scope. Companies conducting advertising activities without such a license may be subject to penalties, including fines, confiscation of advertising income and orders to cease advertising operations. The business license of an advertising company is valid for the duration of its existence, unless the license is suspended or revoked due to a violation of any relevant law or regulation.
 
We do not expect to encounter any difficulties in maintaining our business licenses. Our PRC advertising operating companies hold business license from the local branches of the SAIC as required by the existing PRC regulations.
 
Advertising Content
 
PRC advertising laws and regulations set forth certain content requirements for advertisements in China, which include prohibitions on, among other things, misleading content, superlative wording, socially destabilizing content or content involving obscenities, superstition, violence, discrimination or infringement of the public interest. Advertisements for anesthetic, psychotropic, toxic or radioactive drugs are prohibited. It is prohibited to disseminate tobacco advertisements via broadcast or print media. It is also prohibited to display tobacco advertisements in any waiting lounge, theater, cinema, conference hall, stadium or other public area. There are also specific restrictions and requirements regarding advertisements that relate to matters such as patented products or processes, pharmaceuticals, medical instruments, veterinary pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, foodstuffs, alcohol and cosmetics. In addition, all advertisements relating to pharmaceuticals, medical instruments, agrochemicals and veterinary pharmaceuticals advertised through radio, film, television, newspaper, magazine and other forms of media, together with any other advertisements which are subject to censorship by administrative authorities according to relevant laws and administrative regulations, must be submitted to the relevant administrative authorities for content approval prior to dissemination.
 
Advertisers, advertising operators and advertising distributors are required by PRC advertising laws and regulations to ensure that the content of the advertisements they prepare or distribute are true and in full compliance with applicable laws. In providing advertising services, advertising operators and advertising distributors must review the prescribed supporting documents provided by advertisers for advertisements and verify that the content of the advertisements comply with applicable PRC laws and regulations. In addition, prior to distributing advertisements for certain commodities, which are subject to government censorship and approval, advertising distributors and advertisers are obligated to ensure that such censorship has been performed and approval has been obtained. Violation of these regulations may result in penalties, including fines, confiscation of advertising income, orders to cease dissemination of the advertisements and orders to publish an advertisement correcting the misleading information. In circumstances involving serious violations, the SAIC or its local branches may revoke violators’ licenses or permits for advertising business operations. Furthermore, advertisers, advertising operators or advertising distributors may be subject to civil liability if they infringe on the legal rights and interests of third parties in the course of their advertising business. We have implemented procedures to ensure the content of our advertisement are properly reviewed and the advertisement would only be published upon the receipt of content approval from the relevant administrative authorities. However, we provide no assurance that all the content of the advertisement are true and in full compliance with applicable laws.
 
Out-of-home Advertising
 
The Advertising Law stipulates that the exhibition and display of out-of-home advertisements must not:
 

l | utilize traffic safety facilities and traffic signs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


l | impede the use of public facilities, traffic safety facilities and traffic signs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


l | obstruct commercial and public activities or create an eyesore in urban areas;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


l | be placed in restrictive areas near government offices, cultural landmarks or historical or scenic sites; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


l | be placed in areas prohibited by the local governments from having out-of-home advertisements.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the Advertising Law, the SAIC promulgated the Out-of-home Advertising Registration Administrative Regulations on December 8, 1995, as amended on December 3, 1998, and May 22, 2006, which governs the out-of-home advertising industry in China.
 
Out-of-home advertisements in China must be registered with the local SAIC before dissemination. The advertising distributors are required to submit a registration application form and other supporting documents for registration. After review and examination, if an application complies with the requirements, the local SAIC will issue an Out-of-home Advertising Registration Certificate for such advertisement. Many municipal cities of China have respectively promulgated their own local regulations on the administration of out-of-home advertisements. Those municipal regulations set forth specific requirements on the out-of-home advertisements, such as the allowed places of dissemination and size requirements of the out-of-home advertisement facilities.
 
In addition to the regulations on out-of-home advertisements, the placement and installation of LED billboards are also subject to municipal local zoning requirements and relevant governmental approvals of the city where the LED billboards located. In Shanghai, prior to the placement and installation of LED billboards, installers are required to apply for an out-of-home advertising registration certificate for each LED billboard subject to a term of use approved by local government agency for each LED billboard. If the existing LED billboards placed by our LED location provider or us are required to be removed, the attractiveness of this portion of our advertising network will be diminished.
 
Foreign Currency Exchange
 
The principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in China is the Rules on Foreign Exchange Control (1996), as amended. Under these rules, Renminbi is freely convertible for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for direct investment, loan or investment outside China without the prior approval of the State Administration for Foreign Exchange of the PRC or other relevant authorities is obtained.
 
Pursuant to the Rules on Foreign Exchange Control, foreign investment enterprises in China may purchase foreign currency without the approval of the State Administration for Foreign Exchange of the PRC for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions by providing commercial documents evidencing these transactions. They may also exchange Renminbi into foreign currencies (subject to a cap approved by the State Administration for Foreign Exchange of the PRC) to satisfy foreign exchange liabilities or to pay dividends. However, the relevant PRC government authorities may limit or eliminate the ability of foreign investment enterprises to purchase and retain foreign currencies in the future. In addition, foreign exchange transactions for direct investment, loan and investment outside China are still subject to limitations and require approvals from the State Administration for Foreign Exchange of the PRC.
 
Dividend Distributions
 
The principal regulations governing distribution of dividends of wholly foreign-owned companies include:
 

l | the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law (1986), as amended; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


l | Administrative Rules under the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law (2001).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Under these regulations, foreign investment enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, wholly foreign-owned enterprises in China are required to set aside at least 10% of their after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds, until such reserve funds have reached 50% of the enterprise’s registered capital. These reserves are restricted and not distributable as cash dividends.
 
We have not received any dividends or fees from our PRC subsidiaries or affiliated Chinese entities in the past three years. As all our PRC subsidiaries are currently still operating at a net loss, we are unable to estimate the time to receive dividends or other fees.
 
Enterprise Income Tax Law
 
The Enterprise Income Tax Law, or EIT Law, was promulgated by the PRC’s National People’s Congress on March 16, 2007 to introduce a new uniform taxation regime in the PRC. Both resident and non-resident enterprises deriving income from the PRC were subject to the EIT Law from January 1, 2008. It applies a single income tax rate to all enterprises in the PRC. Under this EIT Law, enterprises that qualify as “new and high technology enterprises” (“high-tech companies”) are entitled to a preferential tax rate of 15% and in other very limited situation entities may be subject to a EIT rate of 20%, but the general EIT rate is 25%.
 
We believe that each of our PRC operating entities were resident enterprises and subject to the enterprise income tax rate of 25% for their global income. We do not believe that any of our off-shore entities are resident enterprises as our off-shore entities didn’t provide any services in the PRC and their management and controls are all located outside China; permanent establishment does not exist and hence they would not fall into the resident enterprise category. However, we cannot provide assurance that all our offshore operating entities are not “resident enterprises” as there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and implementation of current PRC tax rule and regulation.
