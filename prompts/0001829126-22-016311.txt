Applied Magix
 
On October 20, 2020, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Dr. Harald Zink and Richard Kelly Clark, sole shareholders of Applied Magix, a Nevada corporation, pursuant to which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Applied Magix.
 
Through our wholly owned subsidiary Applied Magix we are a registered Apple® developer, and reseller of Apple ecosystem compatible products and accessories with an emphasis on the smart home market. As such, we are in the global “Internet of Things” (IoT) market, and more specifically, the segment of the market related to the development, manufacture and sale of devices and accessories specifically built on Apple’s HomeKit® framework. These products work within the Apple® HomeKit® ecosystem and are exclusive to the Apple market and its consumers. Apple® HomeKit® is a system that lets users control smart home devices, so long as they are compatible with the HomeKit® ecosystem, giving users control over smart thermostat, lights, locks and more in multiple rooms, creating comfortable environments and remote control of other connected devices.
 
Apple® HomeKit® app for iOS lets users securely control, organize and manage any smart home devices labeled as a "Works with Apple HomeKit” accessory. In the app, users can organize accessories by room, manage multiple accessories at the same time, control a home with Siri, and more.
 
SPYR APPS, LLC
 
On March 24, 2015, the Company organized its wholly owned subsidiary SPYR APPS®, LLC, a Nevada Limited Liability Company, to engage in the development and publication of electronic games that are downloaded for free by users of mobile devices such as cellular telephones and tablets, including those using Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android mobile operating systems.
 
Historically, through our wholly owned subsidiary, SPYR APPS®, LLC, we engaged in the development, publication and co-publication of mobile electronic games, seeking to generate revenue through those games by way of advertising and in-app purchases. Contracting with a third-party developer, we released three games: “Plucky,” “Plucky Rush” and Rune Guardian in April, May and December 2015, respectively. Also, in 2015, we entered into a publishing and marketing agreement with Spectacle Games Publishing, for its “Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game,” “Pocket Starships.” In 2016 we obtained an exclusive option to purchase all assets pertaining to Pocket Starships and on October 23, 2017, we restructured and exercised the option by entering into a definitive agreement pursuant to which we acquired all of the game related assets of Pocket Starships. As a result, we acquired rights to retain 100% of the revenue generated from the game and owned outright all of the assets related to the game. The acquisition included, among other assets, all Pocket Starships related intellectual property, the userbase, artwork, software, internet domains, game store accounts (such as App Store, Play Store, Amazon, and Facebook Gameroom), web portal accounts (Facebook, VK.com, Kongregate, etc.) and internet domains (www.pocketstarships.com). In 2017 we signed an agreement with CBS Consumer Products to incorporate Start Trek intellectual property into Pocket Starships. Also, in 2017, we entered into an agreement with Reset Studios, LLC for the development of two new idle tapper games, the first of which was Steven Universe: Tap Together. As of December 31, 2019, the Cartoon Network license for the Steven Universe IP was terminated and the game was removed from the stores. As of December 31, 2020, all of our games have been removed from the game stores. Pursuant to current accounting guidelines, the assets, and liabilities of SPYR APPS LLC as well as the results of its operations are presented in these financial statements as discontinued operations. On February 2, 2022, we filed a Certificate of Dissolution for SPYR APPS, LLC.

E.A.J.: PHL, Airport Inc.
 
Through our other wholly owned subsidiary, E.A.J.: PHL Airport, Inc., we owned and operated the restaurant “Eat at Joe’s®,” which was located in the Philadelphia International Airport since 1997. Our lease in the Philadelphia Airport expired in April 2017. Concurrent with expiration of the lease the restaurant closed. Pursuant to current accounting guidelines, the assets and liabilities of E.A.J.: PHL, Airport Inc. as well as the results of its operations are presented in these financial statements as discontinued operations.
 
Operating Losses
 
The Company has incurred net loss from operations of $5,961,000 and $3,057,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Such operating losses reflect developmental and other administrative costs for 2021 and 2020. The Company expects to incur losses in the near future until profitability is achieved. The Company’s operations are subject to numerous risks associated with establishing any new business, including unforeseen expenses, delays, and complications. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve or sustain profitable operations.
Future Capital Needs and Uncertainty of Additional Funding
 
Revenues are not yet sufficient to support the Company’s operating expenses and are not expected to reach such levels until the Company completes its expansion plans in manufacturing, marketing and sales of Apple® HomeKit® products.
Our Business and Strategy
 
Our primary business operation is focused on the development of our wholly owned subsidiary Applied Magix Inc., a registered Apple® developer, and reseller of Apple® ecosystem compatible products and accessories with an emphasis on the smart home market. As such, we are in the global “Internet of Things” (IoT) market, and more specifically, the segment of the market related to the development, manufacture and sale of devices and accessories specifically built on Apple’s HomeKit® framework. These products work within the Apple® HomeKit® ecosystem and are exclusive to the Apple market and its consumers. Apple® HomeKit® is a system that lets users control smart home devices, so long as they’re compatible with the HomeKit® ecosystem, giving users control over smart thermostat, lights, locks and more in multiple rooms, creating comfortable environments and remote control of other connected devices. Our strategy is two-fold. First, we intend to resell, under our Applied Magix brand, a variety of chargers, cables, cords, charging docks, cases, cameras, adaptors and other accessories used in the Apple® ecosystem in various internet marketplaces. Secondly, we are developing an Applied Magix branded hardware device for use with the Apple HomeKit® framework, that will allow users to program and securely control and manage multiple smart home devices labeled as a "Works with Apple HomeKit” accessory through the Apple® HomeKit® app for iOS. To date, our strategy is in the development stage. We have yet to begin sales efforts for our branded Apple® ecosystem compatible products and accessories, and our Apple HomeKit® hardware device is in development.
 
We will also continue to identify and target acquisitions, which will grow our footprint in the technology industry and expand the products we offer consumers, including companies developing artificial intelligence and smart-technology products.
 
The Company intends to utilize cash on hand, shareholder loans and other forms of financing such as the sale of additional equity and debt securities, capital leases and other credit facilities to conduct its ongoing business, and to also conduct strategic business development, marketing analysis, due diligence investigations into possible acquisitions, and product development costs and implementation of our business plans generally. The Company also seeks to diversify, through acquisition or otherwise, in other related and/or unrelated business areas and is exploring opportunities to do so.
 
Government Regulation
 
The Company is subject to all pertinent federal, state, local, and international laws governing its business. Each subsidiary is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of authorities in its State or municipality. These may include health, safety, and fire regulations. The Company’s operations are also subject to Federal and State minimum wage laws governing such matters as working conditions, overtime and tip credits.

Competition
 
The Apple® HomeKit® market is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Our ability to compete depends upon many factors within and outside our control, including the timely development and introduction of the Apple® HomeKit® products we market and sell, along with the related enhancements, functionality, performance, reliability, customer service and support and marketing efforts. We expect additional competition from other emerging companies. Many of our existing and potential competitors are substantially larger than us and have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources that will compete for available Apple® HomeKit® products and development. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the Apple® HomeKit® market. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Employees
 
As of the date of this filing, the Company had 3 employees, none of whom is represented by a labor union.
