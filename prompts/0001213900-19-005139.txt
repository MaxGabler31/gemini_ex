Item 1. Business
Overview
 
HyreCar Inc. was formed as a corporation in the State of Delaware on November 24, 2014. Our founders identified the need for a car-sharing platform for individuals who wanted to drive for ride-sharing companies such as Uber Technologies Inc. (“Uber”) and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”), but whose automobiles could not meet the standards imposed by the ride-sharing companies. For example, Uber maintains strict guidelines regarding the types of cars a driver can use. Although guidelines relating to cars can differ by state, in general the use of two door coupes, motorcycles and cars that are 12 years or older are excluded. Our founders, before deciding to purchase qualifying sedans that met Uber’s strict guidelines, first inquired as to whether there were any rental options available from Uber that would allow them to drive for the ride-sharing platform. To their surprise, there were no rental options available, other than a shadow industry of individuals renting cars to one another.
 
HyreCar is a unique peer-to-peer car-sharing marketplace that allows car owners (collectively, “Owners”) to rent their idle cars to ride-sharing service drivers (collectively, “Drivers”). By sourcing vehicles from individual Owners, part-time Drivers may easily enter and exit the market and our business model allows us to satisfy fluctuating transportation demand in cities around the United States by matching Owners and Drivers.
 
Our business is based on a proprietary car-sharing marketplace developed to (i) onboard Owners and Drivers, (ii) facilitate the matching of Owners and Drivers and (iii) log rental activity for Owners and Drivers. All transactions related to the rental (including, but not limited to, background checks, rentals, deposits and insurance costs) are run securely through the HyreCar platform. Drivers and Owners access their rental or car dashboards through a unique login. Drivers can easily initiate, terminate or extend a rental through the platform while Owners can manage their car or fleet of cars through the platform.
 
We believe we have a competitive advantage with our commercial automobile insurance policy that covers both Owners and Drivers. The policy is specifically designed to cover the period of time in which a Driver is operating an Owner’s vehicle while not actively operating a vehicle on a ride-sharing platform, such as Uber or Lyft. During the periods when Drivers are actively operating on a ride-sharing platform, the insurance subordinates to the state mandated insurance provided by the ride-sharing business. To our knowledge, we are the only provider of this car-matching service which is made possible by this unique insurance product.
 
To date, the majority of our sales growth has been through organic search traffic. Going forward however, we intend to significantly increase our spending on marketing because we believe that online channels and offline brand awareness advertising will provide substantial opportunities for growth.
 
Industry and Market Opportunities
 
Our company was founded to capitalize on a combination of two growth markets: ride-sharing (an industry led by Uber and Lyft) and car-sharing (an industry led by companies such as Fair.com, Turo, Inc. and ZipCar, Inc.). Our customers are the Drivers that use our car-sharing platform to rent a car and then use that car to make money driving for either Uber or Lyft. Finding enough cars and drivers to meet demand has been a problem for ride-sharing companies.
 
The transportation industry represents a massive market. In the United States alone, consumer expenditures on transportation were approximately $1.2 trillion in 2017, and transportation was the second largest household expenditure after housing and was almost twice as large as healthcare and three times as large as entertainment. We believe we are still in the very early phases of capturing this massive opportunity. In 2016, ridesharing accounted for just one percent of the vehicle miles traveled in the United States and in a 2016 survey, 57% of U.S. respondents who used sharing services said that well-priced and convenient offerings could cause them to give up ownership altogether.

We believe that we are the only peer-to-peer car-sharing platform focused on the ride-sharing industry in the United States. We have added over 15,000 new Drivers, matching them with Owner vehicles that have been used on the Uber and Lyft platforms over the past several years. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we added approximately 7,600 and 4,400 new Drivers, respectively, into cars so that they could drive for Uber and Lyft. These numbers represent an equivalent 73.0% growth rate in new drivers onto the HyreCar platform year over year.
 
Ride-sharing Industry (Uber and Lyft)
 
The growth in ride-sharing over the past few years has kicked off a transportation revolution. Smart phones are now used as ride hailing apps, transactions are processed seamlessly through online platforms and transportation as a service is becoming more and more personalized. The industry has experienced tremendous traction. According to a July 2016 post on TechCrunch, it took Uber six years, to December 2015, to complete a billion rides and just six months later, Uber announced that it had completed its two-billionth ride.
 
Transportation Network Companies (“TNCs”) like Uber and Lyft have reported high demand from Drivers but many of these would be Drivers do not own a car that qualifies for their platforms. Lyft reported it had 1.9 million drivers in North America in 2018 and Uber reportedly has even more. In 2016, a spokesperson for Uber estimated that approximately 10% to 15% of their potential drivers/partners do not own a qualifying car. Further, Lyft estimates that there are approximately 60,000 people in the city of Chicago alone that want to drive for their platform, but do not currently own a qualifying car, and General Motors also estimates that there are approximately 160,000 potential drivers in the DC Metro area, Baltimore, Chicago and Boston who do not own a qualifying car.
 
Accordingly, TNCs are actively taking steps to satisfy their driver demand by setting up programs designed to get eligible drivers into qualified cars, including such programs as the Enterprise/Uber partnership, the Lyft Express Driver partnership with Hertz and Pep Boys, and the General Motor’s Maven program. These programs serve as a validation that there is a healthy market to pair eligible drivers with qualified cars.
 
Car-sharing Industry
 
In January 2016, The Economist reported that the trend to utilize cars during such idle periods is growing and even traditional car clubs are exploring the car-sharing market, where members of such clubs are allowed to book car usage by mobile app for periods as short as 15 minutes. Furthermore, such car-sharing usage is currently experiencing growth of over 30% a year, with a projected revenue collection of more than $16.5 billion by 2024. A study on the scope of the sharing economy published by UBS Global Research – Q Series titled “What is the Scope of the Sharing Economy” on July 20, 2016 estimates that the Shared Transportation segment, which they define as digitally enabled non-private transport, will recognize approximately $350 billion market opportunity by 2020, representing a 5-year compound annual growth rate of approximately 54%. We believe will be able to capitalize on this opportunity as existing demand from traditional taxi and public transportation options is transferred to shared transportation. Further, growth is expected from this opportunity as the accelerating trend of the mass ease-of-use and availability of shared transportation permanently shifts driving habits away from personal vehicle ownership. Evidence of this decline, while not yet a national trend, can be seen in large cities as vehicle ownership is beginning to decline. Longer term, we envision a potential impact on the auto industry as a whole from a subset of people permanently changing their driving habits and selling their cars entirely in favor of using shared transportation (UBS estimates that approximately 40 million cars will be replaced by 2020).
 
Another recent analysis by Morgan Stanley indicates that the estimated amount of global car miles traveled through shared vehicle usage by 2030 will hit 19.6 billion, or approximately 26% of all miles traveled (up from only 10.2 billion miles travelled in 2015). Given the excess capacity of vehicle hours, higher vehicle utilization rates, and lower vehicle ownership rates, we expect a consumer shift towards the acceptance of car-sharing as a part of everyday urban life.

Competition
 
The key differentiator between HyreCar and our competitors is that we crowd-source vehicles – we do not own or manage vehicles. This allows our prices to be competitive with other vehicle solutions because we do not have the monthly vehicle overhead or infrastructure costs that our competitors may have. Other advantages include the following:

1. | Pay-As-You-Go: Drivers using our platform are not locked into lengthy lease agreements, monthly contracts or subscription fees. Our payment model is upfront and transparent. While our competitors engage in auto-debiting payment for the rented vehicle from the Drivers’ accounts, regardless of their current account balance, under our platform Drivers pay for the term of rental up-front, extend if they are financially able, and return the rented vehicle whenever they need with no “strings” attached. We are the only company providing this type of fluid and frictionless car transaction for Uber and Lyft drivers. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Convenience: In some cases, drivers are renting a car from their neighbors. They walk down the street, take the keys and go. With Hertz or Avis, only one or two retail outlets participate in the Uber and Lyft programs. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Among vehicle solutions for ride-sharing rentals, there are Hertz, FlexDrive, Fair and HyreCar. These car rental companies are similar in one way: they operate in the U.S. and provide cars drivers to rent and drive on the Uber or Lyft platform. However, their business models vary widely. A comparative analysis of markets, pricing limitations and age requirements are as follows:
      
Available Markets | All 50 states + DC | ATL, Boston, Chicago, Denver, LA, Orange County, Miami, New Orleans, and the San Francisco Bay Area (May 2018) | ATL, Austin, Houston, LA, Philadelphia, and San Francisco | Only CA 
Rental Minimum | Minimum 2 days rental | Minimum 7-days rental and can only extend in 7 days increments 3 times then car has to be returned after 28 days for inspection. | Minimum 7 days rental Disqualified from Express Pay and driving bonuses | Minimum 7 Days but you can keep car as long as you want, after 3days / 100 miles return policy
Service Limitation | None, a Driver can drive for Lyft, Uber, Uber Eats, DoorDash, Postmates, etc. | Lyft Only | Lyft Only | Uber Only 
Deposit | $200 | $200 | $250 | $185.00 
Average Weekly Rates | Owners set pricing ~$250 per week | $240 /week + Tax and Mileage Fee | $209/week - taken directly out of earnings | $185.00 per Week 
Age Requirement | 21 | 25 | 25 | 21 
Other | Variety of different locations depending on the market to be picked up in 24 hours | Not available at all Hertz locations. Appointments don't always mean vehicles are available, can take weeks. | Pick up at CarMax locations. Must set an appointment days in advance, can take weeks to get into a car. | At Fair locations only in CA. Can pick car up within 48 hours after lengthy approval process. 

Our Strengths
 
Using our website platform or mobile applications (iOS and Android), vehicle Owners can post their cars to our marketplace and Drivers can browse car inventory prior to rental. Once a Driver finds a car, he or she creates a profile, enters his or her personal information and credentials (including, address, city, state, a copy of applicable state issued driver’s license, Uber or Lyft credentials, and SSN) and submits a credit card for payment. We then perform a criminal background check, DMV driving record check, Homeland Security Watch-list and Sex Offender database check. HyreCar’s screening criteria is stricter than Uber and Lyft’s background check. We are focused on maintaining a safe user experience and ensuring that all transactions between Owners and Drivers are processed through a secure web platform.

Why Drivers Use Our Service
 

● | Attractive Market: Drivers’ ability to earn income by driving for a ride-sharing business. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pay-As-You-Go: Drivers are not locked into long-term lease agreements, long-term monthly payments or subscription fees. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Convenience: Drivers can pick up the car from someone close by. Time from registration to getting behind the wheel currently averages under 48 hours. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Transparency and Trust: There are no hidden fees and only Owners that have been properly screened are permitted to use the platform. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Customer Experience: Application of game-design elements (i.e. gamification) of the platform keeps Drivers engaged. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why Owners Use Our Service
 
Data from a national survey of driving behavior indicates that private vehicles are in use 5% or less during any given day, or about one hour per day. Given the excess capacity of vehicle hours, higher vehicle utilization rates, and lower vehicle ownership rates, we expect a consumer shift towards acceptance of car-sharing. Based on the results of the survey, we believe our platform is advantageous for the following reasons:

● | Passive Income: We often match Owners with long term Drivers, which provides the Owners with a steady source of passive income resulting from our seamless re-booking process. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Insurance: Liability policy fills the gaps left by personal and ride-sharing policies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Review of Drivers: Drivers must pass our extensive background checks and most Drivers have also passed the Uber and Lyft background checks. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insurance Coverage
 
A key component to our business is our commercial auto. The two-sided nature of our platform means that we need to insure both the Driver and the Owner. Prior to any rental the Driver and Owner are provided an insurance ID card that lists the driver’s name and the vehicle identification number. Insurance is typically generated twenty-four hours in advance of the commencement of the rental through to when the Owner confirms drop-off of the rented vehicle by the Driver. The vehicle pick-up and drop-off is all managed through our platform. An Owner takes pictures of his or her vehicle prior to pressing the “Confirm Pick-up” button on the HyreCar mobile app. (If pictures are not taken and the button is not pressed, it provides grounds for a claim denial; subsequent liability and/or physical damage rests solely on the Driver and Owner.) After the rental is completed, the Owner presses the “Confirm Drop-off” button on the HyreCar mobile app and the rental ends.
 
American Business Insurance Services (“ABI”) is our insurance broker and Y Risk is our mobility-focused managing general underwriter. Y Risk was sold by our incumbent insurance company American International Group (NYSE: AIG) to The Hartford (NYSE: HIG) in December 2018, and we are in the process of moving our annual car insurance policy with The Hartford for the plan year from April 2019 to March 2020 under superior pricing and terms. ABI handles all of our back-end insurance generation and processing through a seamless ABI connection with HyreCar databases. ABI is a top broker in the United States for the Taxi and Livery business. Mr. David Haley, president of ABI, sits on our strategic advisory board.
 
For insurance purposes a vehicle rental is broken into four distinct driving periods. Period 0 is when the Driver has picked a vehicle up from the Owner and is driving with the Uber or Lyft app turned-off. Period 1 is when the Driver has the Uber or Lyft app turned-on, but has not yet accepted a fare. Period 2 is when the Driver has accepted a fare and is on the way to pick-up a passenger. Period 3 is when a passenger is in the vehicle. The HyreCar policy is specifically written to cover periods in which the Drivers are operating HyreCar vehicles OFF the Uber or Lyft platform (period 0). During the periods when Drivers are operating ON the Uber or Lyft platform (periods 1, 2 and 3), the HyreCar insurance subordinates to state mandated insurance provided by Uber and Lyft. This enables us to keep insurance costs and liability low by leveraging state mandated insurance policies provided by the TNCs.

Business Structure and Strategy
 
We operate out of our corporate office in Los Angeles, California. Our technology platform allows for a relatively small staff compared to the size and reach of our business. For example, we operate in all 50 U.S. States and the District of Columbia with no physical presence in those states, with the exception of California. Our business structure is divided into three distinct departments: General & Administrative, Sales and Marketing, and Technology.
 
Sales and Marketing are vital to our future profitability and growth. Most of our customers need to be sold into a car because they are initially reluctant to pay upfront fees. Early interactions with our customers indicated that if customers were walked through the process once by a member of our sales and marketing team, the customers were more inclined to use and continue to use our services for a longer period of time. Accordingly, we implemented a one-man sales team in May 2016 and our revenue rose 93% that month from the prior month. Since then, building a strong sales team has become a priority.
 
We have expanded the sales team to a total of 33 employees, including 3 managers, which are divided into a Driver team and an Owner team. The Driver team has a total of 16 sales agents who are split into six sub-teams. Driver team members make approximately 100 calls a day to new customer leads with a mandate to facilitate drivers into cars via the HyreCar platform. The Owner team has a total of 14 sales agents split evenly into the following three regions: west coast states, central states and east coast states. The Owner sales team’s primary objective is to get Owners to list their cars on the HyreCar platform. As the sales team has become more efficient as we have scaled, we don’t expect the need to add headcount as rapidly through 2019 in order for us to continue to achieve forecasted revenue growth rates.
 
Leveraging headcount more efficiently is a key assumption that we believe drives profitability. The ability to grow topline revenue without significant increases to operating expense is achieved through a combination of marketing, sales, support and technology. Attribution of organic bookings is directly related to the quality of marketing leads generated and user interface/experience enhancements (UI/UX) per technology development. The company’s expectation is that both aspects contribute to low operating expense growth in relation to revenue, which in-turn, the company believes, will lead to higher gross profit in 2019.
 
We currently operate with one technology development team in the United States including multiple full-time developers based out of our home office in Los Angeles, who are supplemented by one overseas development team in Cambodia. These teams are tasked with maintaining the current site, addressing bugs in the current code base and small improvements to the Owner and Driver application and website design.
 
Support and operations underpin the company. Insurance claims management, Owner payment resolutions, Driver payment resolutions, collections, chat support, email support, phone support, late rentals, car recovery, Driver verifications, insurance generation and insurance verification all work together to create what we believe is a “best in class” customer service experience. Currently, we have 30 in-house customer support staff. Our plan is to build a domestic support team that is client-facing and potentially scale by outsourcing as we grow. We believe that customer service is critical to our goal of bringing new Drivers/Owners onto the platform and retaining those customers who have already utilized our services.
 
Revenue Model
 
We generate revenue by taking a fee out of each rental processed on our platform. Each rental transaction represents a Driver renting a car from an Owner. Drivers pay a weekly rental rate, plus direct insurance costs and a 10% HyreCar fee. Owners receive their weekly rental rate minus a 15% HyreCar fee. For example, as of December 31, 2018, the average daily rental rate of a HyreCar vehicle is approximately $36.00 (“Daily Rental”), plus a 10% HyreCar fee ($3.60) and daily direct insurance fee of $13.00, totals $52.60 in total daily gross billings. 85% of the weekly rental or $30.60 or is transferred to the Owner. HyreCar earns revenues from the two revenue share fees and the insurance totaling $22.00 per day. Accordingly, the GAAP reportable revenue recognized by HyreCar is $22.00 in this example transaction (as detailed in the table below).

Daily Rental | $ | 36.00 | 
-----------------------+---+-------+----------------------
HyreCar Driver Fee | $ | 3.60 | (10% of Daily Rental)
Insurance | $ | 13.00 | 
HyreCar Gross Billings | $ | 52.60 | 
Owner Payment | $ | 30.60 | (85% of Daily Rental)
HyreCar Revenue | $ | 22.00 | (HyreCar Net Revenue)

Gross billings is an important measure by which we evaluate and manage our business. We define gross billings as the amount billed to Drivers, without any adjustments for amounts paid to Owners or refunds. It is important to note that gross billings is a non-GAAP measure and as such, is not recorded in our financial statements as revenue. However, we use gross billings to asses our business growth, scale of operations and our ability to generate gross billings is strongly correlated to our ability to generate revenues. Gross billings may also be used to calculate net revenue margin, defined as the company’s GAAP reportable revenue over gross billings. Using the definition of net revenue margin and the example above, HyreCar’s net revenue margin is equal to approximately 43.2% ($9,777,079 HyreCar’s GAAP revenue over $22,645,941 million Total Gross Billings). A breakout of revenue components is provided in MD&A and financial footnotes.
 
Marketing Plan
 
Our marketing team periodically reviews keyword searches using Google Analytics. Thirty keywords and phrases were chosen and analyzed, allowing the team to determine in which cities the persons searching for the keywords and phrases were located. For example, approximately 400,000 people in Los Angeles googled key words like, “rent a car for Uber,” “Uber,” and “Uber Leasing.” Overlaying our customer demographics with the Google search results created a Driver/Owner affinity population of approximately 25 million potential customers, with the bulk of the 25 million concentrated in 16 core geographic locations. Core geographies represent the top 16 metropolitan statistical areas, or MSAs, in the country based off population count.
Insurance Opportunity
 
A large percentage of our cost of revenues is direct insurance expense, which we pay to the insurance company. The premiums are broken into two categories, liability insurance and physical damage. The unique nature of our insurance enables us to keep insurance costs and liability low by leveraging state mandated insurance policies provided by the TNCs. Our insurance premiums have exceeded liability and physical damage claims throughout 2018, we are in the process of reviewing coverage options for our policy renewal in April and may pursue self-insurance options.
 
Current estimates are that in excess of 35% of all commercial property and casualty premiums are in some form of alternative risk structure. We have explored many forms of alternative risk structures including self-insurance through captive insurance programs and policies. Specifically, cell captives are entities consisting of a core and an indefinite number of cell entities which are kept legally separate from each other. A captive or protected cell is an ideal mechanism to deal with a large number of self-insured retention(s). The benefits of having a cell captive include:
 

● | generating a financial return through participating in the risk; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increased control over potential insurance coverage and costs; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | illustrating to a carrier the willingness to share in the risk; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | creating more stability in the insurance program. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on a 2018 feasibility study into the benefits of insurance captives and ongoing examination of our historical loss runs, we believe that we will be able to cut direct insurance costs by approximately 30% from 2017 premium levels. A potential 30% reduction in annualized premiums is a significant cost savings that increases the company’s gross profit margin and we believe it will contribute to company profitability in 2019. The company estimates some form of insurance cost savings will be in-place by the second quarter of 2019. To the extent the company offers insurance directly, then the company will disclosure any related revenues on the face of its income statements, in related notes and in the MD&A section of the company’s periodic reports.
 
In addition to self-insurance, the company is also working with our Managing General Agent (“MGA”) to develop new and innovative insurance products. The company has proposed a new type of owner “lay-up” insurance and higher insurance level for fleet vehicle owners on the HyreCar platform. Lay-up insurance replaces the need for an owner’s personal auto insurance policy and would represent significant cost savings when compared to other insurance options available in the market today. Offering this type of insurance product benefits the company in multiple verticals, including reduced insurance claim expense, greater customer retention and stickiness to the HyreCar platform. Our MGA has begun piloting lay-up insurance to vehicle owners.
 
Regulation
 
The California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) was the first state regulatory body to impose rules and guidelines for ride-sharing in the United States. The CPUC designated Uber and Lyft as “transportation network companies” or TNCs. The CPUC guidelines became the standard for all states across the U.S. Most states have adopted some form of the guidelines. California is one of the strictest states when it comes to regulating the TNCs. Our insurance works within the California guidelines which makes it easily adoptable by future state mandates outside of California.
 
Changes in government regulation of our business have the potential to materially alter our business practices or our operational results. Depending on the jurisdiction, those changes may come about through the issuance of new laws and regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations by a court, regulatory body or governmental official. Sometimes those changes may have not just prospective but also retroactive effect; this is particularly true when a change is made through reinterpretation of laws or regulations that have been in effect for some time. Moreover, changes in regulation that may seem neutral on their face may have either more or less impact on us than on ride-sharing businesses, depending on the circumstances. Potential changes in law or regulation that may affect us relate to insurance intermediaries, customer privacy, data security and rate regulation.
 
In addition, our operations also could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations. We are not aware of any current proposal to impose such a regime in the U.S. or internationally. Such a regime could, however, be quickly imposed if there was a serious disruption in the fuel supply for any reason, including an act of war, terrorist incident or other problem, such as the devastation caused by hurricane Harvey, affecting the petroleum supply, refining, distribution or pricing.
