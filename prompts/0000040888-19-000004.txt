We currently are in the process of seeking zoning changes and other governmental approvals on our excess real estate assets to optimize their value. 
The year of our subsidiary, Aerojet Rocketdyne, ends on the last Saturday in December. As a result of the 2016 calendar, Aerojet Rocketdyne had 53 weeks of operations in 2016 compared with 52 weeks of operations in 2018 and 2017. The additional week of operations, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016, accounted for $32.2 million in additional net sales. 
We were incorporated in Ohio in 1915 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware on April 11, 2014. Our principal executive offices are located at 222 N. Pacific Coast Highway, Suite 500, El Segundo, California 90245.
Our Internet website address is www.AerojetRocketdyne.com. We have made available through our Internet website, free of charge, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials were electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. We also make available on our Internet website our corporate governance guidelines and the charters for each of the following committees of our Board of Directors: Audit; Corporate Governance & Nominating; and Organization & Compensation.

Pacific Coast Highway, Suite 500, El Segundo, California 90245). 
Aerospace and Defense 
Aerojet Rocketdyne is a world-recognized technology-based engineering and manufacturing company that develops and produces specialized propulsion systems, as well as armament systems. We develop and manufacture all four propulsion types (liquid, solid, air-breathing, and electric) for space, defense, civil and commercial applications. Principal customers and end users include the DoD (including the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, Missile Defense Agency, and U.S. Navy), NASA, The Boeing Company ("Boeing"), Lockheed Martin Corporation ("Lockheed Martin"), Raytheon Company ("Raytheon"), and United Launch Alliance ("ULA"). 
For over 70 years, we have demonstrated a legacy of successfully meeting the most challenging missions by producing some of the world’s most technologically advanced propulsion systems that are aligned with our nation's critical needs. We believe Aerojet Rocketdyne maintains a unique competitive position due to a strategic focus on creating and maintaining a broad spectrum of propulsion and energetic products assisted by the growing market demand for its innovative energy management technologies. The highly reliable nature of our revenue comes from the long-term nature of the programs with which we are involved, our attractive contract base and our deep customer relationships. High renewal rates, supported by our market leading technology provide us with a highly stable business base from which to grow. As of December 31, 2018, our remaining performance obligations, also referred to as backlog, totaled $4.1 billion and our funded backlog, which includes only amounts for which funding has been authorized by a customer and a purchase order has been received, totaled $1.9 billion.

Primary Markets and Programs 
The markets and key programs we serve are: 
Aerospace. We specialize in the development and production of propulsion and power systems for space applications. Our products include a broad market offering of both electric and chemical propulsion (liquid propellant engines and solid rocket motors) required for launch vehicle and in-space applications supporting defense, civil and commercially based missions.
Our space launch products have a long, successful flight heritage with the DoD and NASA where we continue to project strong support related to National Security Space requirements enabling communications, navigation, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. We provide booster and upper stage propulsion for ULA’s Delta IV launch vehicle and upper stage propulsion for the Atlas V ("Atlas") launch vehicle in support of the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle ("EELV") program, as well as a limited number of Delta II vehicles which are supporting commercial customers launching Earth Observation spacecraft. In 2018, we announced contract awards associated with two new rocket development efforts for the U.S. government and commercial customers that assure the continued flight of our RL-10 cryogenic upper stage engine, providing more than 50 years of flight heritage. 
During 2018, we continued to make progress in moving toward first launch of NASA’s Space Launch System ("SLS"). An inventory of 16 flight-ready RS-25 main engines are nearly complete and include newly upgraded flight controller to support the first four flights of the heavy-lift rocket. In parallel, we are modernizing our RS-25 components and preparing for production of the next generation of RS-25 engines. 
We achieved several successful milestones in 2018 supporting NASA’s scientific programs. Every phase of NASA’s Mars InSight lander’s journey to the red planet was supported by our products. All eight successful landings on Mars have relied on our propulsion. We also provided all 28 rocket engines on OSIRIS-REx, the asteroid sample-return probe that recently arrived at Asteroid Bennu. In addition to powering the launch vehicle’s main and second stages, we are providing critical in-space propulsion. Our thrusters enabled braking maneuvers to support the arrival, and will maneuver the spacecraft during its year of close-proximity science operations, and enable its journey back to Earth’s orbit. Also, NASA’s Parker Solar Probe, launched with our RS-68A and RL-10 engines, is using our propulsion system to enable the probe’s 7-year journey to within 6.2 million kilometers of the Sun’s surface - eight times closer than the previous record.
We continued to mature critical technologies for our nation’s next generation of advanced hydrocarbon engines for future high-performance booster systems with the ability to eliminate the U.S. dependence on Russian-provided booster systems for National Security Space Launches. In February 2016, pursuant to an Other Transaction Agreement ("OTA"), the U.S. Air Force selected Aerojet Rocketdyne and ULA to share in a public-private partnership to develop jointly the AR1 engine under an agreement valued at $804.0 million with the U.S. Air Force investing two-thirds of the funding required to complete development of the AR1 engine by December 2019. In June 2018, the Company and the U.S. Air Force signed a modification to the existing OTA to modify the scope, funding, cost share, and period of performance of the AR1 engine. The modified OTA is valued at $353.8 million with the U.S. Air Force investing five-sixths of the funding required to design, build, and assemble a single AR1 engine prototype by December 2019. 
A subset of our key space programs include: RL-10, RS-68, and RS-25 engines/boosters that power EELV launch vehicles, propulsion for the Orion human space capsule and the Starliner Commercial Crew Transportation Capability capsule, AR1, and multiple in-space electric and chemical propulsion systems to provide orbit raising and satellite station positioning.
Defense. We specialize in the development and production of propulsion systems for defense applications including both solid and liquid propellant based systems, along with air-breathing (ramjet) systems for missile applications. The majority of these systems are the primary axial propulsion for missile systems. The breadth of our products includes tactical missiles, missile defense boosters and large solid-propellant boosters for a variety of applications. 
We also develop and manufacture liquid and solid divert and attitude control ("DACs") propulsion systems for missile defense applications. These are complex systems that provide multi-directional thrust and variable thrust levels to steer or control an intercept missile. Additionally, we develop and manufacture post-boost propulsion systems for strategic missiles. These systems provide directional control for critical missile defense interceptors and for ground and sea-based strategic missiles.
We also design, develop, and produce warhead/lethality systems for tactical missiles. Our tactical armament products have been successfully fielded on multiple active U.S. and international weapon system platforms.
During 2018, we continued to expand our strong legacy propulsion franchises on the Standard Missile, Patriot Advanced Capability-3 ("PAC-3"), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense ("THAAD") and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System ("GMLRS") missile propulsion systems. These franchise programs all experienced backlog growth during 2018, and continue to be globally deployed in support of U.S. and allied armed forces.
As part of our continuing Competitive Improvement Program, we built on the 2017 validation of activity to move energetic production of the Standard Missile-3 DACs and THAAD Boost Motor from our Sacramento, California facility to our Orange County, Virginia, and Camden, Arkansas, facilities. In 2018, we completed facility construction of a new Advanced Manufacturing Facility in Huntsville, Alabama, that will produce high-value non-energetic sub-assemblies for Standard Missile and THAAD; completing the transition of defense manufacturing out of the Sacramento facility. These production consolidation activities help to reduce costs and strengthen competitiveness.
In the advanced programs business arena, we initiated a full-scale engineering development of the advanced air-launched ("AAL") propulsion system that will transition to production. In the hypersonic propulsion technology area, we were competitively 
2

selected for multiple key missile propulsion development programs including: Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon ("HCSW") with Lockheed Martin and Operational Fires ("OpFires") with the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ("DARPA"). Both of these systems use conventional solid rocket motors to achieve hypersonic missile velocities. Our work on complementary air-breathing propulsion (ramjet / scramjet) for hypersonic missile continued in 2018 with significant hardware testing and maturation.
Finally, our Aerojet Rocketdyne Coleman Aerospace ("Coleman") business successfully completed development of the medium-range ballistic missile ("MRBM") target that is C-17 aircraft deployed. The initial deployment of an inert MRBM system from a C-17 occurred in early 2019. Coleman also continued to expand its scope on the Missile Defense MRBM missile target program.
A subset of our key defense programs include: Boosters and Solid DACs for the Navy’s Standard Missile family, Booster and Liquid DACs for THAAD, PAC-3, GMLRS, Redesigned Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle ("RKV") Liquid DACs, Stinger, Javelin, Tactical Tomahawk, Army TACMs, Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wire-guided warhead, and HAWK.
Information concerning the percentage of net sales attributable to our significant programs appears in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption "Major Customers." 
Competition 
The competitive dynamics of our multi-faceted marketplace vary by product line and customer, but we experience many of the same influences felt by the broader aerospace and defense industry. The large majority of products we manufacture are highly complex, technically sophisticated and extremely hazardous to build, demanding rigorous manufacturing procedures and highly specialized manufacturing equipment. While historically these factors, posed substantial barriers to entry, modern design tools and manufacturing techniques (such as additive manufacturing) available to new entrants with the ability to self-fund start-up as well as development costs has led to increased competition in aerospace markets. To date, competition from new entrants has been limited to a few participants who tend to be narrowly focused on products that are sub-elements of our overall product portfolio. For example, entrepreneurs such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, who have been or are in the process of developing liquid fuel propulsion capabilities are primarily focused on the development of space propulsion systems for heavy lift launch vehicles and are not pursuing or participating in the missile defense or tactical propulsion products that make up a substantial portion of our overall business. These new entrepreneurs have signaled their intent to compete primarily on price and are therefore bringing pressure to bear on existing cost paradigms and manufacturing methodologies.
The following table lists the primary participants in the propulsion market (in alphabetical order): 
Company | Parent | Propulsion Type 
Aerojet Rocketdyne | Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. | Solid, liquid, air-breathing, electric
Airbus Defence and Space (formerly Astrium) | Airbus Group | Solid, liquid 
Avio | Avio S.p.A | Solid, liquid 
Blue Origin LLC | Blue Origin | Liquid 
Electron Technologies, Inc. | L-3 Communications Corporation | Electric 
General Dynamics OTS | General Dynamics | Solid 
Moog Inc. | Moog Inc. | Liquid, electric 
Nammo Talley | Nammo Talley | Solid 
Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems | Northrop Grumman Corporation ("Northrop") | Solid, liquid, air-breathing 
Safran | Safran | Solid, liquid 
SpaceX | SpaceX | Liquid 

Industry Overview 
Our primary aerospace and defense customers include the DoD and its agencies, NASA, and the prime contractors that supply products to these customers. Our backlog depends, in large part, on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we are involved. These funding levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but rather follow the cycle of general public policy and political support for this type of funding. Moreover, although our contracts will be performed over a period of several years, the U.S. Congress must appropriate funds for a given program and the U.S. President must sign into law such appropriations legislation each government fiscal year ("GFY") that may significantly increase, decrease or eliminate, funding for a program. A decrease in DoD and/or NASA expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a material program in which we are or hope to be involved, or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government outlays, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.
In September 2018, the U.S. President signed into law H.R. 6157, which included two full-year appropriations bills for GFY 2019: (i) the DoD Appropriations Act and (ii) the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. For Defense, the bill, now Public Law 115-245, includes $606.5 billion in base budget funding and $67.9 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. On February 15, 2019, the U.S. President signed legislation to fund several U.S. government agencies, including NASA.

 The SLS appears to remain a top Congressional priority as the CR included a provision to allow NASA the funding flexibility for SLS and deep exploration to remain on track. The SLS program also has enjoyed wide, bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress. We maintain a strong relationship with NASA and our propulsion systems have been powering NASA launch vehicles and spacecraft since the inception of the U.S. space program. Our booster, upper stage and Orion vehicle propulsion systems are currently baselined on the new SLS vehicle and both upper stage and booster engines are in development for future SLS variants. Due to the retirement of the space shuttle fleet, U.S. astronauts have been dependent on Russian Soyuz flights for access to and from the International Space Station ("ISS") for the better part of this decade. NASA has been working to re-establish U.S. manned space capability as soon as possible through development of a new "space taxi" to ferry astronauts and cargo to the ISS. In 2014, Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner capsule, powered by Aerojet Rocketdyne propulsion, was selected by NASA to transport astronauts to and from the ISS. As Boeing’s business partner, Aerojet Rocketdyne will be providing the propulsion system for this new capsule, thereby supplementing its work for NASA on the SLS designed for manned deep space exploration. In both instances, we have significant propulsion content and we look forward to supporting these programs for NASA.
Major Customers 
Information concerning major customers appears in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption "Major Customers." 
Contract Types 
Research and development contracts are awarded during the early stages of a program’s development. Production contracts provide for the production and delivery of mature products for operational use. Aerojet Rocketdyne’s contracts are largely categorized as either "fixed-price" (largely used by the U.S. government for production-type contracts) or "cost-reimbursable" (largely used by the U.S. government for development-type contracts). During 2018, approximately 63% of our net sales were from fixed-price contracts and 37% from cost-reimbursable contracts. 
Fixed-price contracts are typically (i) firm fixed-price, (ii) fixed-price-incentive fee, or (iii) fixed-price level of effort contracts. For firm fixed-price contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne performs work for a fixed price and realizes all of the profit or loss resulting from variations in costs during contract performance. For fixed-price-incentive fee contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne receives increased or decreased fees (or profits) based upon actual performance against established targets or other criteria. For fixed-price level of effort contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne generally receives a structured fixed price per labor hour, dependent upon the customer’s labor hour needs. All fixed-price contracts present the risk of unreimbursed cost overruns potentially resulting in lower than expected contract profit margin and losses. 
Cost-reimbursable contracts are typically (i) cost plus fixed fee, (ii) cost plus incentive fee, or (iii) cost plus award fee contracts. For cost plus fixed fee contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne typically receives reimbursement of its costs, to the extent the costs are allowable under contractual and regulatory provisions, in addition to receiving a fixed fee. For cost plus incentive fee contracts and cost plus award fee contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne receives adjustments to the contract fee, within designated limits, based on actual results as compared with contractual targets for factors such as cost, performance, quality, and schedule. 
In addition, OTA contracts are becoming more prevalent in the developmental stages of U.S. government procurements. An OTA is a special vehicle used by federal agencies for obtaining or advancing research and development or prototypes. The U.S. government's procurement regulations and certain procurement statutes do not apply to OTAs, and accordingly, other transaction authority gives agencies the flexibility necessary to develop agreements tailored to a particular transaction. Our sales and backlog figures do not include work we have under contracts obligated by the customer under an OTA as our share of the contract costs are recognized as company-funded research and development. 
Government Contracts and Regulations 
U.S. government contracts generally are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations ("FAR"), agency-specific regulations that supplement FAR, such as the DoD’s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to U.S. government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustments, mandatory disclosure, and audit requirements. Our failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, inability to bill and collect receivables from customers, and the assessment of penalties and fines that could lead to suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting. In addition, as a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to routine audits, reviews, and investigations by the Defense Contract Audit Agency ("DCAA"), the Defense Contract Management Agency, and other similar U.S. government agencies. Such reviews include but are not limited to our contract performance, compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards as well as the review of the adequacy of our accounting systems, purchasing systems, property management systems, estimating systems, earned value management systems, and material management and accounting systems. 
The U.S. government’s ability to unilaterally modify or terminate a contract or to discontinue funding for a particular program at any time could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows. The cancellation of a contract, if terminated for cause, could also subject us to liability for the excess costs incurred by the U.S. government in procuring undelivered items from another source. If terminated for convenience, our recovery of costs would be limited to amounts already incurred or committed (including severance costs for terminated employees), and our profit would be limited based on the work completed prior to termination. 
Additional information about the risks relating to government contracts and regulations appears in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Report.

Backlog 
Information concerning backlog appears in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption "Backlog." 
Seasonality 
Aerojet Rocketdyne’s business is not subject to predictable seasonality. Primary factors affecting the timing of our sales include the timing of U.S. government awards, the availability of U.S. government funding, contractual product delivery requirements, and customer acceptances. 
Research and Development ("R&D")
We view R&D efforts as critical to maintaining our leadership position in markets in which we compete. Our R&D is primarily supported by customer funding. 
Our company-funded R&D efforts include expenditures for technical activities that are vital to the development of new products, services, processes or techniques, as well as those expenses for significant improvements to existing products or processes. 
The following table summarizes our R&D expenditures: 
 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
 | (In millions) 
Customer-funded | $ | 591.6 | | | $ | 561.1 | | $ | 513.0
Company-funded | 46.7 | | | 44.6 | | | 43.0
Total R&D expenditures | $ | 638.3 | | | $ | 605.7 | | $ | 556.0

Suppliers and Raw Materials 
The national aerospace supply base continues to consolidate due to economic, environmental, and marketplace circumstances beyond our control. The loss of key qualified suppliers of technologies, components, and materials can cause significant disruption to our program performance and cost. 
 Availability of raw materials and supplies has been generally sufficient. We sometimes are dependent, for a variety of reasons, upon sole-source or qualified suppliers and have, in some instances in the past, experienced difficulties meeting production and delivery obligations because of delays in delivery or reliance on such suppliers. Further, as a U.S. government contractor, we are often limited to procuring materials from certain suppliers capable of meeting rigorous customer and government specifications. 
Additional information about the risks relating to suppliers and raw materials appears in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Report. 
Intellectual Property 
Where appropriate, Aerojet Rocketdyne obtains patents in the U.S. and other countries for new and useful processes, machines, manufactures or compositions of matter, or any new and useful improvements thereof relating to its products and services. Our patents are maintained through the statutory limit of time, which is typically 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application, where the claimed invention has value in the markets in which we compete. We rely on trade secret protection for financial, technical and personnel information that provides an economic competitive advantage by virtue of not being known by the relevant public and ordinarily require employees to sign confidentiality agreements as a condition to employment. If properly protected, trade secrets can be maintained in perpetuity. Aerojet Rocketdyne takes reasonable steps to prevent disclosure of its trade secrets in order to maintain protection under applicable state and federal laws. As our products and services typically embody complex systems that include many technologies, we do not believe any single existing patent, license, or trade secret is material to our success.
Real Estate 
We own 11,394 acres of land adjacent to U.S. Highway 50 between Rancho Cordova and Folsom, California east of Sacramento ("Sacramento Land"). Acquired in the early 1950s and historically used for our aerospace and defense operations, large portions were used solely to provide safe buffer zones around hazardous operations. Modern changes in propulsion technology coupled with the relocation of our propulsion operations led us to determine large portions of the Sacramento Land were no longer needed for operations. Consequently, our plan has been to re-entitle the Sacramento Land for new uses and explore various opportunities to optimize its value.
The Sacramento Land is made up of 5,203 acres used for our aerospace and defense operations, 628 acres available for future entitlement, and 5,563 acres for future development under the brand name "Easton". Easton has 3,904 acres that are fully entitled. The term "entitlement" is generally used to denote the required set of regulatory approvals required to allow land to be zoned for new requested uses. Required regulatory approvals vary with each jurisdiction and each zoning proposal and may include permits, land use master plans, zoning designations, state and federal environmental documentation, and other regulatory approvals unique to the land. The entitlement and development process in California is long and uncertain with 
5

approvals required from various authorities, including local jurisdictions, and in select projects, permits required by federal agencies such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, and others prior to construction. 
As Easton continues to execute re-entitlement and pre-development activities, we are pursuing all monetization options and are exploring how to maximize value from Easton. Value creation and monetization may include outright land sales and/or joint ventures with real estate developers, residential builders, and/or other third parties. We believe the long-term prospect for the Sacramento region represents an attractive and affordable alternative to the San Francisco Bay Area and other large metropolitan areas of California. 
The following table summarizes the Sacramento Land (in acres): 

 | EnvironmentallyUnrestricted | EnvironmentallyRestricted (1) | | Total | Entitled
Glenborough and Easton Place | 1,043 | | 349 | | 1,392 | 1,392
Rio del Oro | 1,818 | | 491 | | 2,309 | 2,309
Westborough | 1,387 | | 272 | | 1,659 | — 
Hillsborough (2) | 51 | | 97 | | 148 | 148 
Office Park and Auto Mall | 47 | | 8 | | 55 | 55 
Total Easton acreage | 4,346 | | 1,217 | | 5,563 | 3,904
Operations land | 24 | | 5,179 | | 5,203 | 
Land available for future entitlement (3) | 386 | | 242 | | 628 | 
Total Sacramento Land | 4,756 | | 6,638 | | 11,394 | 

_________

(1) | Indicates land subject to restrictions imposed by state and/or federal regulatory agencies because of our historical propulsion system testing and manufacturing activities. We are actively working with the various regulatory agencies to have the restrictions removed as early as practicable, and the solutions to use these lands within Easton have been accounted for in the various land use plans and granted entitlements. See Note 8(c) in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for a discussion of the federal and/or state environmental restrictions affecting portions of the Sacramento Land.

(2) The remaining 148 acres designated in Hillsborough will be transferred, per the completed purchase and sale contract from 2015, when the required environmental remediation work is completed. 

(3) | We believe it will be several years before any of this excess Sacramento Land is available for future change in entitlement. Some of this excess land is outside the current Urban Services Boundary established by the County of Sacramento and all of it is far from existing infrastructure, making it uneconomical to pursue entitlement for this land at this time.

Leasing & Other Real Estate 
We currently lease approximately 0.5 million square feet of office space in Sacramento to various third parties. These leasing activities generated $6.4 million in revenue in 2018. 
We also own approximately 580 acres of land in Chino Hills, California. This property was used for the manufacture and testing of ordnance. With the sale of our ordnance business in the mid-1990s, we closed this facility and commenced clean-up of the site. We continue to work with state regulators and the City of Chino Hills to complete those efforts. 
Environmental Matters 
Our current and former business operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes. Our policy is to conduct our business with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. We continually assess compliance with these regulations, and we believe our current operations are materially in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Under existing U.S. environmental laws, Potentially Responsible Parties ("PRPs"), are jointly and severally liable, and therefore we are potentially liable to the U.S. government or other third parties for the full cost of remediating the contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites where we have been designated as a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or state environmental agencies. The nature of environmental investigation and cleanup activities requires significant management judgment to determine the timing and amount of any estimated future costs that may be required for remediation measures. Further, environmental standards change from time to time. However, we perform quarterly reviews of these matters and accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability, usually based on proportionate sharing, can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities have not been discounted to their present value as the amounts and timing of cash payments are not fixed or reliably determinable. 
On January 12, 1999, we reached a settlement agreement ("Global Settlement") with the U.S. government covering environmental costs associated with our Sacramento site and our former Azusa site. Pursuant to the Global Settlement, we can 
6

recover up to 88% of our environmental remediation costs through the establishment of prices for Aerojet Rocketdyne's products and services sold to the U.S. government. Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of the Electronics and Information Systems business in 2001, Aerojet Rocketdyne entered into an agreement with Northrop (the "Northrop Agreement") whereby Aerojet Rocketdyne is reimbursed by Northrop for a portion of environmental expenditures eligible for recovery under the Global Settlement, subject to an annual billing limitation of $6.0 million and a cumulative limitation of $189.7 million. 
Operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal, recurring part of operations. Most of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these future costs are allowed to be included in our contracts with the U.S. government. 
The inclusion of environmental costs in our contracts with the U.S. government impacts our competitive pricing; however, we believe that this impact is mitigated by driving improvements and efficiencies across our operations as well as our ability to deliver innovative and quality products to our customers.
We did not incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2018 nor do we anticipate any material capital expenditures in 2019 and 2020. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis in Part II, Item 7 "Environmental Matters" of this Report for additional information. 
Additional information on the risks related to environmental matters can be found under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this Report, including the material effects on compliance with environmental regulations that may impact our competitive position and operating results. 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, 12% of our 5,004 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees and unions are good.
