ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview
Envista is a global family of more than 30 trusted dental brands, including Nobel, Ormco, and Kerr united by a shared purpose: to partner with professionals to improve lives. We help our customers deliver the best possible patient care through industry-leading dental consumables, solutions, technology, and services. Our comprehensive portfolio, including dental implants and treatment options, orthodontics, and digital imaging technologies, covers a broad range of dentists' clinical needs for diagnosing, treating, and preventing dental conditions as well as improving the aesthetics of the human smile. With a foundation comprised of the proven Envista Business System (“EBS”) methodology, an experienced leadership team, and a strong culture grounded in continuous improvement, commitment to innovation, and deep customer focus, we are well equipped to meet the end-to-end needs of dental professionals worldwide. We are one of the largest global dental products companies, with significant market positions in some of the most attractive segments of the dental products industry. We serve more than a million dentists in over 140 countries through one of the largest commercial organizations in the dental products industry and through our dealer partners. In 2021, we generated total sales of $2.5 billion, of which approximately 82% were derived from sales of consumables, services and spare parts.
We were formed in 2018, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Danaher Corporation (“Danaher”), to serve as the ultimate parent company of the dental platform of Danaher. On September 20, 2019, we completed our initial public offering and on December 18, 2019, Danaher completed the disposition of its ownership interest in us. The transactions to separate the dental business from Danaher, as described here and elsewhere in this Annual Report, are referred to, collectively, as the “Separation.” For additional information regarding the Separation transactions, see Note 1 and Note 24 to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
We were built through the acquisition and integration of over 25 leading dental businesses and brands over the course of more than 15 years. Our core leadership team has been in place since 2016 and has over 200 collective years of dental market experience and we have over 11,000 employees to execute on our purpose to partner with professionals to improve lives. Since 2016, we have leveraged EBS to consolidate over ten operating companies into three operating companies, reduced our number of sites from over 230 to under 100, and significantly transformed our business. EBS is a set of lean, innovation, growth and leadership-focused tools and processes that differentiates us and underpins our competitive advantage. The application of EBS has reduced costs and business complexity, freeing up resources that we have invested in acquisitions, research and development for new product development focusing on implants, digital imaging and workflow solutions, aligners, and infection prevention as well as growing our direct sales infrastructure, especially in emerging markets (which we have historically defined as developing markets of the world, which prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, experienced extended periods of accelerated growth in gross domestic product and infrastructure, including Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia (with the exception of Japan and Australia)).
The Dental market has attractive secular drivers that we believe will drive growth for several years to come. These include the digitization of dental practices globally, which is transforming the way dentists diagnose and treat patients, leading to better clinical outcomes. In addition, we believe future growth in the dental industry will be driven by an aging population, the current under penetration of dental procedures, especially in emerging markets, improving access to complex procedures due to increasing technological innovation, an increasing demand for cosmetic dentistry, and the growth of Dental Service Organizations (“DSOs”), which are expected to drive increasing penetration and access to care globally. Orthodontics and implants both have less than 10% market penetration globally and are areas where we have a significant market presence. 
We are a leading dental provider in emerging markets. In 2021, we generated $549 million, or 22%, of our sales from emerging markets. Our growing scale in these markets has been driven by strategic investments in underpenetrated markets, such as the Greater China region, where we had sales of $258 million in 2021. We are also replicating key elements of our Greater China region strategy in other emerging markets to benefit from the future growth potential associated with expanding access to dental care in these regions.
Our commercial organization includes over 3,000 employees with deep clinical, product and workflow expertise who interact with customers on a daily basis. We are also a leading global provider of clinical training to enhance patient access to high-quality dental care, reaching over 400,000 dental professionals annually through more than 4,000 training and education events we directly organize. The majority of our training and education events were conducted online in 2020 and we reached a larger audience than in prior years. Through our trusted brands, innovative product offerings and comprehensive customer service, we have established strong relationships globally with key constituencies, including DSOs, dental specialists, general dentists, and dental laboratories. We believe the continuing expansion of our global commercial organization will provide us with significant opportunities for future growth as we increase our penetration in various geographic markets.
Innovation is a core part of our strategy and we believe that our research and development expenditure of approximately $320 million since 2019 was one of the highest R&D spends in the dental products industry. We target our R&D efforts to address customers’ unmet needs and our commercial scale gives us deep insight into all fields of dentistry. Through our investments in R&D, we have accelerated multiple new product development initiatives, such as the DTX software suite, the N1TM implant system, and SparkTM clear aligners, each of which is discussed in more detail below.
Our business is operated through two segments: Specialty Products & Technologies, which is comprised of our Implants and Orthodontics businesses, and Equipment & Consumables, which is comprised of our Imaging and Consumables businesses.

Specialty Products & Technologies
Our Specialty Products & Technologies segment develops, manufactures and markets dental implant systems, dental prosthetics, regenerative materials, and associated treatment software and technologies, as well as orthodontic bracket systems, aligners and lab products. We typically market these products directly to end-users through our commercial organization, and 87% of our 2021 sales for this segment were direct sales. In 2021, our Specialty Products & Technologies segment generated $1.5 billion of sales, representing year-over-year sales and core sales increase of 34.9% and 33.0%, respectively. In 2021, 44% of segment sales were derived from North America, 24% from Western Europe, 7% from other developed markets, and 25% from emerging markets. Sales of consumables, services and spare parts comprised 94% of segment sales in 2021. This segment is comprised of our Implants and Orthodontics businesses and includes the Nobel, Ormco, Spark, Implant Direct, Alpha Bio Tec, and Orascoptic brands among others. 
Equipment & Consumables
Our Equipment & Consumables segment develops, manufactures and markets dental equipment and supplies used in dental offices, including digital imaging systems and sensors, software and other visualization/magnification systems; endodontic systems and related consumables; restorative materials, rotary burs, impression materials, bonding agents and cements; and infection prevention products. In 2021, our Equipment & Consumables segment generated $1.0 billion of sales. In 2021, 66% of segment sales were derived from North America, 13% from Western Europe, 4% from other developed markets, and 17% from emerging markets. We distribute our Equipment & Consumables segment products primarily through our channel partners, representing approximately 86% of sales in this segment in 2021. This segment is comprised of our Imaging and Consumables businesses and includes the Kerr, Metrex, Dexis, i-CAT, and DTX brands among others. 
COVID-19 Impact
The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict because of the dynamic and evolving nature of the crisis. During 2020, our sales and results of operations were most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the first and second quarters with positive signs of recovery during the third and fourth quarters of 2020. During 2021, we continued to see positive signs of recovery in certain markets in which we operate, however, certain markets continue to be more adversely impacted than others. While the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines throughout 2021 mitigated mortality risk, new COVID-19 variants, particularly the Delta and Omicron variants, proved to remain a threat. The lifting of lockdowns in certain areas started a slow economic recovery. The resulting increase in consumer demand has created significant challenges for supply chains as a result of labor and raw material shortages. The majority of dental practices have reopened, however, overall patient volume remains below pre-COVID-19 levels. 
The severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the scope and duration of the pandemic, the rise of new variants, the extent and severity of the impact on our customers, the measures that have been and may be taken to contain the virus (including its various mutations) and mitigate its impact, U.S. and foreign government actions to respond to the reduction in global economic activity, our ability to continue to manufacture and source our products and to find suitable alternative products at reasonable prices, our ability to continue to ship and deliver our products in a cost-effective and timely manner, the impact of the pandemic and associated economic downturn on our ability to access capital if and when needed and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can continue, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts on our financial condition and results of operations.
Please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors--Risks Related to COVID-19 and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a more detailed discussion of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions, and the actual operational and financial impacts that we have experienced to date. 
Acquisitions and Divestitures
On December 22, 2021, we entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Carestream Dental Technology Parent Limited ("Carestream"), a private limited company registered in England and Wales, pursuant to which Carestream and certain of its subsidiaries (together with Carestream, the "Sellers") will sell to the Company the Sellers' intraoral scanner business (the "Intraoral Scanner Business") for total consideration of $600 million, subject to certain customary adjustments as provided in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement provides that, upon the terms and conditions set forth therein, the Company will purchase the Intraoral Scanner Business through the acquisition of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities, as well as the acquisition of the equity of certain subsidiaries of the Sellers (the "IOS Acquisition"). The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022. Additionally, on December 31, 2021, we closed the divestiture of our KaVo Treatment Unit and Instrument Business (the “Divestiture”). With the Divestiture and the pending IOS Acquisition, we continue to make significant progress toward our long-term goal of transforming our product portfolio towards higher growth and higher margin segments of dentistry. 
Restructuring Activities
We implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to execute our strategy, streamline operations, take advantage of available capacity and resources and to adjust our cost structure. For additional information regarding our restructuring activities, please refer to Note 20 to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
History
We were built through the acquisition and integration of over 25 leading dental businesses and brands over the course of more than 15 years. We believe our business today has one of the most comprehensive offerings in the dental products industry. We organize our operating companies in a way that leverages long histories of brand leadership across their respective product categories. We initiated business realignment efforts starting in 2016, which has helped improve alignment of our product and commercial strategies, allowing us to better meet the needs of a broad set of customers, and facilitates an efficient and effective innovation pipeline.
Our Strategy
Our strategic focus is comprised of three key elements, which are based on the EBS strategic areas of Lean, Innovation, Growth and Leadership.
◦“Establish a Strong Foundation”: We have been successful in the past in driving continuous improvements and margin expansion through the application of EBS. Beginning in 2016, we consolidated our operating companies, substantially reduced our manufacturing sites, consolidated sales offices, streamlined our R&D organization, and centralized our direct and indirect procurement organizations. We simplified our portfolio by reducing the number of our imaging brands and exiting lower growth/margin businesses. In 2020, we also executed a $100 million structural cost reduction initiative. We continue to pursue a number of ongoing strategic initiatives across our operating companies relating to efficient sourcing and improvements in manufacturing and back-office support, all with a focus on continually improving quality, delivery, cost, growth and innovation.
◦“Reinvest for Growth”: Streamlining our business operations and reducing costs has allowed us to reposition ourselves to create a digital and consumable workflow-oriented portfolio. We have invested in our Specialty Products & Technology segment, adding manufacturing capacity and personnel to these businesses, with plans for further investment in 2022. We intend to drive shareholder value by deploying capital to acquire or invest in other businesses that strategically fit into or extend our product offering into new or attractive adjacent markets - the pending IOS Acquisition is an example of this strategy in action. We are planning to expand our clinical training and education infrastructure to further increase brand loyalty, deepen our relationships with dental practitioners and further enhance patient access to high quality dental care. We believe these investments better position us to effectively meet the needs of our customers, particularly the growing DSO segment, which values a comprehensive, end-to-end product offering with the ability to roll out new technologies and procedure-focused trainings at scale.
◦“Maintain and Pursue Long-Term Market Leadership”: As we seek to continue to improve our business and drive increased cash flow, we expect to strategically invest in innovation in order to better serve our customers and accelerate organic growth. We have invested significant resources in the following areas which we believe will help drive long-term market leadership:
•Digital Workflow: We have developed our Diagnostic and Treatment Planning Software, DTX, to meet the growing demands for digital connectivity of dental practices. 
▪Specialty Products and Technologies: We have launched several new products in our Orthodontics business and approximately 20% of our sales in this area are from products launched in the past 3 years. In 2020, we expanded capacity for our Spark clear aligners and added over 1,000 new employees to our Orthodontics business. Our R&D expenditures in our Implants business accelerated the development of new implant systems such as N1. We will continue to invest in our global commercial footprint and product innovation to grow our strong position in the Implant and Orthodontics markets, both of which are underpenetrated.
▪Emerging Markets: We are one of the largest dental product providers in the Greater China region with R&D, product management, operations, regulatory affairs, sales and marketing, and customer service resources. We have built a business that generated less than $30 million in sales in 2011 to one that generated $258 million in sales in 2021. We expect to continue to invest in the Greater China region as we believe it will be a strong growth driver for our business in the future. We have succeeded in the Greater China region by harnessing our existing go-to-market infrastructure, building familiarity with local customer needs and regulations, and establishing dedicated locally-based management resources. We are replicating key elements of this strategy in other emerging regions, such as Latin America, Asia Pacific, Eastern Europe and Russia.
Our Industry
Within the global dental products industry, we believe segments such as Imaging, Implants and Orthodontics will grow at a more rapid pace than the overall market. We believe future growth of the dental products industry will be driven by an aging population, the current underpenetration of dental procedures, especially in emerging markets, improving access to complex procedures due to increasing technological innovation, an increasing demand for cosmetic dentistry, and growth of DSOs, which are expected to drive increasing penetration and access to care globally.
While both equipment and consumables represent significant expenditures for dental service providers, the sales dynamics for each differ. The sale of equipment depends on technological advancements, dentists’ willingness to invest in new technologies, opening of new offices and replacement demand. On the other hand, consumables are more dependent on patient volume. We believe large multi-category manufacturers that provide a broad portfolio of equipment and consumables have more recession-resilient product portfolios and can gain meaningful competitive advantage over their peers as larger customers increasingly seek package deals and consolidate suppliers, and digital dentistry adoption creates links between different products in the dental practitioners’ offices.
While the U.S. represents a significant portion of the global dental products industry, we have also been focused on building significant scale in emerging markets. Prevalence and penetration of treatments is largely tied to socio-economic factors such as availability and affordability of care. We expect improving economic conditions and increased consumer disposable income in emerging markets, as well as advancements in technological innovation that reduces complexity, cost and increases efficiency, will help drive penetration of dental care in these under-served markets.
Key Segments Within the Dental Products Industry
◦Imaging: Imaging (both x-ray and other visualization solutions) is considered the entry-point for many dental diagnostic exams and subsequent treatments. The rapid adoption of digital technologies in the imaging segment has transformed dental practices and has increased access to care as well as the quality of care delivered to patients. We believe enhanced connectivity amongst different types of dental imaging/diagnostic equipment and integration with downstream treatment planning and treatment delivery solutions will further improve dental workflows and lead to better treatment outcomes. We believe digitalization and connectivity will continue to drive high growth in this segment.
◦Implants: The implant industry is significant and enjoys higher margins and growth than the overall dental products market. The U.S. and the Greater China region represent key growth drivers for this industry. In the U.S., implant penetration far lags other developed markets such as Germany, Spain and Italy. In China, the prevalence of severe tooth loss is higher than in the U.S., while implant penetration is far below the U.S. We expect product innovation and increased affordability to help drive future growth in emerging markets.
◦Orthodontics: Traditional wires and brackets systems continue to be the preferred choice in complex and young adult cases, due to their better clinical outcomes. In recent years, clear aligners have become an increasingly popular treatment option and are expected to grow at a significantly faster pace than traditional metal wires and brackets. Clear aligners are aesthetically pleasing and clinically proven to be effective in less severe cases, which combined with technological advancements that have significantly increased the number of providers offering orthodontic treatments, have expanded the addressable market for orthodontic procedures. Going forward, we believe this product segment will continue to grow at a high pace as aesthetics become increasingly important to patients.
Growth Drivers
We believe that many product offerings in our core business are underpenetrated globally and present a significant opportunity for growth through the continued penetration of our differentiated products. Beyond our core business, there are also a number of adjacent dental products, which we believe provide an opportunity to further grow and expand our product offerings in the future.
We believe continued growth in both the global dental industry and global dental products market will be driven by a variety of factors, including:
◦An aging population. According to the United Nations, in 2017 there were nearly 1 billion people aged 60 or over in the world, comprising 13% of the global population. By 2050, that number is expected to double to approximately 2 billion people and comprise 22% of the world’s population, largely driven by aging in low and middle-income countries. With the aging of the population, prevalence of dental conditions, including edentulism (full tooth loss), dry mouth, root and coronal caries, and periodontitis, increases. As the global population continues to age, we believe older patients will help drive increased demand for dental products and services.
◦The current underpenetration of dental procedures, especially in emerging markets. According to the Global Economy and Development Working Paper 100 of the Brookings Institution, it is estimated that between 2015 and 2030, the middle class population in emerging markets will grow by approximately 2.4 billion people, from 2.0 billion to 4.4 billion. This major demographic shift is generating a large, new customer base with increased access to dental products and services along with the resources to pay for them. According to the World Health Organization, the number of dentists in China is approximately 45 per 100,000 people compared to 60 in the U.S. and 85 in Germany. The expansion of training opportunities for dental professionals in emerging markets is also leading to increased patient awareness and access to premium dental products and procedures, further facilitating the market’s growth.
◦Improving access to complex procedures due to increasing technological innovation. The market for digital dental solutions has grown substantially in recent years due to increased demand from dentists and dental professionals for increased efficiency and better product workflows, with rapid adoption of these technologies not only in the U.S. and Europe, but also in emerging markets. Digital dental solutions enhance the workflow of dentists from diagnostics to treatment. Providing better diagnostics allows dentists to more effectively treat patient needs, often at lower cost. Beyond diagnostics, digital dental solutions are also increasingly being utilized in implant, orthodontic and restorative treatment planning. This simplifies case planning and execution, which is especially relevant for newer dentists as technology helps to de-skill complex procedures and increase outcome predictability.
◦An increasing demand for cosmetic dentistry. Increased awareness of the importance of oral health maintenance and increasing consumer focus on cosmetic dentistry continues to act as a meaningful growth driver for the global dental industry. Orthodontic procedures are increasingly aesthetically driven as evidenced by the rapid adoption of clear aligners. We believe aesthetically-driven patients seeking an increasing number of tooth replacement procedures and teeth straightening procedures will continue to drive the demand for dental implants and aligners.
◦Growth of DSOs, which are expected to drive increasing penetration and access to care globally. In the U.S. and globally, increasing demand for dental services has driven the growth of alternative care delivery networks. DSOs in the U.S. are focused on underserved markets where access to general as well as complex dental care is relatively underpenetrated. Globally, growth of private insurance as well as private provider networks provide access to more complex procedures that are not covered under social insurance. We believe the continued growth of these care delivery networks will increase demand for dental products and more complex procedures which require more advanced technologies.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe we have significant competitive strengths, including:
◦Brand leadership with a long track record and strong brand recognition. We built our business around brands with long histories of innovation and strong brand recognition in the dental products market. The founder of Nobel introduced the world’s first dental implant and Nobel has since become a world leader in the field of innovative implant-based dental restorations. Ormco has over 60 years of distinguished history providing orthodontists with high quality, innovative products. Multiple brands within our Imaging and Consumables businesses have more than 100 years of history in dental products. We believe the long history and leadership of our well-known brands in the dental products industry enhances our connections with both patients and providers and supports our strong market position.
◦Comprehensive portfolio with leadership in key attractive segments. We believe we have one of the most comprehensive offerings in the industry, enabling us to be a vendor of choice for many dental practitioners, dental laboratories, distributors and DSOs. The breadth and depth of our product offerings address a broad range of dentists’ clinical needs from consumables to digital equipment solutions. Our catalog of products covers the spectrum from value-focused products to premium brands, allowing providers to fully address patient needs in different market segments. Within our product portfolio, we believe we are one of the largest manufacturers in implants and orthodontics and have one of the largest installed bases of imaging devices. Our broad product offering positions us particularly well to serve the needs of DSOs, which have been one of the fastest growing segments of our customer base.
◦Global commercial reach. Our operating companies serve more than a million dentists in over 140 countries through one of the largest customer-facing sales teams in the dental products industry and through our dealer partners. In 2021, we generated 51% of our sales from markets outside of the U.S. We reach dentists via a network of over 1,000 global distribution partners. We believe our diverse sales channels, global manufacturing and distribution, and local market knowledge help us to better address customers’ needs. We are also a leading global provider of clinical training to enhance patient access to high-quality dental care.
◦Strong position in emerging markets, particularly in the Greater China region. Emerging markets represented 22% of our total sales in 2021. We have built one of the largest dental products businesses in the Greater China region, with three manufacturing operations and a fully localized infrastructure with dedicated R&D, product management, operations, regulatory affairs, sales and marketing, and customer service resources. With this structure, we believe that we are well positioned to capture additional share in the growing Chinese dental products industry. Given our success in the Greater China region, we are replicating key elements of this strategy in other high growth regions such as Latin America, Asia Pacific, Eastern Europe and Russia.
◦Track record of innovation. Our operating companies have a long track record of successful innovation, having pioneered many new dental product categories since their inception. Our strong commercial infrastructure allows us to obtain insights into unmet needs at the practitioner level and translate them into differentiated products. Our focus on innovation has yielded many differentiated products over the years, such as NobelActive dental implants, Damon bracket and wire system and i-CAT 3D imaging system. We are continuing this legacy of innovation with our N1 implant system, Spark clear aligners and DTX clinical software ecosystem. Our new product development activities are complemented by externally sourcing technologies through a broad network of partnerships, collaborations, and investments involving third-party research institutions, universities and innovative start-up companies.
◦Envista Business System. We believe our deep-rooted commitment to EBS helps drive our success and market leadership and differentiates us in the dental products industry. EBS encompasses not only lean tools and processes, but also methods for driving innovation, growth and leadership. Within the EBS framework, we pursue a number of ongoing strategic initiatives relating to streamlining business operations, portfolio simplification, reduction of costs, redeployment of resources, customer insight generation, product development and commercialization, efficient sourcing, and improvement in manufacturing and back-office support, all with a focus on continually improving quality, delivery, cost, growth and innovation.
◦Experienced management team with extensive dental industry experience. Our executive officer team has over 200 collective years of dental industry experience and a proven track record of applying EBS to execute on our strategic and operational goals. Under their leadership, we have undertaken a significant transformation to better position our business for organic and inorganic growth and diversify our sales globally. We believe our management team will continue to drive growth and profitability in our business in the future.

The table below describes the percentage of our total annual sales attributable to each of our segments over each of the three years ended December 31, 2021. For additional information regarding sales, operating profit and identifiable assets by segment, please refer to Note 23 in our audited consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019
Specialty Products & Technologies | 60% | 58% | 59% 
Equipment & Consumables | 40% | 42% | 41% 

Specialty Products & Technologies
Our Specialty Products & Technologies segment, including our Nobel and Ormco brands, develops, manufactures and markets dental implant systems, dental prosthetics and associated treatment software and technologies, as well as orthodontic bracket systems, aligners and lab products. We have a strong direct relationship with our customers through a sales force of more than 1,900 employees. In 2021, direct sales to end-users represented 87% of segment sales and sales from consumables, services and spare parts comprised 94% of segment sales. We believe strong industry fundamentals and new product introductions in this segment will continue to drive substantial growth for us.
Implant Solutions
Nobel is a world leader in the field of innovative implant-based dental restorations offering over 3,000 products and enabling dentists to deliver single-tooth to full-mouth restorations. As the pioneer of implant science grounded in clinical research, Nobel has introduced a number of solutions that have become widely adopted in the premium implant industry. Nobel’s comprehensive product offering includes dental implant systems, guided surgery systems, biomaterials, prefabricated and custom-built prosthetics. Nobel also offers a comprehensive education program to fully train its broad range of clinical customers, from clinicians performing basic implant procedures to the most advanced practitioners, with the goal of enhancing patient access to high-quality dental care. Customers of Nobel include oral surgeons, prosthodontists and periodontists. Other well-known implant brands in our portfolio include Alpha-Bio Tec, Implant Direct, Logon, and Nobel-ProceraTM.
The table below provides a summary description of key products and brands offered by our Implants business:
Our Implant brands have a long history of innovation, which include both the first documented case of a titanium implant placement in a human and introduction of the concept of living bone adhering to an artificial implant (known as osseointegration). Today, our Nobel brand offers several implant systems and is integrating them with the DTX suite of software applications described below. Currently, NobelActive is our top implant system in terms of sales and number of placements. NobelActive offers high primary stability allowing patients to receive and use prosthetics the same day as the implant is placed. The most recent example of Nobel’s innovation leadership is the N1 implant system, which was launched in Europe in 2020 and recently received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with authorization for sale in further regions pending, and which we believe will be a significant product for Nobel and will simplify the implant procedure. N1’s unique implant and site preparation method was created with the goal to reduce complexity and streamline workflows during implant and restorative procedures. Through our Implant Direct, Alpha-Bio Tec and Logon value implant businesses, we also offer a variety of implant systems that cover a broad range of price points in the market.
Since being acquired in 2014, Nobel has focused on reinvigorating its product offerings and has released over 30 new products. Among these are, the comprehensive software packages ‘DTX Studio Implant,’ which is used for treatment planning of dental implants, and ‘DTX Studio Lab,’ which is used for prosthetics treatment planning. These software packages are now integrated in our broader DTX software suite, which also includes the new ‘DTX Studio Clinic’ software package offered with our imaging devices. With DTX, clinicians can use one software ecosystem from image acquisition and diagnosis to treatment planning, implant surgery, and restoration planning and placement, as well as collaborate with treatment partners such as other dentists or laboratories on one digital platform. We believe this will enable significant clinical workflow efficiencies and more predictable clinical outcomes.
Orthodontic Solutions
For over 60 years, Ormco has provided orthodontic professionals with high quality, innovative products backed by educational support to enhance the lives of their patients.  Ormco is a leading manufacturer and provider of advanced orthodontic technology and services designed to move malpositioned teeth and jaws. Ormco products include brackets and wires, tubes and bands, archwires, clear aligners, digital orthodontic treatments, retainers, and other orthodontic laboratory products, and are marketed under the DamonTM, InsigniaTM, AOATM and SparkTM brands. Ormco also offers a comprehensive education system to fully train its clinical customers from basic to the most advanced, with the goal of enhancing patient access to high-quality dental care. Customers of Ormco are primarily orthodontists.
The table below provides a summary description of key products and brands offered by Ormco:
Ormco is a leader in passive self-ligating metal brackets, marketed as the Damon System. Passive self-ligation is a method of moving teeth using a fraction of the force levels required by brackets that utilize ligatures. In 2018, Ormco launched its next generation product, DQ2TM, which offers twice the rotational control as the predecessor bracket, allowing for optimal precision, predictability and efficiency. In 2018, Ormco launched Symetri™ Clear, an advanced aesthetic ceramic bracket designed for refined strength, patient comfort and easy debonding without fracturing. In 2019, Ormco launched SmartArch™, a patented laser-engineered archwire designed to enable clinicians to move into a finish wire after just two archwires, reducing treatment time.

Ormco also offers the Insignia digital orthodontic system as well as a variety of other orthodontic products, including twin brackets, clear brackets, wires and auxiliary components.
Having historically focused on brackets and wires, Ormco now has commercially launched its clear aligner system in several markets including North America, Europe, and China. Spark is a clear aligner system designed for mild to complex malocclusion that is made with TruGEN™ and TruGEN XR™, the latest generation of aligner material. It is designed to deliver higher sustained force retention for efficiency and a high level of transparency for aesthetics. Spark aligners are also designed with polished, scalloped edges to enhance patient comfort and minimize aligner stains. Over 2020 and 2021, Ormco announced a suite of upgrades to its Spark clear aligner Approver™ software designed to improve the customer experience with flexibility and customization features. Ormco has partnered with industry leading intra oral scanner companies as part of its commitment to making imaging integrations seamless. We believe that Spark will provide growth opportunities for our orthodontic business over the next several years.
Equipment & Consumables
Our Equipment & Consumables segment develops, manufactures and markets dental equipment and supplies used in dental offices, including digital imaging systems and sensors, software and other visualization/magnification systems; endodontic systems and related consumables; restorative materials, rotary burs, impression materials, bonding agents and cements; and infection prevention products. Products in this segment are sold primarily through dental distributors, with 86% of segment sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 made through our channel partners. Sales from consumables, services and spare parts comprised approximately 64% of segment sales in 2021.
Imaging
On December 31, 2021, we closed the Divestiture. The retained KaVo business, which is focused on dental imaging equipment, is used in dental offices, clinics and hospitals. In connection with the Divestiture, we will rebrand our KaVo dental imaging products and KaVo dental imaging business. The dental imaging business was primarily established through the acquisition of Gendex in 2004 and PaloDExTM Group Oy in 2009, but also includes products from numerous other acquisitions. Our equipment products are marketed under a variety of brands, including Dexis, Gendex, and i-CAT.
The table below provides a summary description of key products and brands offered by our Imaging business: 
KaVo Imaging was the pioneer in 2D/panoramic and 3D imaging and has one of the largest installed bases of dental imaging devices in the industry with over 150,000 imaging devices currently utilized in dental practices. KaVo Imaging holds a leading position in 3D imaging through the i-CAT and KaVo brands. The i-CAT FLX V17 is the business’ latest 3D CBCT offering and features a wide range of field of views, enabling a clinician to capture high quality images of the full oral-facial complex at high resolution with low radiation. This helps clinicians to more effectively treat orthodontics, complex oral surgery, implantology and airway cases. Beginning in 2017, KaVo Imaging launched the OP3DTM family, a scalable modular imaging system, providing clinicians with the flexibility to upgrade to the latest 3D imaging technology as they expand their capabilities and grow their practices. Our Dexis brand is an industry leader in intraoral X-Ray digital sensors, which provide two-dimensional images of the mouth. The Dexis TitaniumTM is our flagship sensor and captures high quality images with low radiation and has advanced durable materials that make it highly reliable.
The ‘DTX Studio Clinic’ software package is offered on many of our imaging products, allowing dental professionals to store and access a broad variety of clinical patient images (e.g., 2D/3D/IOS/pictures) in one place. In combination with the ‘DTX Studio Implant’ and ‘DTX Studio Lab’ software packages, clinicians can use one software ecosystem from image acquisition and diagnosis to treatment planning, implant surgery and restoration planning and placement, as well as collaborate with treatment partners such as other dentists or laboratories on one digital platform. We believe this will enable significant clinical workflow efficiencies and more predictable clinical outcomes.
Consumables
Our Consumables business markets a broad offering of general dental consumables that are used in dental offices, clinics and hospitals. The business was primarily established through the acquisition of Sybron Dental Specialties in 2006, as well as numerous other acquisitions. Our products are marketed under a variety of brands, including KerrTM, MetrexTM, Total Care, PentronTM, OptibondTM, HarmonizeTM, SonicfillTM, Sybron EndoTM and CaviWipesTM.
The table below provides a summary description of key products and brands offered by our Consumables business:
Kerr’s products have strong brand and product recognition across most consumables categories, including restorative, endodontics, and infection control. Kerr offers several products designed to repair and restore fractured or otherwise damaged teeth. The SonicFill composite bulk fill system replaces conventional time-consuming, multi-stage layering techniques with a single fill system that eliminates a liner or final capping layer. Kerr also offers cements and bonding agents, including the leading OptiBondTM line of products. Kerr Endodontics offers a variety of products used in the endodontic workflow which help clinicians to locate, shape, clean and fill root canals. Kerr also produces curing lights and other consumables including impression materials, burs, amalgams and waxes under several brands. During 2020, Kerr launched SimpliShadeTM, a universal composite featuring three shades resulting in quicker shade-matching, leading to faster chair times and helps streamline restoration workflows and inventory management. 
Through our Metrex brand, we have a significant position within infection prevention products, which include the CaviWipes and CaviCideTM product lines and are well positioned in both the dental and general medical market segments. We expanded our partnership with our CaviWipes manufacturer to give us better access to a robust supply of CaviWipes, as well as adding capacity of other products to help increase output of our disinfectants in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2020, Caviwipes 2.0 was launched, the next generation in surface disinfectant wipes that qualifies for the EPA’s Emerging Viral Pathogen claim. CaviWipes 2.0 has a shorter contact time than the original CaviWipe and is optimized to handle daily infection prevention needs and future public health crises.
International Operations
We are a global dental company. Our products and services are available worldwide, and our principal markets outside the U.S. are in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. In 2021, we generated 53% of our sales in North America, 20% of our sales in Western Europe, 22% of our sales in emerging markets and 5% of our sales in other developed markets.
We also have operations around the world, and this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce, provides greater stability to our operations, allows us to drive economies of scale, provides sales streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for products. In addition, we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to continue developing products and sales models that successfully target emerging markets.
The manner in which our products and services are sold outside the U.S. differs by business and by region. Most of our sales in non-U.S. markets are made by our subsidiaries located outside the U.S., though we also sell directly from the U.S. into non-U.S. markets through various representatives and distributors and, in some cases, directly. In countries with low sales volumes, we generally sell through representatives and distributors.
Information about the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our business is set forth in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For a discussion of risks related to our non-U.S. operations and foreign currency exchange, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors—General Risks.”
Sales and Distribution
Typical customers and end-users of our products include general dentists, dental specialists, dental hygienists, dental laboratories and other oral health professionals, including DSOs, as well as educational, medical and governmental entities and third-party distributors. These customers choose dental products based on the factors described under the section entitled “Business—Competition.”
In 2021, we distributed approximately 43% of our products through third-party distributors. Certain highly technical products, such as dental implant systems, orthodontic appliances, dental laboratory equipment and consumables, and endodontic instruments and materials are typically sold directly to dental professionals and dental laboratories.
One customer, Henry Schein, Inc. (“Henry Schein”), accounted for approximately 12% of our sales in 2021, 11% of our sales for 2020 and 12% of our sales in 2019. Other than Henry Schein, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of combined sales in 2021, 2020 or 2019. 
While a sizable portion of our sales are derived from distributors, most of our marketing and advertising activities are directed towards the end-users of our products (e.g., dentists, hygienists and other oral health professionals, DSOs, laboratories and universities). In addition to our marketing efforts, as noted above, we conduct significant training and education programs globally for these end-users to enhance patient access to high-quality dental care. In these programs, our employees and/or experts in the respective clinical fields demonstrate the proper use of our products. We maintain educational and consulting relationships with key experts who assist us in developing new products, new indicated uses for our products and educational programs for health care providers and consumers. We also maintain educational and consulting relationships with dental associations around the world.
Research and Development
We invest substantially in the development of new products. We conduct research and development activities for the purpose of designing and developing new products and applications that address customer needs and emerging trends, as well as enhancing the functionality, effectiveness, ease of use and reliability of our existing products. Our research and development efforts include internal initiatives as well as collaborations with external parties such as research institutions, dental and medical schools and initiatives that use licensed or acquired technology. We expect to continue investing in research and development at a rate consistent with our past practice, with the goal of maintaining or improving our competitive position, and entering new markets.
We generally conduct research and development activities on a business-by-business basis, primarily in North America, the Middle East, Asia and Europe. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position. For a discussion of the risks related to the need to develop and commercialize new products and product enhancements, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business.” Customer-sponsored research and development was not significant in 2021, 2020 or 2019.
Intellectual Property
We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others. Although in the aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations, we do not consider any single patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or license to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole. Our products and technologies are protected by over 1,600 granted patents. From time to time, we engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights. For a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business.” All capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by, or licensed to, us.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 11,200 persons, of whom approximately 3,000 were employed in the U.S. and approximately 8,200 were employed outside of the U.S. We have collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts in certain countries, particularly in Europe where certain of our employees are represented by unions and/or works councils. For a discussion of risks related to employee relations, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors—General Risks.” 
Our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain a talented employee base. We aspire to help our employees thrive both personally and professionally. As part of these efforts, we strive to embody our core values, offer a competitive compensation and benefits program, foster a community where everyone feels included, respected and engaged, and provide ample professional development opportunities.
Our Board of Directors reviews human capital matters at each quarterly meeting, including periodic updates on succession planning, leadership development, talent acquisition and retention, diversity and inclusion, employee engagement, total rewards, and culture of the Company, among other topics. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our executive and equity compensation programs. At the management level, our Chief Human Resources Officer, who reports directly to our President & CEO, is responsible for the development and execution of our human capital strategy. We evaluate and manage risks relating to our human capital strategy as part of our enterprise risk management program. 
Core Values
We endeavor to embody our values in everything we do and in our various programs and initiatives:
•Customer Centricity
•Innovation
•Respect
•Continuous Improvement
•Leadership
Compensation and Benefits Program
Our compensation programs and practices are designed to attract employees, motivate and reward performance, drive growth and support retention. We offer competitive compensation packages based on market data, which include base salary with annual merit increases and may also include annual cash performance incentives, commissions, overtime opportunities, allowances and, in some countries where these are customary, additional monthly payments. In addition, employees in select senior management roles may receive long-term compensation in the form of equity awards. We regularly review our compensation structure to ensure that we remain competitive, reward top performance, as well as to ensure internal equity. In 2021, we achieved 99% gender pay equity in the U.S. In the U.S., our benefits package includes health (medical, dental & vision) insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, a retirement plan and life and disability coverage. In addition to the robust benefits we offer our employees outside of the U.S., in 2021 we expanded our Employee Assistance Program to all employees globally to support the mental health and well-being of employees and their families. 
Diversity and Inclusion
Diversity, inclusion and equality are at the core of what make our culture and our teams so successful and are embodied by our value of Respect. We know that when our employees show up every day as their authentic selves, there is greater teamwork, more thoughtful debate and more reasons to celebrate. We are committed to a culture where diversity, respect, belonging and authenticity are valued. We drive diversity and inclusion by way of diverse candidate slates for executive and professional level roles and sales roles and we ensure succession plan talent is diverse in representation and receives promotional advocacy. We have a Diversity and Inclusion Council, consisting of leaders within the Company to drive accountability and results for our diversity and inclusion strategic efforts and initiatives. We have four standing Diversity and Inclusion Committees in the areas of talent acquisition and engagement, education and learning, events and celebrations, and global communication. We have two Employee Resource Groups: a women’s and multicultural employee resource group, as well as learning events during each historical heritage month throughout the year to celebrate our workforce. In 2021, we hosted multiple Company-wide D&I events for our employees, customers and dental students. Additionally, we have strategically partnered with the Consortium for early career diverse talent and with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) to further advance our workforce diversity efforts. In 2021, we provided training on Unconscious Bias to our managers and made the course available to all other employees. 
Learning and Development Opportunities
We empower our employees to thrive in their current roles as well as support employees’ aspiration to move into different roles. We have a promote-from-within culture with opportunities across our operating companies. We periodically assess succession planning for certain key positions and review our workforce to identify high potential employees for future growth and development. We support our employees through a multitude of training and development programs, including training on our EBS tools through our Envista Business System University, individual development plans (which encourages our employees to take charge of their learning and growth opportunities and provides access to hundreds of online courses), job rotations, and various management trainings. We also have several programs focused on early career development, including internship programs and our six-year General Management Development Program. This commitment to our employees’ professional development reflects both our Continuous Improvement and Leadership core values. 
Employee Engagement
In 2021, we launched our first employee engagement survey as a standalone public company. We had an 84% participation rate in our inaugural survey and we used the feedback from the survey to better understand whether our employees have the tools, resources, training and development opportunities to succeed. We plan to assess our employee engagement annually and future surveys will help us benchmark our progress over time and compare our results with companies in our sector. Communication is at the core of our engagement efforts and we host monthly CEO Forums for all employees, to keep our employees informed and to provide opportunities for employees globally to ask senior management questions. 
Safe Work Environment
We value the safety of our employees and have leveraged our technological resources to institute work-from-home arrangements for most of our employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. At our manufacturing sites and office locations where employees are required to work on-site, we have implemented significant procedures to help ensure the health and safety of our workforce, that have included daily health and temperature screenings, mandatory face masks, social distancing guidelines, contact tracing, staggered shifts and frequent disinfection processes. Environmental health and safety (“EHS”) significant sites, such as manufacturing, distribution, research and development sites and large offices, are supported through a combination of on-site and remote EHS professionals. Incident reporting and investigation, auditing, and corporate oversight provide for a collaborative and transparent environment to address and minimize potential gaps. 
Additional information about our human capital resources is included in our annual Sustainability Report (located on the Investors subpage of our website www.envistaco.com). Information on our website, including the Sustainability Report, shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. 
Materials
Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials, including metallic-based components, electronic components, chemicals, plastics and other petroleum-based products, and prices of oil and gas also affect our costs for freight and utilities. We purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world. No single supplier is material, although for some components that require particular specifications or qualifications there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components. We utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to our supply chain, including in certain cases the use of safety stock, alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources. During 2021, we had no raw material shortages that had a material effect on our business. For a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business.”
Competition
We believe we are a leader in many of our served markets. Although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets, our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment, since none of our competitors offer all of the same product and service lines and serve all of the same markets as we do. Because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors, including well-established regional competitors, competitors who are more specialized than we are in particular markets, as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales, marketing, research and financial capabilities. We face increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of competitors based in low-cost manufacturing locations, and increasing consolidation in particular markets. Key competitive factors vary among our businesses and product and service lines, but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each segment and typically also include price, quality, performance, delivery speed, applications expertise, distribution channel access, service and support, technology and innovation, breadth of product, service and software offerings and brand name recognition. For a discussion of risks related to competition, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry.”
Seasonal Nature of Business
Based on historical experience, we generally have more sales in the second half of the calendar year than in the first half of the calendar year, with the first quarter typically having the lowest sales of the year. Based on historical customer buying patterns, we generally have more sales in the fourth quarter than in any other quarter of the year, driven in particular by capital spending in our Equipment & Consumables segment. As a result of this seasonality in sales, profitability in our Equipment & Consumables segment also tends to be higher in the second half of the year. There are no assurances that these historical trends will continue in the future.
Regulatory Matters
We face extensive government regulation both within and outside the U.S. relating to the development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of our products, software and services. The following sections describe certain significant regulations that we are subject to. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. For a description of risks related to the regulations that our businesses are subject to, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Laws and Regulations.”
Medical Device Regulations
Most of our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to restrictions under domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”). The FDCA requires these products, when sold in the U.S., to be safe and effective for their intended uses and to comply with the regulations administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). The FDA regulates the design, development, research, preclinical and clinical testing, introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution, import and export and record keeping for such products. Certain medical device products are also regulated by comparable agencies in non-U.S. countries in which they are produced or sold.
Unless an exemption applies, the FDA requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a Section 510(k) premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval (“PMA”) before introducing it into the U.S. market. The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness.
Our products are either classified as Class I or Class II devices in the U.S. Most of our Class II and certain of our Class I devices are marketed pursuant to 510(k) pre-marketing clearances. The FDA also enforces additional regulations regarding the safety of X-ray emitting devices that we currently market. The process of obtaining a Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and clinical data, which in some cases can be extensive, to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the FDA to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre-1976 device. A predecessor device is referred to as “predicate device.” As a result, FDA clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time.
Medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and payment of an FDA user fee. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.
Any devices we manufacture and distribute are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. These include product listing and establishment registration requirements, which help facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory actions. As a medical device manufacturer, all of our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA. We are required to adhere to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) requirements, as set forth in the Quality Systems Regulation (“QSR”), which require, manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process.
We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting, or MDR, requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.
Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.
In the European Union, our products are subject to the medical device laws of the various member states, which are currently based on a Directive of the European Commission. However, the EU has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (the “EU MDR”) which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers of currently approved medical devices had until May 2021 to meet the requirements of the EU MDR. Complying with the EU MDR required modifications to our quality management systems, additional resources in certain functions, and required and will continue to require updates to technical files, among other changes. Our Nobel business has obtained the EU MDR Quality Management System certification and is one of the first in the dental industry to do so. This is an important milestone for Nobel, and we believe that we are on track in our efforts to achieve EU MDR certification for our full portfolio of products. 
Other Healthcare Laws
In addition to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws, we are also subject to various health care related laws regulating fraud and abuse, research and development, pricing and sales and marketing practices and the privacy and security of health information, including the U.S. federal regulations described below. Many states, foreign countries and supranational bodies have also adopted laws and regulations similar to, and in some cases more stringent than, the U.S. federal regulations discussed above and below.
◦The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration in any form (including any kickback, bribe, or certain rebate), directly or indirectly, to induce or reward the referral of business payable under a government healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid, or in return for the purchase, lease, order, arranging for, or recommendation of items or services covered under a government health care program. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
◦The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) prohibits knowingly and willfully (1) executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors, or (2) falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. Similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
◦The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program, knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly makes a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.
◦The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services.
◦The Open Payments Act requires manufacturers of medical devices covered under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, subject to specific exceptions, to record payments and other transfers of value to a broad range of healthcare providers (including dentists) and teaching hospitals and to report this data as well as ownership and investments interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members to the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals.
Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers. Analogous U.S. state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, also may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including private insurers. Further, there are state laws that require medical device manufacturers to comply with the voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; state and local laws requiring the registration of sales representatives; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
For a discussion of risks related to regulation by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries, and the other regulatory regimes referenced above, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Laws and Regulations.”
Healthcare Reform
In the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. For example, in the U.S., in March 2010, the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”) was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affected the healthcare industry. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future.
Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for medical products. Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Dental procedures and products are often paid for out-of-pocket. For products where third-party coverage and reimbursement is available, sales will depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services and, in international markets, many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. Price ceilings, decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce dentist usage and patient demand for the product.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
As a global manufacturer of medical devices, having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business, we are subject to U.S. (federal and state) and international data privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal and/or sensitive information. 
For example, in the U.S., HIPAA privacy, security, and breach notification rules require certain of our operations to maintain controls to protect the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of patient health information. In addition, individual states regulate data breach notification requirements as well as more general privacy and security requirements. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA, for example as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices, or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. 
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act was enacted as an update to HIPAA and makes business associates of covered entities directly liable for compliance with certain HIPAA requirements, strengthens the limitations on the use and disclosure of protected health information without individual authorizations, and contemplates enforcement of noncompliance with HIPAA due to willful neglect. These changes have stimulated increased enforcement activity and enhanced the potential that health care providers will be subject to financial penalties for violations of HIPAA. In addition, the Secretary of HHS is required to perform periodic audits to ensure covered entities (and their business associates, as that term is defined under HIPAA) comply with the applicable HIPAA requirements, increasing the likelihood that a HIPAA violation will result in an enforcement action.
In addition to the federal HIPAA regulations, most states also have laws that protect the confidentiality of health information and other personal information, and these laws may be broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to protected health information and other personal information than HIPAA. Certain of these laws grant individuals various rights with respect to personal information, and we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with these laws. Further, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have adopted data breach notification laws that impose, in varying degrees, an obligation to notify affected persons and/or state regulators in the event of a data breach or compromise, including when their personal information has or may have been accessed by an unauthorized person. 
Some state breach notification laws may also impose physical and electronic security requirements regarding the safeguarding of personal information, such as social security numbers and bank and credit card account numbers. Violation of state privacy, security, and breach notification laws can trigger significant monetary penalties or significant legal liability. In addition, certain states’ privacy, security, and data breach laws, including, for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended, effective January 1, 2023 as the California Privacy Rights Act, the “CPRA”) include private rights of action that may expose us to private litigation regarding our privacy and security practices and significant damages awards or settlements in civil litigation. The CPRA will become effective in January 2023. Comprehensive state privacy laws will also take effect in Colorado and Virginia in 2023. Complying with these and other existing, emerging and changing privacy requirements could cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require it to change its business practices and policies. 
We are also subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the primary data protection law in the European Union and European Economic Area (collectively, the EU), as well as associated EU member state data protection laws and the UK GDPR in the United Kingdom. These laws impose significant requirements for covered businesses (controllers and processors) of personal data, including, for example, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, more robust disclosures to individuals, a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention and secondary uses of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised (i.e., deidentified) data, restrictions on data transfers outside of the EU, and additional obligations when we contract third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR allows EU member states certain flexibility to make additional laws and regulations concerning the same issues, including, for example, further limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR may result in fines of up to €20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Other administrative penalties may be imposed under the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states. 
Other countries throughout the world have or are in the process of passing laws that contain similar requirements to the GDPR. Data localization laws have also been passed or are under consideration in several countries (such as China and Russia), which require personal information relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions.
