All of our gaming operations are located at our entertainment complex in Dover, the capital of the State of Delaware.
 
On July 22, 2018, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Twin River Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (Twin River) pursuant to which, at closing, we will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Twin River.  The merger contemplates that our stockholders will exchange their stock for Twin River common shares representing 7.225% of the equity in the combined company at closing.  Common Stock and Class A Common Stock of Dover Downs will be treated equally in the merger.  The transaction is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization (except for cash paid in lieu of fractional shares). The merger agreement requires the approval of our stockholders and a special meeting of our stockholders is scheduled for March 26, 2019.   Closing under the merger agreement is tentatively scheduled to be on or about March 28, 2019, subject to the approval of our stockholders and other customary closing conditions.
 
On May 14, 2018, a U.S. Supreme Court decision overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act.  As a result, on June 5, 2018 our Race & Sports Book operation began offering a full range of betting on professional and college sports, including single game wagering on a wide variety of sports, including football, baseball, basketball, boxing, mixed martial arts, hockey and soccer.
 
Dover Downs Gaming & Entertainment, Inc. is a public holding company that has two wholly owned subsidiaries: Dover Downs, Inc. and Dover Downs Gaming Management Corp. Dover Downs, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 and began motorsports and harness racing operations in 1969.  In June of 1994, legislation authorizing video lottery operations in the State of Delaware (the State) was adopted.  Our casino operations began on December 29, 1995.  As a result of several restructurings, Dover Downs, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dover Motorsports, Inc. (formerly known as Dover Downs Entertainment, Inc.) (DVD), and became the operating entity for all of DVDs gaming operations.
 
Dover Downs Gaming & Entertainment, Inc. was incorporated in the State in December of 2001 as a wholly owned subsidiary of DVD.  Effective March 31, 2002, DVD completed a tax-free spin-off of its gaming operations by contributing 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Dover Downs, Inc. to Dover Downs Gaming & Entertainment, Inc., and subsequently distributing 100% of our issued and outstanding common stock to DVD stockholders.  Immediately following the spin-off, Dover Downs Gaming & Entertainment, Inc. became an independent publicly traded company.

Dover Downs, Inc. is authorized to conduct video lottery, sports wagering, table game and internet gaming operations as one of three Licensed Agents under the Delaware State Lottery Code.  Licensing, administration and control of gaming operations in Delaware is under the Delaware State Lottery Office and Delawares Department of Safety and Homeland Security, Division of Gaming Enforcement.
 
Our license from the Delaware Harness Racing Commission (the Commission) to hold harness race meetings on our premises and to offer pari-mutuel wagering on live and simulcast horse races must be renewed on an annual basis.  In order to maintain our gaming license, we are required to maintain our harness horse racing license.  We have received an annual license from the Commission for the past 50 consecutive years and management believes that our relationship with the Commission remains good.
 
Due to the nature of our business activities, we are subject to various federal, state and local regulations.  As part of our license arrangements, we are subject to various taxes and fees which are subject to change by the Delaware legislature.
 
In recent years, the mid-Atlantic region has experienced a significant expansion in gaming venues and gaming offerings.  This has had a significant adverse effect on our visitation numbers, our revenues and our profitability.  Management has estimated that approximately 28% of our gaming win comes from Maryland patrons and approximately 58% of our Capital Club® member gaming win comes from out of state patrons.
 
In June 2018, after several years of effort, legislation providing relief to the States gaming industry was enacted.  Senate Substitute No. 1 to Senate Bill 144, which passed with broad support in both the House and Senate, was signed by the Governor on June 30, 2018.  Effective July 1, 2018, the Bill revised the States share of gross table game revenues from 29.4% to 15.5%; eliminated the table game license fee for each video lottery agent, provided that the agent increase certain expenditures on marketing, wages and benefits; reduced the States share of gross slot machine revenues by 1%, with a further 2% reduction possible, beginning July 1, 2019, for each video lottery agent, provided that the agent make certain qualified capital expenditures; and increased purses to horsemen by 0.6% (over two years).  The Bill also removed the prohibition against video lottery agents operating on Christmas or Easter.
 
Dover Downs Casino
 
Our casino opened in December 1995 with approximately 500 slot machines.  Due to its popularity, the casino has expanded six times since its opening.  The casino complex features 165,000 square-feet of space and houses approximately 2,200 slot machines,  40 table games including blackjack, craps and roulette, and 12 poker tables at December 31, 2018.  We are open for business 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  Historically, our facilities have been open every day of the year except Christmas and Easter.  In 2018, we were open on Christmas and we estimate that the facility was visited by approximately 1.8 million patrons during the year.  Beginning in 2019, our facility will be open every day of the year.
 
Our slot machines range from our popular penny machines to $100 machines in the Premium Slots area and include some of the most popular games found in the countrys major gaming jurisdictions.
 
Our Race & Sports Book operation features a full range of betting on professional and college sports, including single game wagering on a wide variety of sports, including football, baseball, basketball, boxing, mixed martial arts, hockey and soccer, and pari-mutuel wagering on live and simulcast horse races.
 
Dover Downs, Inc. is authorized to conduct video lottery, sports wagering, table game and internet gaming operations as one of three Licensed Agents under the Delaware State Lottery Code.  Licensing, administration and control of gaming operations in Delaware is under the Delaware State Lottery Office and Delawares Department of Safety and Homeland Security, Division of Gaming Enforcement.  We are required by law to set the payout on our slot machines to customers between 87% and 95%.
 
We use sophisticated database marketing to enable us to develop long-term relationships with our patrons and to target promotions to specific customer segments.  Our Capital Club®, a slots players club and tracking system, allows us to identify customers and to reward their level of play through various marketing programs.  Membership
 
3




in this club currently stands at approximately 120,000 active patrons in one of three tiers  Capital Gold®, Capital Platinum® or Platinum Elite®.
 
We have implemented extensive procedures for financial and accounting controls, safekeeping and accounting of monies, and security provisions.  Security over the gaming operations involves the integration of surveillance cameras, observation and oversight by employees, security and gaming staff, and various security features built into our equipment.  The above, when combined with proper internal control procedures and daily monitoring by the Delaware State Lottery Office and Delawares Department of Safety and Homeland Security, Division of Gaming Enforcement, are intended to maintain the security, integrity and accountability of our gaming operations.
 
Dover Downs Hotel
 
Our luxury hotel facility, the Dover Downs Hotel and Conference Center, is the largest hotel in the State of Delaware and connects to our casino.  The facility includes 500 rooms, including eleven luxury spa suites, a multi-purpose ballroom/concert hall, a fine dining restaurant, swimming pool and a luxurious 6,000 square-foot full-service spa.  Our facility offers 41,500 square feet of multi-use event space, the most of any hotel in Delaware.  By offering a wide range of entertainment options to our patrons, including concerts featuring prominent entertainers, live boxing, gourmet dining, spa facilities, trade shows and conferences, we believe we are able to attract new patrons and lengthen the stay of current patrons and encourage visits from patrons who may have a more convenient gaming option.  In 2018, hotel occupancy averaged 83%.
Dover Downs Raceway
 
Dover Downs Raceway has presented pari-mutuel harness racing events for 50 consecutive years.  Live harness races are conducted at Dover Downs Raceway from November until April and are simulcast to more than 300 tracks and other off-track betting locations across North America on each of our 81 scheduled live race dates.  During our harness racing season, we have historically used the 5/8-mile harness racing track that is located on DVDs property and is on the inside of its one-mile motorsports superspeedway.  In order to continue this historic use, DVD granted a perpetual easement to the harness track to us at the time of the spin-off.  This perpetual easement allows us to have exclusive use of the harness track during the period beginning November 1 of each year and ending April 30 of the following year, together with set up and tear down rights for the two weeks before and after such period.  The easement requires that we maintain the harness track but does not require the payment of any rent.  Additional amenities include the Winners Circle® Restaurant overlooking the horse racing track.
 
Within our Race & Sports Book operation is the simulcast parlor where our patrons can wager on harness and thoroughbred races received by satellite into our facility year round from numerous tracks across North America.  Large flat screen monitors throughout the area provide views of all races simultaneously and the betting windows are connected to a central computer allowing bets to be received on all races from all tracks.
 
Harness racing in the State of Delaware is governed by the Delaware Harness Racing Commission.  We hold a license from the Harness Racing Commission authorizing us to hold harness race meetings on our premises and to offer pari-mutuel wagering on live and simulcast horse races.
 
In harness racing, competing horses are harnessed to a two-wheeled sulky, which carries the driver.  Pari-mutuel wagering is pooled betting by which the wagering public, not the track, determines the odds and the payoff.  The track retains a commission, which is a percentage of the total amount wagered, or the handle.  Simulcasting is the transmission of live horse racing by television, cable or satellite signal from a race track to another facility with pari-mutuel wagering being conducted at the sending track and the receiving facility and a portion of the handle being shared by the sending track and receiving facility.
 
The legislation authorizing our gaming operations under the Delaware Lottery was initially adopted in June 1994, and is referred to as the Horse Racing Redevelopment Act.  The Delaware General Assemblys stated purpose in approving the legislation was to (i) provide non-state supported assistance in the form of increased economic activity and vitality for Delawares harness and thoroughbred horse racing industries, which activity and vitality will enable the industry to improve its facilities and breeding stock, and cause increased employment; and (ii) restrict the location of gaming operations to locations where wagering is already permitted and controls exist.  A

portion of the proceeds from our gaming operations is allocated to increase the purses for harness horse races held at Dover Downs Raceway and is intended to provide increased vitality for Delawares horse racing industry.
 
We have an agreement with the Delaware Standardbred Owners Association, Inc. (DSOA) effective October 4, 2017 and continuing through August 31, 2020.  DSOAs membership consists of owners, trainers and drivers of harness horses participating in harness race meetings at our facilities and elsewhere in the United States and Canada.  The DSOA has been organized and exists for the purpose of promoting the sport of harness racing; improving the lot of owners, drivers and trainers of harness racing horses participating in race meetings; establishing health, welfare and insurance programs for owners, drivers and trainers of harness racing horses; negotiating with harness racing tracks on behalf of owners, trainers, drivers and grooms of harness racing horses; and generally rendering assistance to them whenever and wherever possible.  Under the DSOA agreement, we are required to distribute as purses for races conducted at our facilities a percentage of our retained share of pari-mutuel revenues.
 
We enjoy a good relationship with representatives of DSOA and anticipate that this relationship will continue.  We believe that the DSOA agreement is typical of similar agreements in the industry.
 
Licensing and Regulation by Gaming and Other Authorities
 
General
 
We are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulations related to our operations, particularly our video lottery, sports wagering, table game and internet gaming operations, live harness racing and pari-mutuel wagering.  These operations are contingent upon continued government approval of such operations as forms of legalized gaming and could be subjected at any time to additional or more restrictive regulations.  The following is a brief outline of some of the more significant regulations affecting our gaming operations and not intended as a recitation of all regulations applicable to our business.
 
Delaware law regulates the percentage of commission we are entitled to receive from our gaming activities, which comprises a significant portion of our overall revenues.  Our licenses to conduct video lottery, sports wagering and table game operations, harness horse races and pari-mutuel wagering could be modified or repealed at any time and we could be required to terminate our gaming operations.
 
Video Lottery, Sports Wagering, Table Game and Internet Gaming Operations
 
General.  Video lottery, sports wagering, table game and internet gaming operations are by statute operated and administered by the Director of the Delaware State Lottery Office (the Lottery Director) and Delawares Department of Safety and Homeland Security, Division of Gaming Enforcement.  We are a Licensed Agent authorized to conduct these activities under the Delaware State Lottery Code.
 
The Lottery Director has discretion to adopt such rules and regulations as the Lottery Director deems necessary or desirable for the efficient and economical operation and administration of the lottery, including (i) type and number of games permitted, (ii) pricing of games, (iii) numbers and sizes of prizes, (iv) manner of payment, (v) value of bills, coins or tokens needed to play, (vi) requirements for licensing agents and service providers, (vii) standards for advertising, marketing and promotional materials used by Licensed Agents, (viii) procedures for accounting and reporting, (ix) registration, kind, type, number and location of  machines or equipment on a Licensed Agents premises, (x) security arrangements for the gaming systems, and (xi) reporting and auditing of financial information of Licensed Agents.
 
Licensing Requirements.  We were granted a gaming license on December 13, 1995.  Initially, the license was for video lottery operations but it now extends to our sports wagering, table game and internet gaming operations.  Delaware gaming licenses do not have an expiration date.
 
There are continuing licensure requirements for all officers, directors, key employees and persons who own directly or indirectly 10% or more of a Licensed Agent, which licensure requirements shall include the satisfaction of such security, fitness and background standards as the Lottery Director may deem necessary relating to competence, honesty and integrity, such that a persons reputation, habits and associations do not pose a threat to the
 
5




public interest of the State or to the reputation of or effective regulation and control of the lottery; it being specifically understood that any person convicted of any felony, a crime involving gambling, or a crime of moral turpitude within 10 years prior to applying for a license or at any time thereafter shall be deemed unfit.
 
There are similar licensure requirements for providers of equipment and certain companies that seek to provide services to a Licensed Agent.
 
Revocation, Suspension or Modification of License.  The Lottery Director may revoke or suspend the license of a Licensed Agent, such as ours, for cause.  Cause is broadly defined and could potentially include falsifying any application for license or report required by the rules and regulations, the failure to report any information required by the rules and regulations, the material violation of any rules and regulations promulgated by the Lottery Director or any conduct by the licensee which undermines the public confidence in the lottery or serves the interest of organized gambling or crime and criminals in any manner.  A license may be revoked for an unintentional violation of any federal, state or local law, rule or regulation provided that the violation is not cured within a reasonable time as determined by the Lottery Director.  A hearing officers decision revoking or suspending the license shall be appealable to the Delaware Superior Court under the provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act.  All existing or new officers, directors, key employees and owners of a Licensed Agent are subject to background investigation.  Failure to satisfy the background investigation may constitute cause for suspension or revocation of the License.
Ownership Changes.  Under Delaware law, a change of ownership of a Licensed Agent will automatically terminate its license 90 days after the change of ownership occurs, unless the Lottery Director determines after application to issue a new license to the new owners.  Change of ownership may occur if any new individual or entity acquires, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the Licensed Agent or if more than 20% of the legal or beneficial interest in the Licensed Agent is transferred, whether by direct or indirect means.  The Lottery Director may require extensive background investigations of any new owner acquiring a 10% or greater interest in a Licensed Agent, including criminal background checks.  Accordingly, we have a restrictive legend on our shares of common stock which require that (a) any holders of common stock found to be disqualified or unsuitable or not possessing the qualifications required by any appropriate gaming authority could be required to dispose of such stock and (b) any holder of common stock intending to acquire 10% or more of our outstanding common stock must first obtain prior written approval from the Delaware State Lottery Office.
Harness Racing Events.  In order to maintain our gaming license with the Delaware Lottery, we are required to maintain our license for harness horse racing with the Harness Racing Commission and must conduct a minimum of 80 live race days each racing season, subject to the availability of racing stock.
Control Over Equipment and Technology.  We do not own or lease the slot machines, betting terminals, or computer systems used by the State in connection with our video lottery gaming and sports betting operations.  The Lottery Director enters into contracts directly with the providers of the slot machines and computer systems and we are not a party to those negotiations.  The State purchases or leases all equipment and the Lottery Director licenses all technology providers and we share in the expense.  Similarly, but at no expense to us, the Lottery Director enters into contracts directly with internet service providers.  Our operations could be disrupted if a licensed technology provider violates its agreement with the State or ceases to be licensed for any reason.  Such an event would be outside of our control and could adversely affect our gaming revenues.
 
Harness Racing and Pari-Mutuel Wagering
 
Licensing Requirements.  Harness racing in the State of Delaware is governed by the Delaware Harness Racing Commission.  We hold a license from the Commission by which we are authorized to hold harness race meetings on our premises and to make, conduct and sell pools by the use of pari-mutuel machines or totalizators.  The license must be renewed on an annual basis.  The Commission may reject an application for a license for any cause which it deems sufficient and the action of the Commission is final.  The Commission may also suspend or revoke a license which it has issued and its action in that respect is final, subject to review, upon questions of law only, by the Superior Court of the County within which the license was granted.  The action of the Commission stands unless and until reversed by the Court.  We have received an annual license from the Commission for the past 49 consecutive years and management believes that our relationship with the Commission remains good.  However, there can be no assurances that we will continue to be licensed by the Commission in the future.
 
6




Under the law, the Commission has broad powers of supervision and regulation.  The Commission may prescribe rules, regulations and conditions under which all harness racing and betting pools shall be conducted; may regulate the performance of any service or the sale of any article on the premises of a licensee; may compel the production of books and documents of a licensee and require that books and records be kept in such manner as the Commission may prescribe; may visit, investigate and place accountants or other persons as it deems necessary, at the expense of a licensee, in the office, track or place of business of a licensee; may summon witnesses and administer oaths; and may require the removal of any employee or official employed by a licensee.  All proposed extensions, additions or improvements to the property of a licensee are subject to the approval of the Commission.
 
The Commission is required to inspect a licensees racing plant not less than five days prior to a race meeting and may withdraw the license for the meeting if the racing plant is found to be unsafe for animals or persons or is not rendered safe prior to the opening of the meeting.  A licensee must deposit with the Commission, ten days before a race meeting, a policy of insurance against personal injury liability in an amount to be approved by the Commission.
 
USTA.  Any license granted by the Commission may also be subject to such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed from time to time by the United States Trotting Association (USTA).  The USTA sets various rules relating to the conduct of harness racing.  According to its Articles of Incorporation, the purposes of the USTA shall include the improvement of the breed of trotting and pacing horses, the establishment of rules regulating standards and the registration of such horses thereunder, the advancement and promotion of the interest of harness racing in the United States, the investigation, ascertainment and registration of the pedigrees of such horses, the regulation and government of the conduct of the sport of harness racing, the establishment of rules for the conduct thereof, not inconsistent with the laws of the various states, and the sanctioning of the holding of exhibitions of such horses and meetings for the racing thereof, the issuance of licenses to qualified persons to officiate at harness race meetings and exhibitions, the issuance of licenses to the owners of horses permitting the exhibition and racing of such horses and the qualification thereof, the issuance of licenses to drivers of horses participating in such races or exhibitions, and providing for the enforcement of the rules promulgated by the USTA, and providing for the fixing of penalties, fines, and the suspension or expulsion from membership, or privileges or for any other misconduct detrimental to the sport.
Gaming Taxes and Fees
 
We believe that the prospect of significant additional tax revenue is one of the primary reasons why jurisdictions have legalized gaming.  As a result, gaming operators are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes.  These taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time.  We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our gaming operations and the States share of our gaming win has been increased several times.  In addition, any material increase in taxes or fees, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, may have a material adverse effect on our future financial results.
Compliance with Other Laws
 
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations.  These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising.  Laws and regulations governing the use and development of real estate may delay or complicate any improvements we choose to make and/or increase the costs of any improvements or our costs of operating.
 
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires operators of casinos located in the United States to file information returns for United States citizens, including names and addresses of winners, for all winnings in excess of stipulated amounts.  The IRS also requires operators to withhold taxes on certain winnings.
 
Regulations adopted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department (FinCEN) require us to report currency transactions in excess of stipulated amounts occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the patron by name and social security number.  FinCEN has also established regulations that require us to file suspicious activity reports on all transactions that we know, suspect, or have reason to suspect fall
 
7




into specific categories that are deemed to be suspicious.  We believe our programs meet the requirements of the applicable regulations.
 
Laws and regulations are always subject to change, can be interpreted differently in the future, and new laws and regulations may be enacted which could adversely affect the tax, regulatory, operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and our company.  Furthermore, noncompliance with one or more of these laws and regulation could result in the imposition of substantial penalties against us.
 
Competition
 
The gaming industry in the United States is intensely competitive and features many participants, including riverboat casinos, dockside casinos, land-based casinos and racinos, slot and poker machines, whether or not located in casinos, native American gaming, pari-mutuel wagering on live and simulcast horse racing, off-track betting, state run lotteries, internet gambling and other forms of gambling. Gaming competition is particularly intense in each of these sectors.
 
We compete in local and regional markets with casinos, horse tracks and racinos, off-track betting parlors, state run lotteries, internet gambling and other forms of gaming.  In a broader sense, our gaming operations face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including shopping, collegiate and professional athletic events, television and movies, concerts and travel.  Many of our gaming competitors are in jurisdictions with a closer proximity to large population bases and with a lower tax burden.  As gambling opportunities in the region continue to proliferate, there can be no assurance that we will maintain our state or regional market share or be able to compete effectively with our competitors and this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and overall profitability.
 
The introduction or expansion of gaming in neighboring jurisdictions, particularly Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania or New Jersey, the proliferation of internet gaming or the legalization of additional gaming venues in Delaware, could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.  Delaware is surrounded by jurisdictions which permit slot machines and table games, such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and West Virginia.
 
In recent years, the mid-Atlantic region has experienced a significant expansion in gaming venues and gaming offerings.  This has had a significant adverse effect on our visitation numbers, our revenues and our profitability.  Management has estimated that approximately 28% of our gaming win comes from Maryland patrons and approximately 58% of our Capital Club® member gaming win comes from out of state patrons.
 
All states in our geographic region have state-run lotteries.  State run lotteries are no longer prohibited by federal law from offering lottery products or other gaming opportunities over the internet or through mobile applications if permitted by state law.
 
Several states have passed legislation authorizing internet gaming and other states are pursuing or exploring the legalization of internet gaming in various forms  from fantasy sports to state run lotteries to privately run casino games, including online poker.  States are aggressively seeking new revenue streams through gaming.
 
Competition in horse racing is varied since racetracks in the surrounding area differ in many respects.  Some tracks only offer thoroughbred or harness horse racing; others have both.  Tracks have live racing seasons that may or may not overlap with neighboring tracks.  Depending on the purse structure, tracks that are farther apart may compete with each other more for quality horses than for patrons.
 
Live harness racing also competes with simulcasts of thoroughbred and harness racing.  All racetracks in the region are involved with simulcasting.  In addition, a number of off-track betting parlors compete with track simulcasting activities.  With respect to the simulcasting of our live harness races to tracks and other locations, our simulcast signals are in direct competition with live races at the receiving track and other races being simulcast to the receiving location.
 
8




Within the State of Delaware, we face little direct live competition from the States other two tracks.  Harrington Raceway, a south central Delaware fairgrounds track, conducts harness horse racing periodically between April and October.  Delaware Park, a northern Delaware track, conducts thoroughbred horse racing from May through mid-October.  There is no overlap presently with our live race season from Harrington or Delaware Park.
 
We compete with harness and thoroughbred racing and simulcasting facilities in the neighboring states of Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey.  We also receive simulcast harness and thoroughbred races from approximately 80 race tracks.
 
Competition for our hotel varies and consists of local and regional competition.  With respect to hotel accommodations only, we compete with a variety of nearby hotels in the Dover area; however, none of these offer the luxury accommodations and amenities that we offer.  With respect to trade shows, conferences, concerts and hotel room packages tied to these events or tied to our casino and other gaming offerings, we compete at a regional level with the other gaming operations referred to above and with convention centers and larger hotels in major cities such as Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Baltimore and Wilmington.
 
In addition, our activities compete with other leisure, entertainment and recreational activities.
 
Mission and Strategy
 
We offer a unique gaming and entertainment experience and make available to our patrons a number of different options: slot machine gaming, table game wagering, sports wagering, live harness horse racing, luxury hotel accommodations, fine dining, full service spa, national recording and entertainment acts, night club, retail shopping, trade shows and conferences, and simulcasting of thoroughbred and harness horse races from across North America.  Our mission is simple: to provide all of our customers a premier gaming and entertainment experience with a focus on unparalleled customer service. We foster customer loyalty by following this mission, focus on our most valuable customers, improve the quality of our gaming positions, enhance our gaming products with additional entertainment offerings and create an exciting gaming environment while focusing on areas that we believe will increase our revenue and profitability.
 
We use a sophisticated database marketing program to enable us to develop long-term relationships with our patrons and to target promotions to specific customer segments.  Our Capital Club, a players club and tracking system, allows us to identify customers and to reward their level of play through various marketing programs.  Membership in this club currently stands at approximately 120,000 active patrons.  We attempt to increase attendance at both our casino and hotel through effective promotional use of our database and by making improvements to our facilities and gaming offerings based on what we learn from our Capital Club members.  For example, we continually add the most popular machines, have added live table games and sports betting, as well as multi-player electronic table games and other amenities requested by our customers.  We began offering internet gaming in 2013.
 
Our luxury hotel facility, the Dover Downs Hotel, connects to our casino and is the only casino hotel in the State.  By offering a wide range of entertainment options to our patrons, including concerts featuring prominent entertainers, live boxing, gourmet dining, spa amenities, trade shows and conferences, we believe we are able to attract new patrons and lengthen the stay of current patrons.
 
Seasonality
 
Our quarterly operating results are affected by weather and the general economic conditions in the United States.  Additionally, given our high level of fixed operating costs, fluctuations in our business volume can lead to variations in quarterly operating results.  The results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in any future period.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,388 employees, of which 906 were full-time.  We engage temporary personnel to assist during our live harness racing season.  None of our employees are party to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
Available Information
 
We file annual, quarterly and current reports, information statements and other information with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).  The public may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.  The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.  The SEC also maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.  The address of that site is www.sec.gov.
Internet Address
 
We maintain a website where additional information concerning our business and various upcoming events can be found.  The address of our Internet website is www.doverdowns.com.  We provide a link on our website, under Investor Relations, to our filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K, proxy statement, Section 16 reports, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports.
