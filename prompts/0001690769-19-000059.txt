Item 1. Business
Overview
Alta Mesa Resources, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (“we” or “the Company”), is an independent exploration and production company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the eastern portion of the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma. We operate in two reportable business segments - Upstream and Midstream. Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”) conducts our Upstream activities and owns our proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in an area of the Anadarko Basin commonly referred to as the STACK. We generate upstream revenue principally by the production and sale of oil, gas and NGLs. We also operate in the Midstream segment through Kingfisher Midstream, LLC (“KFM”). KFM has a gas and oil gathering network, a cryogenic gas processing plant with offtake capacity, field compression facilities and a produced water disposal system in the Anadarko Basin that generate revenue primarily through long-term, fee-based contracts. The KFM assets are integral to our Upstream operations, which we conduct in the same region, and they are strategically positioned to provide similar services to other producers in the area.  Our principal offices are at 15021 Katy Freeway, Suite 400, Houston, Texas 77094 and our main phone number is (281) 530-0991.
We were originally incorporated in Delaware in November 2016 as a special purpose acquisition company under the name Silver Run Acquisition Corporation II for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses.
In connection with the closing of the Business Combination discussed below, the Company changed its name from “Silver Run Acquisition Corporation II” to “Alta Mesa Resources, Inc.”
Beginning in the 1990’s, our predecessor operations were focused on vertical wells, waterfloods and analyzing the commercial productivity of the stacked formations on our acreage. Since 2012, our activities have become primarily directed at the horizontal development of an oil and liquids-rich resource play in the STACK. The STACK is a prolific hydrocarbon system with high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, with potential for multiple horizontal target horizons, extensive production history and high drilling success rates. We generally maintain operational control of the majority of our properties, either through directly operating them or through operating arrangements with other interest owners. 
As of December 31, 2018, we have assembled a highly contiguous position of 140,400 net acres in the up-dip, naturally-fractured oil portion of the STACK, primarily in eastern Kingfisher and southeastern Major Counties in Oklahoma. Our drilling locations primarily target the Osage, Meramec and Oswego formations. After the Business Combination, we conducted

development activities using a spacing array of 6 to 10 wells per section and running up to 9 rigs at the peak activity level. In late 2018, our production across the acreage evidenced that the well spacing was not delivering the well level production that we expected. During January 2019, we suspended our development program to allow our new management team to conduct a full operational and economic review. We restarted our development program in March 2019 with a less dense spacing pattern of up to five wells per section. In addition, we have worked to improve our economic returns by reducing well costs, general and administrative expense and other operating expense. We have operated 2 rigs since restarting the program, however following the redetermination of the borrowing base of the Alta Mesa RBL in August, we have decided to operate 1 rig starting in September. We will continue to evaluate how much, if any, development is appropriate going forward.
Organizational Structure 
The following diagram illustrates our ownership structure as of December 31, 2018.
Business Combination
As described further in Item 8 of this Annual Report, certain transactions were consummated on February 9, 2018, that resulted in our acquisition of interests in Alta Mesa, Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC (“Alta Mesa GP”) and KFM through a newly formed subsidiary, SRII Opco, LP (“SRII Opco”). These transactions are referred to as the “Business Combination.” Prior to the closing of the Business Combination, Alta Mesa was controlled by High Mesa, Inc. (“HMI”).
During the fourth quarter of 2017, Alta Mesa sold certain of its non-STACK oil and gas assets and liabilities. Immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination, Alta Mesa distributed its remaining non-STACK oil and gas assets and liabilities to High Mesa Holdings, LP (the “AM Contributor”), such that Alta Mesa’s only remaining oil and gas assets and liabilities were located in the STACK. As described elsewhere, the AM Contributor owes us a substantial sum for amounts arising before and after the Business Combination, and it has indemnified us for liabilities arising from non-STACK oil and gas assets. We believe there is substantial doubt about its ability to make payment and honor its indemnification. Information related to Alta Mesa’s non-STACK oil and gas assets and liabilities that were sold or distributed is disclosed as discontinued operations in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Pursuant to the Business Combination, we recorded the acquired assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values and pushed those values down to the financial records of our respective subsidiaries. This resulted in our financial presentation being

separated into two distinct periods - the period before the Business Combination on February 9, 2018 (“Predecessor”) and the period after the Business Combination (“Successor”). 
Going Concern
Our present level of indebtedness and the current commodity price environment present challenges to our ability to comply with the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness. As a result of the decrease in our forecasted production levels compared to the forecasts at the time of the Business Combination and pressures created by lower commodity prices, in the absence of one or more deleveraging transactions, we do not anticipate maintaining compliance with the consolidated total leverage ratio covenant in the Alta Mesa RBL as early as the measurement date of September 30, 2019. In addition, we have been substantially fully utilized under the Alta Mesa RBL since April 2019 and have no meaningful remaining capital availability. Our lenders exercised their right to conduct an optional redetermination ahead of the regularly scheduled redetermination in October 2019 and have established a new borrowing base of $200.0 million, effective August 13, 2019. As provided under the Alta Mesa RBL, we have elected to repay the excess utilization in 5 equal monthly installments of $32.5 million, the first of which will be due in September 2019. If we are unable to make these deficiency payments, we would be in default under the Alta Mesa RBL. Our Board and its financial advisors are evaluating the available financial alternatives, including seeking amendments or waivers to the covenants or other provisions of our indebtedness to address our capital structure including raising new capital from the private or public markets or taking other actions either in court or out of court. If we are unable to reach an agreement with our lenders or find acceptable alternative financing, it may lead to an event of default under our debt agreements. If following an event of default, the Alta Mesa RBL lenders were to accelerate repayment, it may result in an event of default and an acceleration of the 2024 Notes. We have concluded that these circumstances create substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. 
If an agreement is reached with our creditors and we pursue a restructuring, it may be necessary for us, or our subsidiaries, to file a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in order to implement the agreement through the confirmation and consummation of a plan of reorganization approved by the bankruptcy court. We may also conclude it is necessary to initiate Chapter 11 proceedings to implement a restructuring of our obligations even if we are otherwise unable to reach an agreement with our creditors. If a plan of reorganization is implemented in a bankruptcy proceeding, it is possible that holders of claims and interests with respect to, or rights to acquire, our equity securities would be entitled to little or no recovery, and those claims and interests may be canceled for little or no consideration. If that were to occur, we anticipate that all or substantially all of the value of all investments in our equity securities would be lost and that our equity holders would lose all or substantially all of their investment. It is also possible that our stakeholders, including our secured and unsecured creditors, will receive substantially less than the amount of their claims. For a more detailed discussion, please read the Risk Factors in Item 1A.
Sale of Produced Water Assets
In November 2018, Alta Mesa sold substantially all of its produced water assets, consisting of produced water gathering pipelines, facilities, disposal wells, surface leases and easements, to a subsidiary of KFM for approximately $99 million, including approximately $90 million in cash at closing and $9 million of purchase price adjustments, which, in total, approximated the net book value of the produced water assets. Because Alta Mesa and KFM are each owned by SRII Opco, the transaction was accounted for as a transfer of assets among entities under common control and the purchase was recorded at book value by KFM. In conjunction with the sale, Alta Mesa entered into a new 15-year produced water agreement with KFM. 
Principal Products, Markets and Customers
Our Upstream segment sells our production to customers generally at prevailing spot prices in effect at the time of the sale. Our Midstream segment derives its revenue from fees assessed for gathering and processing natural gas, gathering and transporting oil, the sale of processed residue gas and NGLs and produced water gathering and disposal services. Natural gas is processed on behalf of the producer and the resulting gas, condensate and NGLs are sold at market prices. We remit to the producer an agreed-upon price from the resulting sales, which is treated as product expense. Collateral or other security is generally not required with regard to our trade receivables.

Index to Financial Statements

Much of our oil and gas production in 2018, including certain processed gas and NGLs, was sold through a marketing agreement with ARM Energy Management, LLC (“ARM”), who marketed and sold our oil and gas production and processed products under short-term contracts, generally with month-to-month pricing based on published indices, adjusted for transportation, location and quality. ARM generally remitted monthly collections of these sales to us, net of its fee. For the Successor Period, ARM marketed $336.2 million, or 71% of our total operating revenue for the period. 
Effective as of June 1, 2019, we have terminated our oil and NGL marketing agreement with ARM and will market such products internally. We have extended the term of our gas marketing agreement with ARM through November 30, 2019. With respect to gas sales, ARM continues to collect payments from purchasers, deducts their marketing fee and remits the balance to us.
We also sell our NGL production under various contracts with processors in the vicinity of the production at spot market rates, after processing costs. Other than our marketing agreement with ARM, no other customers accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated sales for the Successor Period. We do not believe the loss of any specific customer, or of our marketing agent ARM, would have a material adverse effect on us because alternative purchasers are available.
The oil and gas production from our operated STACK acreage, not otherwise previously dedicated, is dedicated to KFM for midstream services.

Seasonality
Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, oil and gas. During the winter, natural gas demand for heating by residential and commercial consumers generally increases whereas high summer temperatures can result in an increase in demand from the power sector. Natural gas in storage typically increases from April through October. Crude oil markets tend to be stronger in the fourth quarter when demand for heating oil is impacted by colder weather and inventory build. Hurricanes and other severe weather (particularly along the Gulf Coast) can also impact supplies by causing disruptions in the level of oil and gas production. Due to these fluctuations, results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that may be realized on an annual basis.
Competition
We compete with other companies in all areas of our operations, including the acquisition of producing properties and undeveloped acreage. Our competitors include major integrated oil and gas companies and independent oil and gas companies. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies with substantially greater resources and better credit than us and have been engaged in the oil and gas business for a longer period of time than we have. This may allow our competitors to have an advantage over us with respect to:

• | acquisitions of oil and gas properties, exploratory prospects and mineral leases;


• | evaluations of properties;


• | utilization of midstream assets; and

6

Index to Financial Statements


• | absorption of price changes and the costs and implementation of evolving federal, state and local laws and regulations.

We are also affected by competition for drilling rigs and other equipment, including that used in our completion process. In the past, the oil and gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe, materials (including drilling and completion fluids) and personnel. These shortages can delay our development, exploitation and exploration activities. We are unable to predict when, or if, such future shortages will occur or their impact on our operations.
With decreased activity in the STACK since 2018, we have seen opportunities to renegotiate our service costs. We believe that we can continue to drive service costs down or maintain the savings that we have captured during 2019, unless there is a spike in commodity prices and industry activity or heightened concerns about our creditworthiness. 
Regulatory Environment
Our Upstream and Midstream operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational safety and health, the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection. Numerous governmental agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions. Among other things, these laws and regulations may:

• | require various permits before drilling and other regulated activities commence;


• | require installation of pollution control equipment and place other conditions on our operations;


• | place restrictions on the use of materials for our operations and upon the disposal of by-products from our operations;


• | restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment or used for our operations;


• | limit our operations on lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas;


• | require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, including site restoration, pit closure and plugging of abandoned wells; and


• | impose specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection.

These laws, rules and regulations often impose difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in remedial or corrective action obligations. 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes. Pursuant to rules issued by the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. As part of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes that may be deemed as hazardous wastes by regulatory authorities. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with our operations, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that regulations could change and cause wastes now classified as non-hazardous to be classified as hazardous wastes. 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability on classes of persons considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances and other classes of materials. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for damages without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct. These classes of persons, dubbed potentially-responsible-parties (“PRPs”) include the current and past owners or operators of a site where the hazardous substance release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to take actions in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the PRPs the costs of such action. Many states have adopted comparable statutes.

Federal Water Pollution Control Act
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state and federal waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements imposed under the CWA require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities.
Safe Drinking Water Act
Our underground injection operations are regulated pursuant to the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program established under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and analogous state and local laws and regulations. The UIC program includes administrative requirements for produced water disposal and prohibits migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. State regulations require permits to operate underground injection wells. Although we monitor the injection process of our wells, any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of our UIC permit, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and imposition of liability by third-parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property and personal injuries. A change in UIC disposal well regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new disposal wells in the future may affect our ability to dispose of produced waters and other substances, which could affect our business.
Furthermore, in response to recent seismic events near produced water disposal wells, federal and some state agencies are investigating whether such wells have contributed to increased seismic activity, and some states have restricted, suspended or shut down the use of such disposal wells. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Oklahoma issued new rules for injection wells in 2014 that imposed certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults and also, from time to time, has developed and implemented plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations.
Clean Air Act
Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws and regulations that restrict the emission of air pollutants. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain approval for the construction or modification of certain facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, comply with stringent air permit requirements and also utilize equipment or technologies to control emissions. Obtaining such permits could delay our operations.
National Environmental Policy Act
Our operations on federal lands may be subject to the federal National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), which requires federal agencies, including the EPA, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. As part of such evaluations, an agency will conduct an environmental assessment that assesses the potential impacts of a proposed project and may require a detailed environmental impact statement for public review and comment. Our current and future operations on federal lands will be subject to NEPA, which could delay or impose additional conditions and costs on us. Moreover, this process could experience protest, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may impact our operations.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, comparable state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials attendant to our operations to our employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens.

Index to Financial Statements

Our processing plant operations are also subject to standards designed to ensure the safety of our processes, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s Process Safety Management standard, which is designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. The Process Safety Management standard imposes requirements on regulated entities related to managing these hazards. These requirements include conducting process hazard analyses for processes involving highly hazardous chemicals, developing detailed written operating procedures, including procedures for managing change, and evaluating the mechanical integrity of critical equipment.  We conduct periodic audits of Process Safety Management systems at each of our locations subject to this standard.
Hydraulic Fracturing
We perform hydraulic fracturing in horizontally drilled wells. Currently, most of our hydraulic fracturing activities are regulated at the state level as the EPA only has limited purview over fracturing activities. However, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority or pursued investigations over certain aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources “under some circumstances,” including water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater into surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits.
Climate Change Regulations and Legislation
Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at all levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”). These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources.
At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date. The EPA has, however, adopted regulations that, among other things, establish Potential for Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are already potential sources of significant pollutant emissions. Sources subject to these permitting requirements must meet “best available control technology” standards for those GHG emissions. Additionally, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified GHG emission sources in the United States, including, among others, onshore and offshore oil and gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, which include certain of our operations.
Federal agencies also directly regulate emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and gas operations. In August 2016, the EPA issued a final New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) rule, known as Subpart OOOOa, which requires certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and gas sector to reduce these methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards expand previously issued NSPS published by the EPA in 2012, and known as Subpart OOOO, by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices. 
Other Regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry
Our operations are also subject to various other types of regulation at the federal, state and local level. These types of regulations include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The state, and some counties and municipalities, in which we operate may also regulate:

• | the location of wells;


• | the method of drilling and casing wells;


• | the timing of conducting our activities, including seasonal wildlife closures;


• | the rates of production;


• | the surface use and restoration of properties where we operate;


• | the plugging and abandoning of wells;


• | interactions with surface owners and other third parties; and


• | abandonment of pipelines and midstream facilities.

State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and gas properties. We rely upon the Oklahoma “forced pooling” process to facilitate working interest owners’ participation in our operations.  Under this process, if a party proposes to drill the initial well to a particular formation in a specific drilling and spacing unit but cannot obtain the agreement of all other oil and gas interest holders and other leaseholders within the unit as to how the unit should be developed, the party may initiate “forced pooling”. Under current regulations, drilling and spacing units for our targeted horizons are based on a maximum of four to eight horizontal wells, depending on the formation, on a 640-acre section. In a forced pooling action, the proposed operator files an application for a pooling order with the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (“OCC”) and names all other persons with the right to drill the unit as respondents. The proposed operator is required to demonstrate that it has made a good faith effort to bargain with all of the respondents prior to filing its application. The fair value of the mineral interests in the unit is determined in an administrative proceeding by reference to market transactions involving nearby oil and gas rights, including nearby mineral lease costs. 
Assuming the application for a forced pooling order is granted, the respondents then have 20 days to elect either to participate in the proposed well or accept fair value for their interest, usually in the form of a cash payment, an overriding royalty, or some combination, based on the fair value established and approved through the administrative hearing. The pooling order typically addresses the time frame for drilling the well and provides for the manner in which future wells within the unit may be drilled. The applicant for the pooling order is ordinarily designated as the operator of the wells subject to the pooling order. 
The availability of forced pooling normally means that it is difficult for a small number of owners to block or delay the drilling of a particular well proposed by another interest holder. Oil and gas companies in Oklahoma generally attempt to lease as much of the mineral interests in a particular area as are readily available at acceptable rates, and then use the forced pooling process to proceed with the desired development of the well. In this manner, we have the ability to expand into and develop areas near our existing acreage even if we are unable to lease all of the mineral interests in those areas. 
The gross production tax, or severance tax, is a value-based tax levied at a basic rate of 7% upon the production of oil and gas in Oklahoma. As an economic incentive to develop its resources, Oklahoma has historically offered a “tax holiday” with rates ranging from 1% for 48 months to 2% for 36 months for production from horizontal wells. Through June 2018, Oklahoma imposed a tax of 2% of gross production for the first 36 months of production and then at 7% thereafter on wells drilled after July 1, 2015. Effective July 2018, the 2% tax rate was increased to 5% for wells drilled after July 1, 2015 that were still within their first 36 months of production. For the period beyond 36 months, the tax rate remains at 7% for the remaining productive life of each well. All wells drilled after July 1, 2018 are taxed at 5% of gross production for the first 36 months of production and then at 7% thereafter. In addition, a longstanding excise tax of 0.095% continues to be levied.
Federal, state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells, closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas where we operate. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and many other state and local authorities also have regulations covering these procedures. Some state agencies and municipalities have binding requirements related thereto.
Regulation of Natural Gas Sales and Transportation
The rates, terms and conditions applicable to the interstate transportation of oil and natural gas liquids by pipelines are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”), as common carriers, under the Interstate Commerce Act. The FERC has implemented a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for interstate oil and natural gas liquids pipelines to fulfill the requirements of Title XVIII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 comprised of an indexing system to establish ceilings on interstate oil and natural gas liquids pipeline rates. Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors.
The pipelines used to gather and transport natural gas being produced by us are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992, as reauthorized and amended (“Pipeline Safety Act”), and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011. The DOT Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) has established a risk-based approach to determine which gathering pipelines are subject to regulation and what safety standards regulated gathering pipelines must meet. In March 2016, the PHMSA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to revise the Pipeline

Safety Regulations applicable to the safety of onshore gas transmission and gathering pipelines, including both high consequence areas (“HCAs”) and non-HCAs.
Any transportation of our crude oil, natural gas liquids and purity components (ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane and natural gasoline) by rail is also subject to regulation by the DOT’s PHMSA, and the DOT’s Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”) under the Hazardous Materials Regulations at 49 CFR Parts 171-180, including Emergency Orders by the FRA and new regulations being proposed by the PHMSA, arising due to the consequences of train accidents and the increase in the rail transportation of flammable liquids. In October 2015, the PHMSA issued proposed new safety regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines, including a requirement that all hazardous liquid pipelines have a system for detecting leaks and establish a timeline for inspections of affected pipelines following extreme weather events or natural disasters.
Gathering Pipeline Regulation
Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”), exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the FERC under the NGA. We believe that our Midstream assets meet the tests the FERC has used to determine exemption from its jurisdiction.
Other
The oil and gas industry is also subject to other federal, state and local regulations and laws relating to resource conservation and employment standards.
Employees
As of June 28, 2019, we had 154 full-time employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. 
Insurance
We maintain customary insurance against some, but not all, of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. We currently have policies in place that cover general liability (includes sudden and accidental pollution), physical damage to our assets, control of wells, auto liability, worker’s compensation and employer’s liability.
We regularly execute master services contracts with our third-party vendors, suppliers and contractors in which they agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of their employees and contractors. Similarly, we generally agree to indemnify them against claims made by our other vendors, suppliers, contractors and employees. Additionally, each party generally is responsible for damage to its own property.
