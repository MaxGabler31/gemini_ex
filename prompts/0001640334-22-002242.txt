Item 1. Description of Business. 
Our Company

This annual report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may”, “should”, “expects”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks in the section entitled “Risk Factors” that may cause our or our industry’s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. 

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. 

Our financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 

In this annual report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to “common shares” refer to the common shares in our capital stock. 

As used in this current report and unless otherwise indicated, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” and "Caro" mean Caro Holdings Inc., unless otherwise indicated. 

Our History

Our company was incorporated on March 29, 2016 in the State of Nevada. We had been engaged in the subscription box business with our initial focus on offering sock subscriptions to our customers. Our subscription box was a package of a pair of socks that will be sent directly to a customer on a recurring basis. For example, a potential subscriber would subscribe to receive a pair of socks once a month for either a period of 6 months or 12 months. Our subscription sock boxes were a marketing strategy and a method of product distribution, allowing us to target a wide range of customers and cater to their variety of specific needs and interests. We are a small early-stage development company. To date, our company's activities have been limited to the sourcing of our advertising channels, initial branding efforts, and in our formation and the raising of equity capital. We have no revenues and have limited cash on hand. We have sustained losses since inception and have relied upon loans from directors and officers and the sale of our securities for funding. We have never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or involved in any kind of legal proceeding.

Revenue

We had no revenue for the year ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.

Our Current Business 

We are now engaged in the development of our Direct To Consumer systems and methodologies where we analyze the marketplace and work with mid-size brands that have a strong bricks and mortar presence, and have a desire to increase their digital presence. 

Our Direct to Consumer System (D2C) will be a fully integrated, end-to-end system that allows full control of data that provides insight from multiple channels so together with our clients successful marketing decisions can be based on the entire business' performance. Based on these analytics, the system can immediately deploy personalization and optimization independently and readily understand how customer interactions vary across different regions. Furthermore, we believe we have the necessary infrastructure to take advantage of growth opportunities with minimal additional costs.

Inventory 

The Company does not currently have any inventory on hand. 

Status of Any Publicly Announced New Product or Service

We have not developed any new or unique products or services that have not already been announced. 

Government Regulation 

We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of our Internet or e-commerce services. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile communications, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, the provision of e-commerce payment services, unencumbered Internet communications, consumer protection, the provision of e-commerce payment services, unencumbered Internet access to our services, the design and operation of websites and the characteristics and quality of products and services. It is not clear how certain existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. Unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our costs of doing business. In addition, we may be subject to international trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the activities and regulations of the World Trade Organization. We believe that we are in conformity with all applicable laws in the United States and the Philippines. While we believe that our operations are in compliance with all applicable regulations, there can be no assurances that from time to time unintentional violations of such regulations will not occur. 
Cost and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws 

Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of material into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We believe the nature of our operations have little, if any, environmental impact. We therefore anticipate no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for our current fiscal year or for the near future. Our Employees We have no employees. Our sole officer and director furnishes their time to the development of our company at no cost. We do not foresee hiring any employees in the near future. We will engage independent contractors to help design and develop our website and marketing efforts.
Acquisition Interest

As part of our investigation, we expect to meet personally with management and key personnel, visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis of verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of our limited financial resources and management expertise. The manner in which we participate in an opportunity will depend on the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of both parties, and the management of the opportunity.

With respect to any merger or acquisition, and depending upon, among other things, the target company’s assets and liabilities, our stockholders will in all likelihood hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in us following any merger or acquisition. The percentage ownership may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with assets and expectations of growth. Any merger or acquisition can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our stockholders.

We will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written business agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally we anticipate that such agreements will (i) require specific representations and warranties by all of the parties; (ii) specify certain events of default; (iii) detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties prior to and after such closing; (iv) outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with the Company’s attorneys and accountants; (v) set forth remedies on defaults; and (vi) include miscellaneous other terms.

As stated above, we will not acquire or merge with any entity which cannot provide independent audited financial statements within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within time parameters necessary to insure our compliance within the requirements of the 1934 Act, or if the audited financial statements provided do not conform to the representations made by that business to be acquired, the definitive closing documents will provide that the proposed transaction will be voidable, at the discretion of our present management. If such transaction is voided, the definitive closing documents will also contain a provision providing for reimbursement for our costs associated with the proposed transaction.

Investment Company Act 1940

Although we will be subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the 1934 Act, we believe we will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) insofar as we will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities. In the event we engage in business combinations that result in us holding passive investment interests in a number of entities, we could be subject to regulation under the 1940 Act. In such event, we would be required to register as an investment company and incur significant registration and compliance costs. We have obtained no formal determination from the SEC as to our status under the 1940 Act and, consequently, any violation of the 1940 Act would subject us to material adverse consequences. We believe that, currently, we are exempt under Regulation 3a-2 of the 1940 Act.
Intellectual Property

We own no intellectual property.

Employees

We presently have no full time executive, operational or clerical staff.  

Factors Effecting Future Performance

Rather than an operating business, our goal is to obtain debt and/or equity financing to meet our ongoing operating expenses and attempt to merge with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock to create value for our shareholders.

Although there is no assurance that this series of events will be successfully completed, we believe we can successfully complete an acquisition or merger which will enable us to continue as a going concern. Any acquisition or merger will most likely be dilutive to our existing stockholders.
