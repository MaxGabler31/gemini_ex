For these customers we develop tools such as plant management platforms, energy saving applications, inventory management mechanisms, connected vehicle platforms and undertake various industry specific aspects of intelligent automation and operational efficiency. These customers are included in our Emerging Verticals, which are further discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Customers
We maintain a geographically diverse client base in multiple industries. Our focus on delivering quality service is reflected in established relationships with many of our customers, with 53.8% and 26.5% of our revenues in 2021 coming from customers that had used our services for at least five and ten years, respectively. Our sustained growth and increased capabilities are furthered by both organic growth and strategic acquisitions. We continually evaluate potential acquisition targets that can expand our vertical-specific domain expertise, geographic footprint, service portfolio, client base and management expertise. 
As we remain committed to diversifying our client base and adding more customers to our client mix, we expect revenue concentration from our top customers to continue to decrease over the long-term. During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the economic landscape and influenced business decisions of our existing and potential customers. We were able to capitalize on demand for our services at our larger customers whereas we realized less revenue growth from our small customers. During 2021, we continued to diversify our customer base and decrease our concentration from our top customers. The following table shows revenues from the top five and ten customers in the respective year as a percentage of revenues for that year:

 | % of Revenues for Year Ended December 31,
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Top five customers | 18.2 | % | | 22.0 | % | 19.9 | %
Top ten customers | 25.7 | % | | 30.9 | % | 29.1 | %

See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to revenues. 
See Note 16 “Segment Information” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding long-lived assets and customer revenues by geographic location as well as financial information related to our reportable segments.
Global Delivery Model
We believe the development of a robust global delivery model creates a key competitive advantage, enabling us to better understand and meet our customers’ diverse needs and to provide a compelling value proposition. We continuously grow our delivery platform both organically and through strategically acquired locations and personnel with diversified skills that support our strategy. We had 52,617 delivery personnel as of December 31, 2021, which mainly includes our core information technology professionals as well as designers, consultants and scientists. 
We serve our customers through on-site, off-site and offshore locations across the world and use strategically located delivery centers to offer a strong, diversified and cost-effective delivery platform. Our largest delivery centers are located in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia and our delivery model has not been materially affected by the political and economic uncertainty in these locations. 
As of December 31, 2021, in our largest delivery locations we had 12,389 delivery professionals located in Ukraine, 9,416 delivery professionals located in Belarus and 8,933 delivery professionals located in Russia. These locations are well-positioned to serve as main IT outsourcing destinations given their availability of qualified software engineers, established educational infrastructure, strong industrial base and government support for the technology industry through various long-term tax incentives in select jurisdictions. 
Our other significant locations with delivery professionals are India with 4,349, Poland with 3,055, the United States with 2,757, Hungary with 1,991 and Mexico with 1,018 as of December 31, 2021. 
Human Capital 
Our more than 58,000 employees are a key factor in our ability to grow our revenues and serve our customers. We believe the quality of our employees serves as a key point of differentiation in how we deliver a superior value proposition to our customers and investors. Therefore, it is critical to our success that we are able to identify, attract, hire and retain delivery professionals who are highly skilled in information technology to execute our services, as well as individuals with appropriate skills to fill our executive, finance, legal, human resources and other key management positions. To attract, retain and motivate our employees, we offer a challenging work environment, a culture that values the individual, ongoing skills development initiatives, attractive career advancement with continuous rotation and promotion opportunities while providing an environment and culture that rewards entrepreneurial initiative and performance. As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we had a total of 58,824, 41,168, and 36,739 employees, respectively, of which 52,617, 36,737, and 32,561, respectively, were delivery professionals. 
Health, Safety, and Wellness: We invest in programs designed to improve the physical, mental, and social well-being of our employees so we can offer a safe, welcoming, and productive workplace. Our health and safety programs are designed to comply with the regulations in the multiple cities and countries where we operate, but also provide working conditions designed to be compatible with the working necessities of our delivery and administrative operations. In response to the continued unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic, we adapted our remote and onsite working policies to conform with current public health guidance. A vast majority of our employees continue to work from home, but for those who choose or need to work in an office setting, we have implemented safety measures and developed policies or refined safe working technologies for those employees who work in our or our customers’ facilities.
Recognizing that the lingering uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and remote work could continue to significantly disrupt the work-life balance and wellness of our employees, we increased employee awareness of the programs we offer to support and enhance our employees’ mental, financial, and physical well-being and provided parenting and caregiver resources.

Recruitment, Training and Utilization: As an innovation-driven business in a competitive industry, our success depends on hiring the most talented employees, training and developing that talent, and deploying them to satisfy customer demand. We have dedicated full-time employees who oversee all aspects of our human capital management process including talent acquisition teams to locate and attract qualified and experienced professionals around the world. Our employees are a critical asset, necessary for our continued success and, therefore, we are continuously exploring new geographies, markets, and sources to locate talented personnel and appealing to them with competitive compensation programs and educational opportunities. 
We actively monitor how we utilize our delivery professionals and specialists to balance the needs of our customers with the availability, location, and skill sets of our employees and their need for diverse and challenging work. We manage utilization through strategic hiring and efficient staffing of projects for our customers. As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the annual utilization rates of our delivery professionals were approximately 78.7%, 79.8%, and 78.0%, respectively. 
EPAM invests significant resources in training and developing our employees through our learning and development programs. Our largest learning and development investment has been directed towards developing our engineering talent, including targeted training programs, innovation labs, and significant internal production projects. Our employees consumed over 3.7 million learning hours in 2021 and we were awarded LinkedIn’s Best Culture of Learning Talent Award for 2021. We deliver training and development opportunities and content through our unique learning ecosystem that promotes learning in the daily workflow to improve retention and productivity, and through dedicated events, including our week-long global learning event, which delivered approximately 100 online sessions. 
We deliver learning and development content through proprietary platforms that make learning and development content easily available to all of our employees. Our digital learning platform provides our employees with an interface to meet our employees’ learning and training needs and includes a recommendation engine that suggests courses and materials based on employee role, level, location and skills. Our electronic library platform makes books and publications available to all of our employees and we celebrate learning achievements through our recognition portal, where we promote our employees’ learning accomplishments and employees can recognize each other for their teamwork, initiative, and unique, valuable skills.
Diversity and Inclusion: EPAM provides our customers with the skills of our talented personnel, which includes people with varied and diverse backgrounds and characteristics, to drive innovation and thought diversity in delivering our services. We believe that innovation comes from the unique perspectives, knowledge, and experiences of our global employees, so we strive to create inclusivity by offering comprehensive language learning programs, highlighting and sharing our varied cultures, and empowering women and underrepresented groups to celebrate their achievements in the workplace. 
Increasing diversity in executive and key operational leadership roles is an organizational priority that starts at the top of our organization. Women currently represent approximately 29% of the independent directors on our Board and we have developed programs to identify, retain, mentor, and supply a pipeline of qualified, diverse candidates at all levels of our company. Our programs include dedicating resources and personnel in our talent acquisition team to identify, recognize, and use diverse and inclusive sources for hiring, including associating with organizations that are focused on promoting underrepresented groups in engineering, IT, and business. Our Emerging Engineers Lab is an internship program for entry-level talent sourced from a variety of diverse technology programs across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. We also supplemented our mandatory annual training with materials geared towards eliminating unconscious bias in our professional interactions and recognizing the value of diversity in organizational success.
Our employees have driven the creation of discussion forums focused on diversity and inclusion topics important to them and organized participation in global and local events, including International Women’s Day, Pride celebrations, and National Hispanic Heritage Month. Recognizing that improving the number of underrepresented people in the software and technology industries starts with access to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (“STEM”) education, EPAM has created post-secondary STEM education certification programs and is investing in universities that offer degree programs. We also created the EPAM E-KIDS program where our employees volunteer their time to teach elementary school age children of any gender, race, or ethnic identity STEM concepts and introductory software coding skills. As of the end of 2021, we offered the EPAM E-KIDS program in 14 countries.
Employee Engagement and Retention: We are committed to respecting our employees' fundamental human rights at work and accordingly are a participant in the United Nations Global Compact. We believe that retaining skilled talent requires substantially more than meeting basic employment and labor rights, and that employees who are fairly compensated, feel supported in their career development, and are engaged with their employer are more likely to remain with that employer. That is why we strive to provide pay and benefits that demonstrate the value of our employees to us, including a competitive salary, flexible work-life balance, paid time off, health coverage, ongoing training programs, relocation options, and recognition opportunities for open source software contributions.

Our career development programs create detailed and progressive training plans for our employees and help them choose from internal and external training options, mentoring programs, and hands-on opportunities to experience emerging technology areas. We designed our career development programs to enable our employees to develop their engineering skills, influence our culture, develop thought leadership, and introduce them to leaders in our industry. Our career development programs also give our employees opportunities to earn accreditation and relevant expertise in various technology fields, including software and project management certifications and recognition and credentialing from the industry’s primary software and cloud services providers.
Our focus on our employees’ experience is recognized inside and outside of EPAM. In 2021, EPAM was awarded Great Place to Work certifications in India, Poland, and Singapore, named in the top three Most Attractive Employers in the technology industry category by PwC in Hungary, and named on Newsweek’s list of Top 100 Most Loved Workplaces. We focus on retaining and engaging top talent by hiring people with the skill sets our customers need and who also share our values so we can build long-term employee satisfaction, which is evidenced by our voluntary attrition rate of 13.3%, 10.8%, and 13.3% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
We endeavor to recruit for careers, not for short-term projects, and actively foster feedback from our employees so we can improve the EPAM employee experience. Our employees have demonstrated their satisfaction with our approach by giving their highest percentage of positive responses in our 2021 employee survey when asked if their manager demonstrates a commitment to building a trusting work environment (95%), and if they feel that EPAM provides a supportive environment for all employees, regardless of location, level, function, gender, age, race, ethnicity, or disability (94%). Receiving and learning from employee feedback plays a critical role in engaging and retaining our employees because it offers us an opportunity to improve our operations and for our employees to continually enhance their skills. 
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our services through our senior management, sales and business development teams, account managers, and professional staff. Our client service professionals and account managers, who maintain direct customer relationships, play an integral role in engaging with current customers to identify and pursue potential business opportunities. This strategy has been effective in promoting repeat business and growth from within our existing customer base and we believe that our reputation as a reliable provider of software engineering solutions drives additional business from inbound requests and referrals. In addition to effective client management, our sales model also utilizes an integrated sales and marketing approach that leverages a dedicated sales team to identify and acquire new accounts. 
We maintain a marketing team, which coordinates corporate-level branding efforts such as participation in and hosting of industry conferences and events as well as sponsorship of programming competitions. We have been recognized by many top global independent research agencies, such as Forrester and Gartner and by publications such as Newsweek, Forbes and Fortune.
Competition
The markets in which we compete are changing rapidly and we face competition from both global technology solutions providers as well as those based primarily in specific geographies with lower cost labor such as Eastern Europe, India and China. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include technical expertise and industry knowledge, end-to-end solution offerings, a reputation for and a track record of high-quality and on-time delivery of work, effective employee recruiting, training and retention, responsiveness to customers’ business needs, ability to scale, financial stability and price.
We face competition from various technology services providers such as Accenture, Atos, Capgemini, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Deloitte Digital, DXC Technology, Endava, Genpact, GlobalLogic, Globant, Grid Dynamics, HCL Technologies, Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro, among others. Additionally, we compete with numerous smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which we operate.
We believe that our focus on complex and innovative software product development solutions, our technical employee base, and our development and continuous improvement in process methodologies, applications and tools position us well to compete effectively in the future.

Quality Management and Information Security 
We are continuously investing in applications, tools and infrastructure to manage all aspects of our global delivery process in order to manage quality and information security risks, while providing control and visibility across all project lifecycle stages both internally and to our customers. We maintain, monitor, and improve processes and infrastructure to protect our, our customers’ and their customers’ confidential and sensitive information and allocate internal and external resources to assess and ensure information security, cybersecurity and data privacy. We have made significant investments in the appropriate people, processes and technology to establish and manage information security, confidentiality requirements, and laws and regulations governing our activities, such as the European Union data protection legal framework referred to as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and others.
We focus on establishing stringent security, privacy and quality standards as well as internal controls and meet with ISO 27001:2013, ISO 27701:2019, ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 13485:2016. We are an ISAE 3402 Type 2 certified IT services provider. This certification is issued by an auditor in compliance with the globally recognized assurance standard. The certification, along with others we hold, provide our customers with independent third-party verification of our information security, quality management and general controls practices.
We have developed sophisticated project management techniques facilitated through our proprietary project management tools, a web-based collaborative environment for software development, which we consider critical for visibility into project deliverables, resource management, team messaging and project-related documents. These tools promote collaboration and effective oversight, reduce work time and costs, and increase quality for our IT management and our customers. 
Corporate and Social Responsibility and Environmental, Social, and Governance Initiatives
We are committed to integrating positive social, environmental and ethical practices into our business operations, corporate governance, and strategy. This commitment is key to our continual development as a business and drives value for our employees, customers, business partners, the community and other stakeholders. We practice the principles established in our Code of Ethical Conduct by making positive contributions to the communities in which we operate and championing corporate social responsibility efforts. 
Through our focused efforts in the areas of Education, Environment, and Community, we are committed to sharing the expertise and attributes of our highly skilled global workforce to effectively support the needs of, and positively add to the world at large and the communities where we work and live. By understanding our impact on local, regional and global communities, we strive to create positive change and opportunities in areas where it is needed most. 
We believe responsible stewardship of the environment is critical, and we take this responsibility seriously. We continually strive to improve our environmental performance through implementation of sustainable development and environmental practices including recycling and upcycling electronics and computers, designing and releasing a carbon footprint calculator to our employees and the general public, and building new offices according to the conservation standards of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating system. 
Intellectual Property
Protecting our intellectual property rights is important to our business. We have invested, and will continue to invest, in research and development to enhance our knowledge, create solutions for our customers, and continuously advance our information security. We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, trade secrets, cybersecurity, and confidentiality obligations to protect our intellectual property. We require our employees, vendors and independent contractors to enter into written agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us, which assign to us all deliverable intellectual property and work product made, developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment or provision of services and to keep any disclosed information confidential.
We also enter into confidentiality agreements with our customers and suppliers to protect information and maintain information security. Our agreements with our customers cover our use of their software systems and platforms as our customers usually own the intellectual property in the software, products, and solutions we develop for them. Furthermore, we often grant our customers a nonexclusive license to use relevant technologies in our pre-existing intellectual property portfolio, but only to the extent necessary to use the software or systems we develop for them. Our suppliers are generally bound by our supplier code of conduct, which imposes an obligation to protect our and our customers’ intangible assets, including confidential information, personal information, and intellectual property, and to protect the security of those assets.

Regulations
Due to the industry and geographic diversity of our operations and services, our operations are subject to a variety of rules and regulations. Several foreign and U.S. federal and state agencies regulate various aspects of our business. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Regulation and Legislation and Risks Related to Information Security and Data Protection.” We are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other countries in which we operate, including export restrictions, economic sanctions, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and similar anti-corruption laws and data privacy regulations. Compliance with these laws requires significant resources and non-compliance may result in civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures.
