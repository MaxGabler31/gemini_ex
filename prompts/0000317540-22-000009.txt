Item 1.Business.
Introduction
Coca‑Cola Consolidated, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its majority-owned subsidiaries, “Coca‑Cola Consolidated,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), distributes, markets and manufactures nonalcoholic beverages in territories spanning 14 states and the District of Columbia. The Company was incorporated in 1980 and, together with its predecessors, has been in the nonalcoholic beverage manufacturing and distribution business since 1902. We are the largest Coca‑Cola bottler in the United States. Approximately 83% of our total bottle/can sales volume to retail customers consists of products of The Coca‑Cola Company, which include some of the most recognized and popular beverage brands in the world. We also distribute products for several other beverage companies, including Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (“Dr Pepper”) and Monster Energy Company (“Monster Energy”). Our purpose is to honor God in all we do, serve others, pursue excellence and grow profitably.
Ownership
J. Frank Harrison, III, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, together with the trustees of certain trusts established for the benefit of certain relatives of the late J. Frank Harrison, Jr., control shares representing approximately 86% of the total voting power of the Company’s total outstanding Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a consolidated basis. As of December 31, 2021, The Coca‑Cola Company owned shares of the Company’s Common Stock representing approximately 5% of the total voting power of the Company’s Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a consolidated basis. The number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock currently held by The Coca‑Cola Company gives it the right to have a designee proposed by the Company for nomination to the Company’s Board of Directors in the Company’s annual proxy statement. J. Frank Harrison, III and the trustees of the J. Frank Harrison, Jr. family trusts described above, have agreed to vote the shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock that they control in favor of such designee. The Coca‑Cola Company does not own any shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock.
Beverage Products
We offer a range of nonalcoholic beverage products and flavors, including both sparkling and still beverages, designed to meet the demands of our consumers. Sparkling beverages are carbonated beverages and the Company’s principal sparkling beverage is Coca‑Cola. Still beverages include energy products and noncarbonated beverages such as bottled water, ready to drink tea, ready to drink coffee, enhanced water, juices and sports drinks. 
Our sales are divided into two main categories: (i) bottle/can sales and (ii) other sales. Bottle/can sales include products packaged primarily in plastic bottles and aluminum cans. Other sales include sales to other Coca‑Cola bottlers, “post-mix” products, transportation revenue and equipment maintenance revenue. Post-mix products are dispensed through equipment that mixes fountain syrups with carbonated or still water, enabling fountain retailers to sell finished products to consumers in cups or glasses.
The following table sets forth some of our principal products, including products of The Coca‑Cola Company and products licensed to us by other beverage companies:

Beverage Distribution and Manufacturing Agreements
We have rights to distribute, promote, market and sell certain nonalcoholic beverages of The Coca‑Cola Company pursuant to comprehensive beverage agreements (collectively, the “CBA”) with The Coca‑Cola Company and Coca‑Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (“CCR”), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Coca‑Cola Company. The CBA requires the Company to make quarterly sub-bottling payments to CCR on a continuing basis in exchange for the grant of exclusive rights to distribute, promote, market and sell the authorized brands of The Coca‑Cola Company and related products in certain of the Company’s distribution territories. In addition to customary termination and default rights, the CBA requires us to make minimum, ongoing capital expenditures in our distribution business and to meet certain minimum volume requirements, gives The Coca‑Cola Company certain approval and other rights in connection with a sale of the Company or of the distribution business of the Company and prohibits us from producing, manufacturing, preparing, packaging, distributing, selling, dealing in or otherwise using or handling any beverages, beverage components or other beverage products other than the beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company and certain expressly permitted cross-licensed brands without the consent of The Coca-Cola Company.
We also have rights to manufacture, produce and package certain beverages bearing trademarks of The Coca‑Cola Company at our manufacturing plants pursuant to a regional manufacturing agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company entered into on March 31, 2017 (as amended, the “RMA”). We may distribute these beverages for our own account in accordance with the CBA or may sell them to certain other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers or to The Coca‑Cola Company in accordance with the RMA. For prices determined pursuant to the RMA, The Coca‑Cola Company unilaterally establishes from time to time the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, that the Company charges for these sales to certain other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers or to The Coca‑Cola Company. The RMA contains provisions similar to those contained in the CBA restricting the sale of the Company or the manufacturing business of the Company, requiring minimum, ongoing capital expenditures in our manufacturing business, prohibiting us from manufacturing any beverages, beverage components or other beverage products other than the beverages and beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company and certain expressly permitted cross-licensed brands without the consent of The Coca‑Cola Company and allowing for the termination of the RMA.
In addition to our agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR, we also have rights to manufacture and/or distribute certain beverage brands owned by other beverage companies, including Dr Pepper and Monster Energy, pursuant to agreements with such other beverage companies. Our distribution agreements with Dr Pepper permit us to distribute Dr Pepper beverage brands, as well as certain post-mix products of Dr Pepper. Certain of our agreements with Dr Pepper also authorize us to manufacture certain Dr Pepper beverage brands. Our distribution agreements with Monster Energy grant us the rights to distribute certain products offered, packaged and/or marketed by Monster Energy. Similar to the CBA, these beverage agreements contain restrictions on the use of trademarks and approved bottles, cans and labels and the sale of imitations or substitutes, as well as provisions for their termination for cause or upon the occurrence of other events defined in these agreements. Sales of beverages under these agreements with other beverage companies represented approximately 17%, 16% and 15% of our bottle/can sales volume to retail customers in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Finished Goods Supply Arrangements
We have finished goods supply arrangements with other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers to sell and buy finished goods bearing trademarks owned by The Coca‑Cola Company and produced by us in accordance with the RMA or produced by a selling U.S. Coca‑Cola bottler in accordance with a similar regional manufacturing authorization held by such bottler. Pursuant to the RMA, The Coca‑Cola Company unilaterally establishes from time to time the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, for such finished goods. In most instances, the Company’s ability to negotiate the prices at which it sells finished goods bearing trademarks owned by The Coca‑Cola Company to, and the prices at which it purchases such finished goods from, other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers is limited pursuant to these pricing provisions.
Other Agreements Related to the Coca‑Cola System
We have other agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company, CCR and other Coca‑Cola bottlers regarding product supply, information technology services and other aspects of the North American Coca‑Cola system, as described below. Many of these agreements involve system governance structures that require the Company’s management to closely collaborate and align with other participating bottlers in order to successfully implement Coca‑Cola system plans and strategies.
Incidence-Based Pricing Agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company
The Company has an incidence-based pricing agreement with The Coca‑Cola Company, which establishes the prices charged by The Coca‑Cola Company to the Company for (i) concentrates of sparkling and certain still beverages produced by the Company and (ii) certain purchased still beverages. Under the incidence-based pricing agreement, the prices charged by The Coca‑Cola Company 
are impacted by a number of factors, including the incidence rate in effect, our pricing and sales of finished products, the channels in which the finished products are sold, the package mix and, in the case of products sold by The Coca‑Cola Company to us in finished form, the cost of goods for certain elements used in such products. The Coca‑Cola Company has no rights under the incidence-based pricing agreement to establish the prices, or the elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, at which we sell products, but does have the right to establish certain pricing under other agreements, including the RMA.
National Product Supply Governance Agreement
We are a member of a national product supply group (the “NPSG”), which is comprised of The Coca‑Cola Company, the Company and certain other Coca‑Cola bottlers who are regional producing bottlers in The Coca‑Cola Company’s national product supply system (collectively with the Company, the “NPSG Members”), pursuant to a national product supply governance agreement executed in 2015 with The Coca‑Cola Company and certain other Coca‑Cola bottlers (as amended, the “NPSG Agreement”). The stated objectives of the NPSG include, among others, (i) Coca‑Cola system strategic infrastructure investment and divestment planning; (ii) network optimization of plant to distribution center sourcing; and (iii) new product or packaging infrastructure planning.
Under the NPSG Agreement, the NPSG Members established certain governance mechanisms, including a governing board (the “NPSG Board”) comprised of representatives of certain NPSG Members. The NPSG Board makes and/or oversees and directs certain key decisions regarding the NPSG. Subject to the terms and conditions of the NPSG Agreement, each NPSG Member is required to comply with certain key decisions made by the NPSG Board, which include decisions regarding strategic infrastructure investment and divestment planning, optimal national product supply sourcing and new product or packaging infrastructure planning. We are also obligated to pay a certain portion of the costs of operating the NPSG.
CONA Services LLC
We are a member of CONA Services LLC (“CONA”), an entity formed with The Coca‑Cola Company and certain other Coca‑Cola bottlers to provide business process and information technology services to its members. We are party to an amended and restated master services agreement with CONA, pursuant to which CONA agreed to make available, and we became authorized to use, the Coke One North America system (the “CONA System”), a uniform information technology system developed to promote operational efficiency and uniformity among North American Coca‑Cola bottlers. As part of making the CONA System available to us, CONA provides us with certain business process and information technology services, including the planning, development, management and operation of the CONA System in connection with our direct store delivery and manufacture of products. In exchange for our rights to use the CONA System and receive CONA-related services, we are charged service fees by CONA, which we are obligated to pay even if we are not using the CONA System for all or any portion of our distribution and manufacturing operations.
Amended and Restated Ancillary Business Letter
On March 31, 2017, we entered into an amended and restated ancillary business letter with The Coca‑Cola Company (the “Ancillary Business Letter”), pursuant to which we were granted advance waivers to acquire or develop certain lines of business involving the preparation, distribution, sale, dealing in or otherwise using or handling of certain beverage products that would otherwise be prohibited under the CBA.
Under the Ancillary Business Letter, the consent of The Coca‑Cola Company, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, would be required for us to acquire or develop (i) any grocery, quick service restaurant, or convenience and petroleum store business engaged in the sale of beverages, beverage components and other beverage products not otherwise authorized or permitted by the CBA or (ii) any other line of business for which beverage activities otherwise prohibited under the CBA represent more than a certain threshold of net sales (subject to certain limited exceptions).
Markets Served and Facilities
As of December 31, 2021, we served approximately 60 million consumers within our territories, which comprised five principal markets. Certain information regarding each of these markets follows:

Total | | 10 | 60 

The Company is also a shareholder of South Atlantic Canners, Inc. (“SAC”), a manufacturing cooperative managed by the Company. SAC is located in Bishopville, South Carolina, and the Company utilizes a portion of the production capacity from the Bishopville manufacturing plant.
Raw Materials
In addition to concentrates purchased from The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies for use in our beverage manufacturing, we also purchase sweetener, carbon dioxide, plastic bottles, cans, closures and other packaging materials, as well as equipment for the distribution, marketing and production of nonalcoholic beverages.
We purchase all of the plastic bottles used in our manufacturing plants from Southeastern Container and Western Container, two manufacturing cooperatives we co-own with several other Coca‑Cola bottlers, and a majority of our aluminum cans from two domestic suppliers. We began sourcing aluminum cans from international locations in 2020, and we may continue to change our sourcing model in the future in order to ensure an adequate supply of aluminum cans at commercially favorable prices.
Along with all other Coca‑Cola bottlers in the United States and Canada, we are a member of Coca-Cola Bottlers’ Sales & Services Company LLC (“CCBSS”), which was formed to provide certain procurement and other services with the intention of enhancing the efficiency and competitiveness of the Coca‑Cola bottling system. CCBSS negotiates the procurement for the majority of our raw materials, excluding concentrate, and we receive a rebate from CCBSS for the purchase of these raw materials.
We are exposed to price risk on commodities such as aluminum, corn and PET resin (a petroleum- or plant-based product), which affects the cost of raw materials used in the production of our finished products. We both produce and procure these finished products. Examples of the raw materials affected are aluminum cans and plastic bottles used for packaging and high fructose corn syrup used as a product ingredient. Further, we are exposed to commodity price risk on crude oil, which impacts our cost of fuel used in the movement and delivery of our products. We participate in commodity hedging and risk mitigation programs, including programs

administered by CCBSS and programs we administer. In addition, other than as discussed above, there are no limits on the prices The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate.
Customers and Marketing
The Company’s products are sold and distributed in the United States through various channels, which include selling directly to customers, including grocery stores, mass merchandise stores, club stores, convenience stores and drug stores, selling to on-premise locations, where products are typically consumed immediately, such as restaurants, schools, amusement parks and recreational facilities, and selling through other channels such as vending machine outlets. During 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer demand shifted from products sold for immediate consumption through smaller retail stores and on-premise locations to take-home products sold in grocery stores, mass merchandise stores and club stores. During 2021, as the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on economic activity abated, consumer demand increased for products sold for immediate consumption compared to 2020, although it remains somewhat lower than levels experienced prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The following table summarizes the percentage of the Company’s total bottle/can sales volume to its largest customers, as well as the percentage of the Company’s total net sales that such volume represents:

 | Fiscal Year
 | 2021 | | 2020
Approximate percent of the Company’s total bottle/can sales volume: | | | 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. | 20 | % | | 19 | %
The Kroger Company | 13 | % | | 13 | %
Total approximate percent of the Company’s total bottle/can sales volume | 33 | % | | 32 | %
Approximate percent of the Company’s total net sales: | | | 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. | 14 | % | | 14 | %
The Kroger Company | 9 | % | | 10 | %
Total approximate percent of the Company’s total net sales | | % | | | %

The loss of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or The Kroger Company as a customer could have a material adverse effect on the operating and financial results of the Company. No other customer represented greater than 10% of the Company’s total net sales or would impose a material adverse effect on the operating or financial results of the Company should they cease to be a customer of the Company.
New brand and product introductions, packaging changes and sales promotions are the primary sales and marketing practices in the nonalcoholic beverage industry and have required, and are expected to continue to require, substantial expenditures. Recent introductions include BODYARMOR Edge, Dr Pepper Zero Sugar, glacéau smartwater wellness portfolio, certain new flavors of Coca-Cola with Coffee, and certain new flavors of Dunkin’ Donuts iced coffee.
We sell our products primarily in single-use bottles and cans, in varying package configurations from market to market. For example, there may be up to 24 different packages for Diet Coke within a single geographic area. Bottle/can sales volume to retail customers during 2021 was approximately 52% bottles and 48% cans.
We rely extensively on advertising in various media outlets, primarily online, television and radio, for the marketing of our products. The Coca‑Cola Company, Dr Pepper and Monster Energy make substantial expenditures on advertising programs in our territories from which we benefit. Although The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies have provided us with marketing funding support in the past, our beverage agreements generally do not obligate such funding.
We also expend substantial funds on our own behalf for extensive local sales promotions of our products. Historically, these expenses have been partially offset by marketing funding support provided to us by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies in support of a variety of marketing programs, such as point-of-sale displays and merchandising programs. We consider the funds we expend for marketing and merchandising programs necessary to maintain or increase revenue.
In addition to our marketing and merchandising programs, we believe a sustained and planned charitable giving program to support the communities we serve is an essential component to the success of our brand and, by extension, our net sales. In 2021, the Company made cash donations of approximately $22.5 million to various charities and donor-advised funds in light of the Company’s financial performance, distribution territory footprint and future business prospects. The Company intends to continue its charitable contributions in future years, subject to the Company’s financial performance and other business factors.
Seasonality
Business seasonality results primarily from higher unit sales of the Company’s products in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year, as sales of our products are typically correlated with warmer weather. We believe that we and other manufacturers from whom we purchase finished products have adequate production capacity to meet sales demand for sparkling and still beverages during these peak periods. See “Item 2. Properties” for information relating to utilization of our manufacturing plants. Sales volume can also be impacted by weather conditions. Fixed costs, such as depreciation expense, are not significantly impacted by business seasonality.
Competition
The nonalcoholic beverage industry is highly competitive for both sparkling and still beverages. Our competitors include bottlers and distributors of nationally and regionally advertised and marketed products, as well as bottlers and distributors of private label beverages. Our principal competitors include local bottlers of PepsiCo, Inc. products and, in some regions, local bottlers of Dr Pepper products.
The principal methods of competition in the nonalcoholic beverage industry are new brand and product introductions, point-of-sale merchandising, new vending and dispensing equipment, packaging changes, pricing, sales promotions, product quality, retail space management, customer service, frequency of distribution and advertising. We believe we are competitive in our territories with respect to these methods of competition.
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local government agencies of the United States, including laws and regulations governing the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, packaging, labeling, content, quality and safety of our products, our occupational health and safety practices and the transportation and use of many of our products.
We are required to comply with a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, including, but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and various state laws governing food safety; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; the Lanham Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices; various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the National Labor Relations Act; and laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools.
As a manufacturer, distributor and seller of beverage products of The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies in exclusive territories, we are subject to antitrust laws of general applicability. However, pursuant to the United States Soft Drink Interbrand Competition Act, soft drink bottlers, such as us, are permitted to have exclusive rights to manufacture, distribute and sell soft drink products in a defined geographic territory if that soft drink product is in substantial and effective competition with other products of the same general class in the market. We believe such competition exists in each of the exclusive geographic territories in the United States in which we operate.
In response to growing health, nutrition and wellness concerns for today’s youth, a number of states and local governments have regulations restricting the sale of soft drinks and other foods in schools, particularly elementary, middle and high schools. Many of these restrictions have existed for several years in connection with subsidized meal programs in schools. Restrictive legislation, if widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on our products, sales and reputation.
Most beverage products sold by the Company are classified as food or food products and are therefore eligible for purchase using supplemental nutrition assistance program (“SNAP”) benefits by consumers purchasing them for home consumption. Energy drinks with a nutrition facts label are also classified as food and are eligible for purchase for home consumption using SNAP benefits, whereas energy drinks classified as a supplement by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) are not. Regulators may restrict the use of benefit programs, including SNAP, to purchase certain beverages and foods currently classified as food or food products.
Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have imposed, or are considering imposing, taxes, labeling requirements or other limitations on, or regulations pertaining to, the sale of certain of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the manufacture of our products, including certain of our products that contain added sugars or sodium, exceed a specified caloric count or include specified ingredients such as caffeine.
Legislation has been proposed in Congress and by certain state and local governments which would prohibit the sale of soft drink products in non-refillable bottles and cans or require a mandatory deposit as a means of encouraging the return of such containers, each in an attempt to reduce solid waste and litter. Similarly, we are aware of proposed legislation that would impose fees or taxes on various types of containers that are used in our business. We are not currently impacted by the policies in these types of proposed legislation, but it is possible that similar or more restrictive legal requirements may be proposed or enacted within our distribution territories in the future.
We are also subject to federal and local environmental laws, including laws related to water consumption and treatment, wastewater discharge and air emissions. Our facilities must comply with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding handling, storage, release and disposal of wastes generated on-site and sent to third-party owned and operated off-site licensed facilities.
We do not currently have any material commitments for environmental compliance or environmental remediation for any of our properties. We do not believe compliance with enacted or adopted federal, state and local provisions pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements or our competitive position.
Human Capital Resources
At Coca-Cola Consolidated, our teammates are the heart of our business and the key to our success. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 16,000 employees which we refer to as “teammates,” of which approximately 14,100 were full-time and 1,900 were part-time. Approximately 13% of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements. While the number of collective bargaining agreements that will expire in any given year varies, we have been successful in the past in negotiating renewals to expiring agreements without any material disruption to our operations, and management considers teammate relations to be good.
Purpose and Culture
We believe a strong and clear purpose is the foundation to a strong culture and critical to the long-term success of the business. At Coca‑Cola Consolidated, we strive to fulfill our Purpose – To honor God in all we do, to serve others, to pursue excellence and to grow profitably. And as a waypoint to help guide us along this journey is our Operating Destination – One Coca‑Cola Consolidated Team, consistently generating strong cash flow, while empowering the next generation of diverse servant leaders. At the core of our culture is a focus on service. We want teammates to recognize and embrace a passion for serving each other along with our consumers, our customers and our communities. Through our Coke Cares program, we provide opportunities for our teammates to be involved in stewardship, charitable and community activities as a way to serve our communities.
We recognize the personal challenges and difficulties facing our teammates each day, and how it may be difficult for them to discuss their struggles with other teammates. Through our corporate chaplaincy program and our employee assistance program, we provide resources for our teammates to engage with a third party in a personal and confidential manner to discuss their personal challenges. These programs are administered by third parties and are valuable resources to help enhance emotional wellness, reduce stress and increase productivity.
Talent Acquisition, Development and Retention
The success and growth of our business depend in a large part on our ability to execute on our talent strategy which is to be a purpose driven company that attracts, engages and grows a highly talented, diverse workforce of servant leaders enabling our growth and performance. To meet our talent objectives, we utilize key strategies and processes related to recruitment, onboarding and learning development. Through our Total Rewards Program, we strive to offer competitive compensation, benefits and services to our full-time teammates, including incentive plans, recognition plans, defined contribution plans, healthcare benefits, tax-advantaged spending accounts, corporate chaplaincy and employee assistance programs and other programs. Management monitors market compensation and benefits to be able to attract, retain and promote teammates and reduce turnover and its associated costs.
During 2021, the Company faced substantial turnover of teammates, periodic labor shortages and wage inflation in our front-line positions due to tight conditions in the nationwide labor market. The Company responded to these challenges by making investments to attract, reward and retain front-line employees, as well as increasing base pay for front-line workers in certain competitive markets.
We are a learning organization committed to the goal of continuous improvement and the development of our teams and teammates. To empower our teammates to unlock their potential, we offer a wide range of learning experiences and resources. Our teammate onboarding experiences involve online learning, job-specific training and on-the-job development to learn about our Company, our products and our industry. Job-specific training includes activity-based classes that focus on how teammates can safely and efficiently 
sell, merchandise and display our products. After onboarding, our teammates may participate in numerous learning experiences offered by the Company to help them develop and improve their skills and capabilities to advance in their careers, including at one of our two dedicated experiential learning centers where teammates can develop and grow their skills through a hands-on experience. We provide a leadership program designed to challenge and grow our future servant leaders through a series of learning experiences, including on-the-job training, mentorship, peer coaching and formal leadership courses. This program focuses on developing leadership skills, building cohesive teams and strengthening business acumen to prepare teammates for a leadership position at Coca‑Cola Consolidated.
An important part of attracting and retaining top talent is teammate satisfaction, and we conduct an annual engagement survey administered and analyzed by an independent third party to assess teammate satisfaction and engagement and the effectiveness of our teammate development and compensation programs. In 2021, 74% of our teammates participated in the survey. This survey provides valuable insight to our leaders about how our teammates experience the Company and how we can better serve them and improve job performance, satisfaction and retention. Our executive officers review the survey results and develop and implement specific action plans to address key areas of opportunity. Additionally, leaders across our Company discuss the results with local managers to develop additional action plans to best address teammate feedback in different market units and functional areas.
Health and Safety
One of our top priorities is protecting the health and safety of our teammates. We are committed to operating in a safe, secure and responsible manner for the benefit of our consumers, customers, teammates and communities. We sponsor a number of programs and initiatives designed to reduce the frequency and severity of workplace injuries, incidents, risks and hazards, including safety committees, Company policies and procedures, coaching and training, and awareness through leadership engagement and messaging.
We continue to diligently monitor and manage through the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including by taking actions to protect and promote the health and safety of our consumers, customers, teammates and communities while continuing to manufacture and distribute products. For more information about the Company’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see the “COVID-19 Impact on Consumer, Customer, Teammate and Community Safety” section of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Diversity and Inclusion
We strive to cultivate diversity in our workforce and believe teammates with diverse backgrounds, experiences and viewpoints bring value to our organization. We have a diversity task force comprised of diverse teammates from across the organization and led by our President and Chief Operating Officer with a focus on cultivating diversity at Coca‑Cola Consolidated. This task force developed a diversity framework focused on four pillars – communication, accountability, empowerment and partnerships. The task force and discussion groups led by our senior executive leadership team strive to enhance Company-wide engagement on diversity and inclusion, provide opportunities for teammates to discuss diversity and inclusion, develop initiatives to support our diversity framework and monitor progress across these initiatives.
