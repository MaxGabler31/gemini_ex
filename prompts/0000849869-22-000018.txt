ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
GENERAL
We are a leading manufacturer of sustainable rigid packaging solutions for consumer goods products. We had consolidated net sales of approximately $5.7 billion in 2021. Our products are used for a wide variety of end markets and we operate 113 manufacturing plants in North America, Europe, Asia and South America. Our products include:

We are a leading worldwide manufacturer of dispensing and specialty closures for food, beverage, health care, garden, home, personal care, fragrance and beauty products. Our leadership position in dispensing and specialty closures is a result of our ability to provide customers with high levels of quality, service and technological support. Our dispensing and specialty closures business provides customers with an extensive variety of innovative dispensing systems and proprietary specialty closures solutions that ensure closure quality and safety, as well as state-of-the-art capping/sealing equipment and detection systems to complement our product offering. We have 46 dispensing and specialty closure manufacturing facilities located in North America, Europe, Asia and South America, from which we serve over 100 countries throughout the world. In addition, we license our technology to four other manufacturers for various international markets that we do not serve directly. For 2021, our dispensing and specialty closures business had net sales of $2.16 billion (approximately 38.0 percent of our consolidated net sales) and segment income of $262.1 million (approximately 43.1 percent of our consolidated income before interest and income taxes excluding corporate expense).
We are also a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe, and in North America we are the largest manufacturer of metal food containers with a unit volume market share in the United States in 2021 of slightly more than half of the market. Our leadership in these markets is driven by our high levels of quality, service and technological support, our low cost producer position, our strong long-term customer relationships and our proximity to customers through our widespread geographic presence. We have 44 metal container manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Europe and Asia, serving over 50 countries throughout the world. Additionally, we believe that we have the most comprehensive equipment capabilities in the industry. For 2021, our metal containers business had net sales of $2.81 billion (approximately 49.5 percent of our consolidated net sales) and segment income of $253.7 million (approximately 41.7 percent of our consolidated income before interest and income taxes excluding corporate expense).
Additionally, we are a leading manufacturer of custom containers in North America for a variety of markets, including the personal care, food, health care and household and industrial chemical markets. Our success with custom containers is largely due to our demonstrated ability to provide our customers with high levels of quality, service and technological support, along with our value-added design-focused products and our extensive geographic presence with 23 manufacturing facilities in the United States and Canada. We produce custom containers from a full range of resin materials and offer a comprehensive array of molding and decorating capabilities. For 2021, our custom containers business had net sales of $708.6 million (approximately 12.5 percent of our consolidated net sales) and segment income of $92.4 million (approximately 15.2 percent of our consolidated income before interest and income taxes excluding corporate expense).
Our customer base includes some of the world’s best-known branded consumer products companies. Our philosophy has been to develop long-term customer relationships by acting in partnership with our customers by providing reliable quality, service and technological support and utilizing our low cost producer position. The strength of our customer relationships is evidenced by our large number of multi-year supply arrangements, our high retention of customers’ business and our continued recognition from customers, as demonstrated by the many quality and service awards we have received. We estimate that in 2022 approximately 90 percent of our projected metal container sales and a majority of our projected dispensing and specialty closures and custom container sales will be under multi-year customer supply arrangements.
Our objective is to increase shareholder value by efficiently deploying capital and management resources to grow our business, reduce operating costs and build sustainable competitive positions, or franchises, and to complete acquisitions that generate attractive cash returns. We believe that we will accomplish this goal because of our leading market positions and management expertise in acquiring, financing, integrating and efficiently operating consumer goods packaging businesses.
OUR HISTORY
We are a Delaware corporation. We were founded in 1987 by R. Philip Silver and D. Greg Horrigan, two of the members of our Board of Directors. Since our inception, we have acquired forty businesses. Through acquisitions and organic growth, we have become a leading worldwide manufacturer of dispensing and specialty closures for food, beverage, health care, garden, home, personal care, fragrance and beauty products, with net sales of $2.16 billion in 2021, representing a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 13.9 percent since our acquisition of the White Cap closures operations in the United States in 2003. As a result of the benefits of acquisitions and organic growth, we have become a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe, with net sales of $2.81 billion in 2021, representing a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 7.3 percent since 1987, and have increased our overall share of the metal food container market in the United States from approximately ten percent in 1987 to slightly more than half of the market in 2021. We have also grown our market position in the custom container business since 1987, with net sales increasing to $708.6 million in 2021, representing a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 6.3 percent over that period.

On October 1, 2021, we acquired Easytech Closures S.p.A., or Easytech, a manufacturer of easy-open and sanitary metal ends used with metal containers primarily for food applications in Europe.
OUR STRATEGY
We intend to enhance our position as a leading manufacturer of consumer goods packaging products by continuing to aggressively pursue a strategy designed to achieve future growth and increase shareholder value by focusing on the following key elements:
SUPPLY “BEST VALUE” PACKAGING PRODUCTS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF QUALITY, SERVICE AND TECHNOLOGICAL SUPPORT
Since our inception, we have been, and intend to continue to be, devoted to consistently supplying our sustainable rigid packaging products with the combination of quality, price and service that our customers consider to be “best value.” In our dispensing and specialty closures business, we emphasize high levels of quality, service and technological support. We believe our dispensing and specialty closures business is the premier innovative dispensing and specialty closures solutions provider to the food, beverage, health care, garden, home, personal care, fragrance and beauty industries. We manufacture throughout the world a wide range of highly engineered dispensing systems for health care, garden, home, personal care, fragrance, beauty and food products. We also offer customers an extensive variety of metal and plastic specialty closures for food and beverage products, as well as proprietary equipment solutions such as cap feeders, cappers and detection systems, to ensure high quality package safety. In our metal containers business, we focus on providing high quality and high levels of service and utilizing our low cost producer position to supply our customers with metal containers, which are infinitely recyclable and one of the most recycled packages in the world. We have made and are continuing to make significant capital investments to enhance the competitive advantages of metal containers and to offer our customers value-added features such as our family of Quick Top® easy-open ends for our metal food containers, shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers. In our custom containers business, we provide high levels of quality and service and focus on value-added, custom designed containers to meet changing product and packaging demands of our customers. We believe that we are one of the few businesses that can custom design, manufacture and decorate a wide variety of custom containers, providing the customer with the ability to satisfy more of its packaging needs for custom containers through one supplier. We will continue to supply customized products that can be delivered quickly to our customers with superior levels of design, development and technological support. We also have made and continue to make strategic investments to enhance the competitive position of our custom containers business.
MAINTAIN LOW COST PRODUCER POSITION
We will continue pursuing opportunities to strengthen our low cost position in our businesses by:
•maintaining a flat, efficient organizational structure, resulting in low selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales;
•achieving and maintaining economies of scale;
•prudently investing in new technologies to increase manufacturing and production efficiency;
•rationalizing our existing plant structure; and
•serving our customers from our strategically located plants.
Through our dispensing and specialty closures facilities, we manufacture an extensive variety of highly engineered dispensing systems and metal and plastic specialty closures for the food, beverage, health care, garden, home, personal care, fragrance and beauty industries throughout the world utilizing state-of-the-art technology and equipment, and we also provide customers for our specialty closures with state-of-the-art capping/sealing equipment and detection systems. Through our metal container facilities, we believe that we provide the most comprehensive manufacturing capabilities in the industry. Through our custom container facilities, we have the capacity to manufacture customized products across the entire spectrum of resin materials, decorating techniques and molding processes required by our customers. We intend to leverage our manufacturing, design and engineering capabilities to continue to create cost-effective manufacturing systems that will drive our improvements in product quality, operating efficiency and customer support.
In 2019, we initiated a multi-year footprint optimization plan in our metal containers business in the United States to reduce capacity and continue to drive cost reductions, under which we shut down two metal container manufacturing facilities in the fourth quarter of 2019. We delayed further implementation of this footprint optimization plan in 2020 and 2021 due to a strong increase in demand for our products and may make changes to this footprint optimization plan based on further demand changes for our products.
MAINTAIN AN OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT GROWTH AND INCREASE SHAREHOLDER VALUE
Our financial strategy is to use reasonable leverage to support our growth and increase shareholder returns. Our stable and predictable cash flow, generated largely as a result of our long-term customer relationships and generally recession resistant business, supports our financial strategy. We intend to continue using reasonable leverage, supported by our stable cash flows, to make value enhancing acquisitions. In determining reasonable leverage, we evaluate our cost of capital and manage our level of debt to maintain an optimal cost of capital based on current market conditions. If acquisition opportunities are not identified over a long period of time, we may use our cash flow to repay debt, repurchase shares of our common stock or increase dividends to our stockholders or for other permitted purposes. In August 2019, we redeemed all $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 5½% Senior Notes due 2022, or the 5½% Notes, with revolving loan borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, as amended, or our Credit Agreement, and cash on hand. In November 2019, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4⅛% Senior Notes due 2028, or the 4⅛% Notes, and used the net proceeds therefrom to repay outstanding revolving loans under our Credit Agreement at that time, including revolving loans used to redeem the 5½% Notes. In February 2020, we issued an additional $200.0 million of the 4⅛% Notes and €500.0 million of our 2¼% Senior Notes due 2028, or the 2¼% Notes. We used the net proceeds of these issuances and revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement to prepay all of our outstanding U.S. dollar term loans under our Credit Agreement at that time. In June 2020, we funded the purchase price for the dispensing operations of the Albéa Group, or the Albéa Dispensing Business, with $900.0 million of incremental term loans under our Credit Agreement. In February 2021, we amended our Credit Agreement to provide us with additional flexibility to, among other things, issue new senior secured notes, and we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.4% Senior Secured Notes due 2026, or the 1.4% Notes, and used the proceeds therefrom to prepay $500.0 million of our outstanding term loans under our Credit Agreement. In September and October 2021, we funded the purchase price for each of Silgan Specialty Packaging, Unicep and Easytech with revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement.  In November 2021, we further amended our Credit Agreement to extend maturity dates by more than three years, increase our revolving loan facility from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion, borrow $1.0 billion in new term loans to refinance outstanding term and revolving loans under our Credit Agreement that were used to fund the three recent acquisitions completed in 2021 and the acquisition of the Albéa Dispensing Business in 2020, and provide us with additional flexibility with regard to our strategic initiatives. You should also read Notes 3, 9 and 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
EXPAND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS AND INTERNAL GROWTH
We intend to continue to increase our market share in our current markets and related markets through acquisitions and internal growth. We use a disciplined approach to make acquisitions and investments that generate attractive cash returns. As a result, we expect to continue to expand and diversify our customer base, geographic presence and product lines. This strategy has enabled us to increase our net sales and income before interest and income taxes since our founding. 
With our acquisitions of our dispensing and specialty closures operations in North America, Europe, Asia and South America as well as organic growth, we established ourselves as a leading worldwide manufacturer of dispensing systems and specialty closures for food, beverage, health care, garden, home, personal care, fragrance and beauty products. In 2017, we broadened our closures portfolio to include dispensing systems with our acquisition of the dispensing systems operations of WestRock Company, now operating under the name Silgan Dispensing Systems, or SDS, and we further expanded our dispensing systems operations with our acquisitions of the Albéa Dispensing Business in 2020 and Silgan Specialty Packaging and Unicep in 2021. Since 2003, following our acquisition of the White Cap closures operations in the United States, net sales of our dispensing and specialty closures business have increased to $2.16 billion in 2021 as a result of acquisitions and internal growth, representing a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 13.9 percent over that period. We may pursue further consolidation opportunities in the dispensing and specialty closures markets, including in dispensing systems, or in adjacent markets, such as our acquisitions of Silgan Specialty Packaging and Unicep. Additionally, we expect to continue to generate internal growth in our dispensing and specialty closures business, particularly in dispensing systems. In making investments to pursue internal growth, we use a disciplined approach to generate attractive cash returns.
We are a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe, primarily as a result of our acquisitions but also as a result of growth with existing customers. During the past 35 years, the metal food container market in North America has experienced significant consolidation primarily due to the desire by food processors to reduce costs and focus resources on their core operations rather than self-manufacture their metal 
food containers. Our acquisitions of the metal food container manufacturing operations of Nestlé Food Company, or Nestlé, The Dial Corporation, or Dial, Del Monte Corporation, or Del Monte, Birds Eye Foods, Inc., or Birds Eye, Campbell Soup Company, or Campbell, Pacific Coast Producers, or Pacific Coast, and Nestlé Purina PetCare's steel container self-manufacturing assets, or Purina Steel Can, reflect this trend. We estimate that approximately nine percent of the market for metal food containers in the United States is still served by self-manufacturers.
We have expanded our metal containers business and increased our market share of metal containers primarily through acquisitions and growth with existing customers with net sales increasing to $2.81 billion in 2021, representing a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 7.3 percent since 1987. We have also made, and are continuing to make, significant capital investments in our metal containers business to enhance our business and the competitive advantages of metal packaging for food and to offer our customers value-added features, such as our family of Quick Top® easy-open ends for metal food containers, shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers. In 2021, approximately 70 percent of our metal food containers sold had an easy-open end. 
We have grown our market position for our custom containers business since 1987, with net sales increasing to $708.6 million in 2021, representing a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 6.3 percent over that period. We achieved this improvement primarily through strategic acquisitions as well as through internal growth. The custom containers segment of the consumer goods packaging industry continues to be highly fragmented, and we intend to pursue further consolidation opportunities in this market. We also expect to continue to generate internal growth in our custom containers business. As with acquisitions, we use a disciplined approach to pursue internal growth to generate attractive cash returns. Through a combination of these efforts, we intend to continue to expand our customer base in the markets that we serve, such as the personal care, food, health care, pharmaceutical, household and industrial chemical, pet food and care, agricultural, automotive and marine chemical markets.
ENHANCE PROFITABILITY THROUGH PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS AND COST REDUCTIONS
We intend to continue to enhance profitability through investment of capital for productivity improvements, manufacturing efficiencies, manufacturing cost reductions, and the optimization of our manufacturing facilities footprints. The additional sales and production capacity provided through acquisitions and investments have enabled us to rationalize plant operations and decrease overhead costs through plant closings and downsizings. From 2016, we have closed two dispensing and specialty closures manufacturing facilities, six metal containers manufacturing facilities and two custom containers manufacturing facilities in connection with our continuing efforts to streamline our plant operations, reduce operating costs and better match supply with geographic demand. 
We expect that most future acquisitions will continue to enable us to realize manufacturing efficiencies as a result of optimizing production scheduling and other benefits from economies of scale and the elimination of redundant selling and administrative functions. In addition to the benefits realized through the integration of acquired businesses, we have improved and expect to continue to improve the operating performance of our plant facilities by investing capital for productivity improvements, manufacturing efficiencies and manufacturing cost reductions. While we have made some of these investments in certain of our plants, more opportunities still exist throughout our system. We will continue to use a disciplined approach to identify these opportunities to generate attractive cash returns.
In 2019, we initiated a multi-year footprint optimization plan in our metal containers business in the United States to reduce capacity and continue to drive cost reductions, under which we shut down two metal container manufacturing facilities in the fourth quarter of 2019. We delayed further implementation of this footprint optimization plan in 2020 and 2021 due to a strong increase in demand for our products and may make changes to this footprint optimization plan based on further demand changes for our products.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
We are a holding company that conducts our business through various operating subsidiaries. We operate three businesses: our dispensing and specialty closures business; our metal containers business; and our custom containers business.
DISPENSING AND SPECIALTY CLOSURES—38.0 PERCENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES IN 2021
We are a leading worldwide manufacturer of dispensing and specialty closures for food, beverage, health care, garden, home, personal care, fragrance and beauty products. Our dispensing and specialty closures business provides customers with an extensive variety of innovative dispensing system solutions, including integrated dispensing packaging solutions, and proprietary metal and plastic specialty closures that ensure closure quality and safety, as well as state-of-the-art capping/sealing equipment and detection systems to complement our specialty closures product offering. We have 46 dispensing and specialty closures manufacturing facilities located in North America, Europe, Asia and South America, from which we serve over 100 countries throughout the world. In addition, we license our technology to four other manufacturers for various markets that we do not serve directly. For 2021, our dispensing and specialty closures business had net sales of $2.16 billion (approximately 38.0 percent of our consolidated net sales) and segment income of $262.1 million (approximately 43.1 percent of our consolidated income before interest and income taxes excluding corporate expense). Since 2003, following our acquisition of the White Cap closures operations in the United States, we have grown our dispensing and specialty closures business through acquisitions and organic growth, with net sales increasing at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 13.9 percent.
 With our acquisition in 2017 of SDS, we broadened our closures portfolio to include dispensing systems for health care, garden, home, personal care, fragrance, beauty and food products, such as health care nasal spray and topical applications, lawn and garden products, hard surface cleaning products, professional cleaning products, air and fabric care products, perfume and other fragrance products, skin care products, lotions, cosmetics, soaps, hair care products and other bath and body products and condiments. With our acquisition in 2020 of the Albéa Dispensing Business, we expanded our dispensing systems portfolio, including for highly engineered pumps, sprayers and foam dispensing solutions for the beauty, fragrance and personal care markets. With our acquisition in 2021 of Silgan Specialty Packaging, we further grew our dispensing systems portfolio with integrated dispensing packaging solutions offerings. Our acquisition in 2021 of Unicep complemented our global dispensing and specialty closures business by expanding and extending our precision dosing capabilities and comprehensive product offering into new and existing markets and broadened our exposure to health care and Point-of-Care diagnostics markets. We also manufacture metal and plastic specialty closures, many of which maintain a vacuum, for food and beverage products, such as ready-to-drink teas, sports drinks, dairy products, tomato sauce, salsa, pickles, baby food, juice drinks, ketchup, preserves, soup, cooking sauces, gravies, fruits, vegetables and infant formula products. We provide customers for our specialty closures with custom formulations of sealing/lining materials, designed either to minimize removal torques and enhance openability of our closures or to maintain sealability of our closures, in each case to meet the unique needs of our customers while also meeting applicable regulatory requirements. We offer our customers an extensive range of decorating options for our dispensing and specialty closures for product differentiation. We also provide customers with sealing/capping equipment and detection systems to complement our specialty closures product offering. As a result of our extensive range of dispensing and specialty closures, our geographic presence and our focus on providing high levels of quality, service and technological support, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to serve food, beverage, health care, garden, home, personal care, fragrance and beauty product companies for all of their dispensing and specialty closure needs. 
METAL CONTAINERS—49.5 PERCENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES IN 2021
We are a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe, and in North America we are the largest manufacturer of metal food containers with a unit volume market share in the United States in 2021 of slightly more than half of the market. Our metal containers business is engaged in the manufacture and sale of steel and aluminum containers that are used primarily by processors and packagers for food products, such as pet food, vegetables, soup, proteins (e.g., meat, chicken and seafood), tomato based products, adult nutritional drinks, fruit and other miscellaneous food products, as well as general line metal containers primarily for chemicals. With our acquisition in 2021 of Easytech, we increased our manufacturing capacity for easy-open ends for metal containers. We have 44 metal container manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Europe and Asia, serving over 50 countries throughout the world. For 2021, our metal containers business had net sales of $2.81 billion (approximately 49.5 percent of our consolidated net sales) and segment income of $253.7 million (approximately 41.7 percent of our consolidated income before interest and income taxes excluding corporate expense). Since 
1987, we have grown our metal containers business through acquisitions and organic growth, with net sales increasing at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 7.3 percent. We estimate that approximately 90 percent of our projected metal container sales in 2022 will be pursuant to multi-year customer supply arrangements.
Although metal containers face competition from plastic, paper, glass and composite containers, we believe metal containers are superior to plastic, paper and composite containers in applications where the contents are prepared at high temperatures, or packaged in larger consumer or institutional quantities, or where the long-term storage of the product is desirable while maintaining the product’s quality. We also believe that metal containers are generally more desirable than glass containers because metal containers are more durable and less costly to transport. In addition, metal containers are one of the most recycled packages in the world and are infinitely recyclable. We have increased our market share of metal food containers in the United States primarily through acquisitions and growth with existing customers, and have enhanced our business by focusing on providing customers with high quality, high levels of service and value-added features such as our family of Quick Top® easy-open ends, shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers. In addition, we have made and continue to make significant capital investments to enhance the competitive advantages of metal containers for food.
CUSTOM CONTAINERS—12.5 PERCENT OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES IN 2021
We produce custom containers from a full range of resin materials and offer a comprehensive array of molding and decorating capabilities. We are one of the leading manufacturers of custom designed high density polyethylene, or HDPE, and polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, containers in North America for the markets that we serve. We are also a leading manufacturer in North America of thermoformed barrier and non-barrier bowls and trays for shelf-stable food products. We operate 23 custom container manufacturing facilities in the United States and Canada. For 2021, our custom containers business had net sales of $708.6 million (approximately 12.5 percent of our consolidated net sales) and segment income of $92.4 million (approximately 15.2 percent of our consolidated income before interest and income taxes excluding corporate expense). Since 1987, we have improved our market position for our custom containers business, with net sales increasing at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 6.3 percent.
We manufacture custom designed and stock plastic containers for personal care and health care products, including containers for mouthwash, shampoos, conditioners, hand creams, lotions, liquid soap, respiratory and gastrointestinal products, cosmetics and toiletries; food and beverage products, including peanut butter, salad dressings, condiments, dairy products and liquor; household and industrial chemical products, including containers for lawn, garden and agricultural products, scouring cleaners and cleaning agents; and pharmaceutical products, including containers for tablets and antacids. In addition, we manufacture thermoformed barrier and non-barrier bowls and trays for food products, such as soups and other ready-to-eat meals and pet food, as well as thermoformed tubs for food, household and personal care products, including soft fabric wipes. We also manufacture plastic closures, caps, sifters and fitments for food and household products, including salad dressings, condiments, peanut butter, spices, liquid margarine, powdered drink mixes and arts and crafts supplies. 
Our leading position in the custom container market is largely driven by our rapid response to our customers’ design, development and technology support needs and our value-added, diverse product line. This product line is the result of our ability to produce custom containers from a full range of resin materials using a broad array of manufacturing, molding and decorating capabilities. We also strive to remain current with and, to some extent, anticipate innovations in resin composition and applications and changes in the technology for the manufacturing of custom containers. We benefit from our large scale and nationwide presence, as significant consolidation is occurring in many of our customers’ markets. Through these capabilities, we are well-positioned to serve our customers, who demand customized solutions as they continue to seek innovative means to differentiate their products in the marketplace using packaging. 
MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCTION
As is the practice in the industry, most of our customers provide us with periodic estimates of products and quantities pursuant to which commitments are given. These estimates enable us to effectively manage production and control working capital requirements. We schedule our production to meet customers’ requirements. Because the production time for our products is short, the backlog of customer orders in relation to our sales is not material.
As of February 1, 2022, we operated a total of 113 manufacturing facilities in 21 different countries throughout the world that serve the needs of our customers.
DISPENSING AND SPECIALTY CLOSURES BUSINESS
We utilize two basic processes to produce dispensing systems and plastic closures. In the compression molded process, pellets of resin are heated, extruded and then compressed to form a shell. The shell can include a molded linerless seal or a custom formulated, compression molded sealing system. The shell can then be slit and printed depending on its end use. In the injection molded process, pellets of resin are heated and injected into a mold, forming either a shell or other dispensing systems component, such as a trigger, decorative shroud, actuator, valve or overcap. The shell can include a molded linerless seal or a custom formulated sealing system. The shell can then be slit and printed depending on its end use. In the case of a dispensing system, the dispensing system components are assembled into the dispensing system and can be printed depending on the end use of the dispensing system. 
The manufacturing operations for metal closures include cutting, coating, lithographing, fabricating and lining. We manufacture twist-off, lug style and press-on, twist-off steel closures and aluminum roll-on closures for glass, metal and plastic containers, ranging in size from 18 to 110 millimeters in diameter. We employ state-of-the-art multi-die presses to manufacture metal closures, offering a low-cost, high quality means of production. We also provide customers of our dispensing and specialty closures business with custom formulations of sealing/lining materials, designed to minimize torque removal and enhance the openability of our closures while meeting applicable regulatory requirements.
METAL CONTAINERS BUSINESS
The manufacturing operations of our metal containers business include cutting, coating, lithographing, fabricating, assembling and packaging finished cans. We use three basic processes to produce cans. The traditional three-piece method requires three pieces of flat metal to form a cylindrical body with a welded side seam, a bottom and a top. High integrity of the side seam is assured by the use of sophisticated electronic weld monitors and coatings that are thermally cured by induction and convection processes. The other two methods of producing cans start by forming a shallow cup that is then formed into the desired height using either the draw and iron process or the draw and redraw process. Using the draw and redraw process, we manufacture steel and aluminum two-piece cans, the height of which generally does not exceed the diameter. For cans the height of which is greater than the diameter, we manufacture steel two-piece cans by using a drawing and ironing process. We manufacture can bodies and ends from thin, high-strength aluminum alloys and steels by utilizing proprietary tool and die designs and selected can making equipment. We also manufacture our Quick Top® easy-open ends from both steel and aluminum alloys in a sophisticated precision progressive die process. We regularly review our Quick Top® easy-open end designs for improvements for optimum consumer preference through consumer studies and feedback.
CUSTOM CONTAINERS BUSINESS
We utilize two basic processes to produce custom containers. In the extrusion blowmolding process, pellets of resin are heated and extruded into a tube. A two-piece metal mold is then closed around the tube and high pressure air is blown into it causing a bottle to form in the mold’s shape. In the injection and injection stretch blowmolding processes, pellets of resin are heated and injected into a mold, forming a preform. The preform is then blown into a bottle-shaped metal mold, creating a bottle.
Our thermoformed bowls, trays and tubs are manufactured by melting pellets of resin into an extruded sheet. The sheet is then formed in a mold to make the bowl, tray or tub.
We have state-of-the-art decorating equipment, including several of the largest sophisticated decorating facilities in the United States. Our decorating methods for custom containers are in-mold labeling, which applies a plastic film label to the bottle during the blowing process, and post-mold decoration. Post-mold decoration includes:
•silk screen decoration which enables the applications of images in multiple colors to the bottle;
•pressure sensitive decoration which uses a plastic film or paper label with an adhesive;
•heat transfer decoration which uses a coated label applied by heat; and
•shrink sleeve labeling.
RAW MATERIALS
Based upon our existing arrangements with suppliers and our current and anticipated requirements, we believe that we have made adequate provisions for acquiring our raw materials for the foreseeable future. As a result of significant consolidation of suppliers, we are, however, dependent upon a limited number of suppliers for our steel, aluminum, coatings and compound raw materials. Increases in the prices of raw materials have generally been passed along to our customers in accordance with our multi-year customer supply arrangements and through general price increases.
DISPENSING AND SPECIALTY CLOSURES BUSINESS
 We use resins in pellet form, such as homopolymer polypropylene, copolymer polypropylene and HDPE, thermoplastic elastomer lining materials, processing additives and colorants in the manufacture of dispensing systems and plastic closures. We use tinplated and chromium plated steel, aluminum, organic coatings, low-metallic inks and pulpboard, plastic and organic lining materials in the manufacture of metal closures. Although no assurances can be given, we believe we have made adequate provisions to purchase sufficient quantities of these raw materials to meet our customers' requirements for the foreseeable future, despite the significant consolidation of suppliers and absent unforeseen events such as hurricanes or other extreme weather conditions.
Our supply agreements with our dispensing systems and specialty closures customers generally provide for the pass through of changes in our metal and resin costs, subject in many cases with respect to resin to a lag in the timing of such pass through. For our dispensing systems and specialty closures customers without long-term agreements, we have also generally increased prices to pass through increases in our metal and resin costs. 
METAL CONTAINERS BUSINESS
We use tinplated and chromium plated steel, aluminum, copper wire, organic coatings, lining compound and inks in the manufacture and decoration of our metal container products. Our material requirements are supplied through agreements and purchase orders with suppliers with whom we have long-term relationships. If our suppliers fail to deliver under their arrangements, we would be forced to purchase raw materials on the open market, and no assurances can be given that we would be able to purchase such raw materials or, if we are so able, that we would be able to purchase such raw materials at comparable prices or terms. Although there has been significant consolidation of suppliers, we believe that we have made adequate provisions to purchase sufficient quantities of these raw materials to meet our customers' requirements for the foreseeable future.
Our metal container supply agreements with our customers provide for the pass through of changes in our metal costs. For our metal container customers without long-term agreements, we have also generally increased prices to pass through increases in our metal costs. 
CUSTOM CONTAINERS BUSINESS
The raw materials we use in our custom containers business are primarily resins in pellet form such as virgin HDPE, virgin PET, recycled HDPE, recycled PET, polypropylene and, to a lesser extent, low density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate glycol and medium density polyethylene. Our resin requirements are acquired through multi-year arrangements for specific quantities of resins with several major suppliers of resins. The price that we pay for resin raw materials is not fixed and is subject to market pricing, which has fluctuated significantly in the past few years. Our custom container supply agreements with our customers provide for the pass through of changes in our resin costs, subject in many cases to a short lag in the timing of such pass through. For our custom container customers without long-term agreements, we have also generally increased prices to pass through increases in our resin costs.
We believe that we have made adequate provisions to purchase sufficient quantities of resins to meet our customers' requirements for the foreseeable future, absent unforeseen events such as significant hurricanes or other extreme weather conditions.
SALES AND MARKETING
Our philosophy has been to develop long-term customer relationships by acting in partnership with our customers, providing reliable quality and service. We market our products primarily by a direct sales force, including manufacturer's representatives, and for our custom containers business, in part, through a network of distributors. Because of the high cost of transporting empty containers, our metal containers business generally sells to customers within a 300 mile radius of its manufacturing plants.
Approximately 12 percent, 11 percent and 12 percent of our consolidated net sales were to Nestlé in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our total consolidated net sales during those years.

Outside of the United States, the dispensing and specialty closures business has had long-term relationships with most of its customers. While we have multi-year supply arrangements with some of our dispensing and specialty closures customers outside of the United States, as is common practice, many supply arrangements with customers outside of the United States are negotiated on a year-by-year basis.
In addition, we license our technology to four other manufacturers who supply products in Israel, South Korea, Maldives, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
METAL CONTAINERS BUSINESS
We are a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe, and in North America we are the largest manufacturer of metal food containers with a unit volume market share in the United States in 2021 of more than half of the market. We have 44 metal containers manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Europe and Asia, serving over 50 countries throughout the world. Our largest customers for these products include B&G Foods, Inc., Bonduelle Group, Campbell, Conagra Brands, Inc., Del Monte, General Mills, Inc., Hill's Pet Nutrition, Inc., Hormel Foods Corporation, Kraft Heinz, Mars, Incorporated, Nestlé, Pacific Coast, Stanislaus Food Products Company, Thai Union Group and Tony Downs Foods Co. 
We have entered into multi-year supply arrangements with most of our customers for our metal containers business. We estimate that approximately 90 percent of our projected metal container sales in 2022 will be pursuant to multi-year customer supply arrangements. Historically, we have been successful in continuing these multi-year customer supply arrangements. In Europe, our metal containers business has had long-term relationships with many of its customers, although, as is common practice, many supply arrangements are negotiated on a year-by-year basis.
Since our inception in 1987, we have supplied Nestlé with substantially all of its U.S. metal food container requirements. Our net sales of metal food containers to Nestlé in North America and Europe in 2021 were $609.0 million. We also supply Nestlé with closures in North America and Europe and plastic containers in North America. In 2018, we entered into long-term supply agreements with Nestlé that run through 2025 for the supply of all of Nestlé’s North American metal food container requirements for pet food and other food products and to support growth initiatives of Nestlé. These long-term supply agreements replaced previous supply agreements with Nestlé. Each of these long-term supply agreements provide for certain prices and specify that those prices will be increased or decreased based upon price change formulas.
Our metal containers business’ sales and income from operations are dependent, in part, upon the vegetable and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the United States and, to a lesser extent, in a variety of national growing regions in Europe. The size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year, depending in large part upon the weather conditions in those regions. Because of the seasonality of the harvests, we have historically experienced higher unit sales volume in the third quarter of our fiscal year and generated a disproportionate amount of our annual income from operations during that quarter. You should also read “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Business, Operations and Certain Financial Matters—The seasonality of the fruit and vegetable packing industry causes us to incur short-term debt” included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
CUSTOM CONTAINERS BUSINESS
We are one of the leading manufacturers of custom designed and stock plastic containers sold in North America for a variety of markets, including the personal care, food, health care and household and industrial chemical markets. We are also a leading manufacturer in North America of thermoformed barrier and non-barrier bowls and trays for shelf-stable food products and pet food products. We market our custom containers in most areas of North America through a direct sales force and a large network of distributors. We also market certain stock plastic containers through an on-line shopping catalog.
Our largest customers for our custom containers business include Berlin Packaging LLC, Campbell, Conagra Brands, Inc., General Mills, Inc., Henkel AG & Co. KGaA, Johnson & Johnson, Kraft Heinz, Mars, Incorporated, McCormick & Company, Inc., Nice-Pak Products, Inc., Perrigo Company plc, The Procter & Gamble Company, The Scotts Company LLC, TreeHouse Foods Inc., TricorBraun, Inc. and Vi-Jon Laboratories, Inc.
We have arrangements to sell some of our custom containers to distributors, who in turn resell those products primarily to regional customers. Custom containers sold to distributors are generally manufactured by using generic and custom molds with decoration added to meet the end users’ requirements. The distributors’ warehouses and their sales personnel enable us to market and inventory a wide range of such products to a variety of customers.
We have multi-year supply arrangements with the majority of our customers for our custom containers business. In addition, many of our supply arrangements with our customers are for custom containers made from proprietary molds.
COMPETITION
The packaging industry is highly competitive. We compete in this industry with manufacturers of similar and other types of packaging, as well as fillers, food processors and packers who manufacture containers for their own use and for sale to others. We attempt to compete effectively through the quality of our products, competitive pricing and our ability to meet customer requirements for delivery, performance and technical assistance.
DISPENSING AND SPECIALTY CLOSURES BUSINESS
Our dispensing and specialty closures business competes primarily with AptarGroup, Inc., Bericap Holding GmbH, Berry Global Group, Inc., Closures Systems International, Inc., Crown Holdings, Inc., Eviosys (a portfolio company of KPS Capital Partners that owns the former EMEA metal packaging assets of Crown Holdings, Inc.), Guala Dispensing Mexico, S.A. de C.V., Massilly Holding SAS and Tecnocap S.p.A. With our ability to manufacture an extensive range of dispensing systems and specialty closures that ensure closure quality and safety, as well as state-of-the-art capping/sealing equipment and detection systems to complement our specialty closures product offering, and our geographic presence, we believe we are uniquely positioned to serve food, beverage, health care, garden, home, personal care, fragrance and beauty product companies for all of their dispensing and specialty closure needs.
METAL CONTAINERS BUSINESS
Of the commercial metal container manufacturers, Sonoco Products Company (which recently acquired Ball Metalpack, LLC), Crown Holdings, Inc., Eviosys (a portfolio company of KPS Capital Partners that owns the former EMEA metal packaging assets of Crown Holdings, Inc.) and Trivium Packaging are our most significant competitors. Our competitors also include other regional suppliers. As an alternative to purchasing containers from commercial can manufacturers, customers have the ability to invest in equipment to self-manufacture their containers.
Because of the high cost of transporting empty containers, our metal containers business generally sells to customers within a 300 mile radius of its manufacturing plants. Strategically located existing plants give us an 
advantage over competitors from other areas, but we could be potentially disadvantaged by the relocation of a major customer.
Although metal containers face competition from plastic, paper, glass and composite containers, we believe that metal containers are superior to plastic, composite and paper containers in applications, where the contents are prepared at high temperatures or packaged in larger consumer or institutional quantities or where long-term storage of the product is desirable while maintaining the product’s quality. We also believe that metal containers are more desirable generally than glass containers because metal containers are more durable and less costly to transport. In addition, metal containers are one of the most recycled packages in the world and are infinitely recyclable. 
CUSTOM CONTAINERS BUSINESS
Our custom containers business competes with a number of large national producers of custom containers for personal care, food, health care, pharmaceutical, household and industrial chemical, pet food and care, agricultural, automotive and marine chemical products. These competitors include Alpha Packaging, Inc., Alpla-Werke Alwin Lehner GmbH & Co. KG, Amcor Limited, Berry Global Group, Inc., Cebal Americas, Altium Packaging LLC, Graham Packaging Company (part of Rank Group Limited) and Plastipak Holdings, Inc. In addition to our rapid response to our customers’ design, development and technology support needs and our value-added, diverse product line, we strive to remain current with and, to some extent, anticipate innovations in resin composition and applications and changes in the technology for the manufacturing of custom containers and closures.
SILGAN TEAM 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 3,800 salaried and 11,800 hourly employees on a full-time basis. Approximately 33 percent of our hourly plant employees in the United States and Canada as of that date were represented by a variety of unions, and most of our hourly employees in Europe, Asia, South America and Central America were represented by a variety of unions or other labor organizations. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, Campbell provided us with approximately 120 hourly employees on a full-time basis at one of the facilities that we lease from Campbell.
Our labor contracts expire at various times between 2022 and 2025. As of December 31, 2021, contracts covering approximately 7 percent of our hourly employees in the United States and Canada will expire during 2022. We expect no significant changes in our relations with these unions.
We believe our success is a result of our unrelenting focus on our core strategies and mission statement principles, which have been consistent since our founding and are captured in our mission statement. We focus on meeting the unique needs of our customers, pursuing growth where we have a competitive advantage and responding where we do not. Critical to our success are the contributions and efforts of the entire Silgan team who meet this challenge to compete and win in the markets we serve. Accordingly, investing in our people is vital for us. At each of our locations, we provide competitive compensation and benefits and strive to provide a safe, rewarding, diverse and inclusive workplace for our employees. The safety of our entire team is a top priority for us, as evidenced by our industry leading, low lost time and recordable rates. All of our locations remained, and continue to remain, open and operating during the COVID-19 pandemic because we are an essential provider of packaging for food, health and personal care products. During this period, we stayed, and continue to stay, steadfast on providing a safe workplace for our employees. At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were an early adopter of enhanced safety and health protocols and procedures to protect our employees and allow us to continue to supply our essential products to meet our customers’ critical needs. Such measures include implementing and encouraging appropriate social distancing and cleaning measures, securing and providing employees with additional personal protective equipment, placing restrictions on travel and third party visitors to our locations, mandating quarantine protocols and limiting in-person meetings and other gatherings and encouraging the use of virtual meetings, and we have incurred and continue to incur significant additional costs in connection with such enhanced safety and health protocols and procedures. We continue to monitor and track the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and are committed to proactively further enhancing our safety and health protocols and procedures for the protection of our employees and to remain aligned with applicable regulations and guidelines.
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS 
We are subject to federal, foreign, state and local governmental laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations and health and safety related laws and regulations. 
In general, environmental laws and regulations limit the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. We believe that we are either in compliance in all material respects with all presently applicable environmental laws and regulations or are operating in accordance with appropriate variances, schedules under compliance orders or similar arrangements.
In addition to costs associated with regulatory compliance, we may be held liable for alleged environmental damage associated with the past disposal of hazardous substances. Those that generate hazardous substances that are disposed of at sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist, as well as the owners of those sites and other classes of persons, are subject to claims for clean-up and natural resource damages under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal. CERCLA and many similar state and foreign statutes may hold a responsible party liable for the entire clean-up cost at a particular site even though that party may not have caused the entire problem. Other state statutes may impose proportionate rather than joint and several liability. The federal Environmental Protection Agency or a state or foreign agency may also issue orders requiring responsible parties to undertake removal or remedial actions at sites.
We are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act and other federal, foreign, state and local laws regulating noise exposure levels and other safety and health concerns in the production areas of our plants.
While management does not believe that any of the regulatory matters described above, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial position or competitive position, we cannot assure you that a material environmental or other regulatory claim will not arise in the future.
RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
Our research, product development and product engineering efforts relating to our dispensing and specialty closures business are conducted at our research facilities in Downers Grove, Illinois, Grandview, Missouri, Spokane, Washington, Mequon, Wisconsin, Hannover, Germany and Waalwijk, Netherlands. Our research, product development and product engineering efforts relating to our metal containers business are conducted at our research facilities in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin. Our research, product development and product engineering efforts with respect to our custom containers business are performed by our manufacturing and engineering personnel located at our custom containers manufacturing facilities. In addition to research, product development and product engineering, these sites also provide technical support to our customers. The amounts we have spent on research and development during the last three fiscal years are not material.
We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, unpatented know-how, technological innovation, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect our intellectual property. We do not believe that any individual item of our intellectual property portfolio is material to our business. We employ various methods, including confidentiality agreements and nondisclosure agreements, with third parties, employees and consultants to protect our trade secrets and know-how. However, others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets and know-how through independent development or other means.
