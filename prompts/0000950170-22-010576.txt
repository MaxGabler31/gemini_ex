ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Overview
 Skyline Champion Corporation, an Indiana corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to herein as "Skyline Champion," "us," "we," "our," the "Company," and any other similar terms, unless otherwise indicated in this Annual Report.
 We are a leading producer of factory-built housing in North America with net sales for the year ended April 2, 2022 (“fiscal 2022”) of approximately $2.2 billion. We have more than 70 years of homebuilding experience, approximately 8,400 employees and 41 manufacturing facilities located in 19 states across the United States and three provinces in western Canada. We offer a leading portfolio of manufactured and modular homes, park model RVs, accessory dwelling units (“ADUs”) and modular buildings for the multi-family and hospitality sectors. Our facilities are strategically located to serve strong markets in the United States and western Canada. We operated 14 manufacturing facilities in the top ten states with the highest number of manufactured homes shipped in fiscal 2022, as well as 16 manufacturing facilities in the ten states with the greatest growth in the number of manufactured homes shipped in the last ten years. We believe that we maintained the following leading positions in the factory-built housing industry in the United States and western Canada (based on units) in calendar year 2021:
 •Number two position in the manufactured housing market segment in the United States
 •Number one modular builder in the United States
 •A leading position in western Canada
 •A leading position in park model RV sales 
 We believe our market leading positions are driven by our comprehensive product offering, strong brand reputation, broad manufacturing footprint, and our complementary retail and logistics businesses. Our market share in the United States total housing market is approximately 2.6%. Our market share in the United States manufactured housing market segment has increased from approximately 8% in the beginning of fiscal 2011 to approximately 19% in fiscal 2022 based on total number of units produced.
We design and build a range of manufactured and modular homes, park model RVs, ADUs, and commercial structures. We believe that the high quality and broad scope of our product and service offerings provide us a competitive advantage relative to other factory-built and certain site-built homes. With our award-winning product designs, we seek to meet the needs of our localized customers, while also providing them with an array of pre-designed options. Our leading brands are marketed and distributed through a network of independent and company-owned retailers, community operators, government agencies, and builder/developers. We build homes under some of the most well-known brand names in the factory-built housing industry including Skyline Homes, Champion Home Builders, Genesis Homes, Athens Park Models, Dutch Housing, Atlantic Homes, Excel Homes, Homes of Merit, New Era, Redman Homes, ScotBilt Homes, Shore Park, Silvercrest, and Titan Homes in the U.S., and Moduline and SRI Homes in western Canada.
 In addition to our core home building business, we provide construction services to install and set-up factory-built homes, we operate a factory-direct manufactured home retail business, Titan Factory Direct, with 18 sales centers spanning the southern United States, and we operate Star Fleet Trucking, which provides transportation services to the manufactured housing and other industries from several dispatch locations across the United States.

Our principal executive offices are located at 755 West Big Beaver Road, Suite 1000, Troy, Michigan 48084. Our website is located at www.skylinechampion.com. Our website and the information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference and is not a part of this Annual Report. We make available on our website, as soon as reasonably practicable, all of the reports required to be filed with the SEC. Our SEC filings are also available to the public on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. 
Business Strategy
 We will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our revenue and earnings by constructing quality-built, sustainable, and innovatively designed homes and other modular structures in an environmentally friendly factory setting. In connection with executing this business strategy, we are focused on the following four initiatives:
 •Increasing the operating capacity and profitability of our existing facilities;
 •Investing in our customers’ online digital experience;
 •Implementing production automation and enterprise-wide digital technology; and
 •Continuing a balanced organic and acquisition-based growth strategy.
 Increasing the Operating Capacity and Profitability of our Existing Facilities
 We are currently focused on a number of ongoing operational initiatives to further enhance our operating margins and increase production capacity including:
 •refining our product floor plan designs and options to offer “designed flexibility” to our customers;
 •executing on continuous improvement initiatives related to procurement, operational and labor cost saving opportunities; enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of our products through value-adding material substitution; and
 •standardizing our manufacturing processes and employing metrics-driven accountability measures across all of our facilities.
 Investing in our Customers’ Online Digital Experience
 The Company continues to invest in the design and testing of enhanced digital offerings. We are currently piloting an end-to-end platform where consumers can design, configure, and price their homes online, which we believe will ultimately drive revenue growth for Skyline Champion and our channel partners. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen tremendous online interest from consumers and believe use of a digital platform to customize and purchase homes will continue to grow.
Implementing Production Automation and Enterprise-wide Digital Technology
 •We are investing in production automation technology to mitigate reliance on direct labor, reduce material waste, and improve the precision of our construction processes. 
 •In conjunction with our enhanced digital offering for the customer experience, we are moving to an enterprise-wide, cloud based integrated platform. This enhanced technology will offer real-time analytics for improved decision making and will facilitate additional improvements in our manufacturing operations. 
Continuing a Balanced Organic and Acquisition-Based Growth Strategy
 In June 2021, the Company acquired two idle facilities in Navasota, Texas in order to increase our production capabilities in the Texas market. The Company began production and completed the certification process at one of these facilities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.
 On February 28, 2021, we acquired ScotBilt Homes, LLC and related companies from SHI Group Holdings, Inc. (collectively, “ScotBilt”). ScotBilt operated two manufacturing facilities in Georgia providing affordable housing throughout Alabama, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. The acquisition helped to balance our national distribution and complement our existing manufacturing footprint in the attractive mid-south region. The operations of ScotBilt are included in our financial results since the date of the acquisition. During fiscal 2022, we completed the successful cultural, processes, systems and internal controls integration of the acquired facilities into our operations.
In January 2021, we closed on the purchase of two idled manufacturing facilities in North Carolina, one of the strongest growth states in the U.S. We anticipate beginning production at one of these facilities in late fiscal 2023.


We have demonstrated our ability to broaden our manufacturing and retail presence through the successful execution of a balanced organic growth and acquisition-based strategy. As demand for affordable housing grows and the raw material supply chain normalizes, we will continue to execute on this growth strategy. We believe our idle manufacturing plants provide us with the ability to grow with demand over the longer term. We also continue to explore opportunities to acquire value-enhancing retail locations, manufacturing facilities, and factory-built housing competitors to supplement our organic growth initiatives. We have a proven track-record of executing and integrating acquisitions.

Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
 We demonstrate our commitment to ESG through company-wide and plant-specific programs and through our everyday business practices when providing high-quality, yet affordable homes to U.S. and Canadian homebuyers. Manufactured and modular homes cost up to 50% less per square foot than conventional site-built homes, expanding the opportunity for individuals to own a home despite an ever-growing housing affordability gap.
 The Board of Directors has formal responsibility for the oversight and integration of all of the Company’s sustainability programs and policies, and the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Governance Committee have lead responsibility for the Company’s strategy, policies and practices with respect to environmental sustainability, social and human capital matters, and governance, respectively. Our five ESG tenets include: (1) Environmental Focus, (2) Health & Safety, (3) Human Capital, (4) Community Outreach, and (5) Governance.
 Skyline Champion manages its operations to minimize resource consumption and environmental impacts. We continue to identify opportunities to reduce our environmental impact across our operations by reducing raw material waste, designing and constructing energy efficient homes, conserving our natural resources through recycling programs and reducing our carbon footprint by producing our homes in factories close to where our customers and employees live. Many of our U.S. manufacturing facilities are certified to produce Energy Star® energy efficient rated homes through a special EPA program for manufactured housing. Environmental sustainability is at the forefront of what we do every day.
We construct manufactured homes in controlled environments. Our efficient construction process results in less energy usage and material waste compared to traditional site-built construction. In many of our plants, we have transitioned to LED lighting, and we recycle insulation material, lumber, metals, plastics, paper and many other products. In the course of executing our expansion plans, we have repurposed older buildings, both revitalizing the local community and preserving vacant land. This reduces the need for new building materials and extensive deployment of construction equipment, and thus reduces carbon emissions.
 On our journey, we have launched a program to participate in reforestation. With forestry products central to the construction of homes, we began participation in a program to plant one tree for every tree used in construction of our homes in fiscal 2022. Reforestation contributes to the environment by replenishing forests, reducing greenhouses gases ("GHG"), and protecting local watersheds.
 As a nationwide provider of affordable housing, we have a social responsibility to not only the buyers of our homes, our retail and community customers and our employees, but also to the communities in which they live and work. Many of our manufacturing facilities participate locally to support programs such as Habitat for Humanity and other local charities as well as work-study programs with local community colleges and high schools.
Skyline Champion is committed to good corporate governance. We strive to maintain strong governance practices that protect and enhance accountability for the benefit of Skyline Champion, its shareholders, customers, employees and other business stakeholders. We regularly review and refine our governance practices and policies to align with evolving issues. Our internal risk management team oversees compliance with applicable laws and regulations and coordinates with subject matter experts throughout the business to identify, monitor and mitigate risk including information security risk management and cyber defense programs. Skyline Champion’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, the charters of committees of our Board and our Code of Conduct can be found in the Governance Documents section under the Governance tab on our website at www.skylinechampion.com. Additional information on our Corporate Governance policies can be found in our Proxy Statement filed with the SEC.


Human Capital and Diversity
 The Skyline Champion team manages the business in accordance with the Company’s Core Operating Principles:
 •Build and develop exceptional teams
 •Create a safe work environment
 •Build strong relationships
 •Take pride in our craftsmanship
 •Act with integrity and respect
 •Be open and honest 
 •Run the business like it is your own
 We appreciate each member of the Skyline Champion team and the unique skills and diversity of thought each provides to the overall success of the Company. We strive for an inclusive environment and reward individual contributions that foster innovative ideas for improving our products and workplace. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind including but not limited discrimination or harassment to on the basis of gender identity, race, religion, age or disabilities. We are committed to the development of our employees. The Company follows standard onboarding and training protocols for our direct labor team members and also offers management and OSHA training for our supervisors. We are committed to improving employee engagement and reducing turnover through these onboarding, training and mentoring activities. Depending on availability, our plants participate in local outreach programs and hire disadvantaged members of the local community.
 We have built a diverse team with a wide range of experiences. At April 2, 2022, we employed approximately 8,400 full and part time employees. Our human capital resource objectives include identifying, recruiting, training, retaining and incentivizing our employees. We offer our employees a competitive compensation package, including an array of benefits, and we deem our relationship with our employees to be generally good. At April 2, 2022, our manufacturing facilities in Canada employed approximately 950 workers of which the majority belong to trade associations that operate under collective bargaining agreements. There are five collective bargaining agreements (one for each Canadian manufacturing facility) and each has separate expiration dates. The agreements are set to expire at various dates between June 2022 and June 2024.
 We are committed to conducting our business with integrity and in compliance with all applicable laws of the cities, states and countries in which we operate. We have adopted a written Code of Conduct and Ethics and in fiscal 2022 implemented a new company wide training program to assist employees in this regard. We encourage employees to report concerns through a variety of channels, including a compliance and ethics line which allows for anonymous reporting. All reports are investigated and resolved. We also maintain an anti-retaliation policy such that any employee who reports a concern in good faith is protected from harassment, retaliation or adverse employment consequences.
 We take the health and safety of our employees seriously. We provide a variety of Company sponsored healthcare programs, including health, dental, and vision, that allow employees to manage their and their family's health and wellbeing. We expect each employee to follow our safety standards and protocols. Our corporate Environmental Health and Safety (“EHS”) team works to benchmark and implement EHS best practices at our plants. Each of our locations performs regular safety audits to ensure that proper safety policies are in place and appropriate safety training is provided. In addition to training and development, we measure and report out on monthly safety metrics and regularly review our safety performance with our Board of Directors. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented standards to operate in accordance with social-distancing protocols and public health authority guidelines. In fiscal 2021 in response to the pandemic, the Company offered extended benefits to employees, including increased sick pay and waived premium payments on healthcare benefits for furloughed employees.

Factory-Built Housing
 A majority of our manufactured products are constructed in accordance with the regulations and rules of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, as amended ("HUD code"). We produce a broad range of manufactured and modular homes under a variety of brand names and in a variety of floor plans and price ranges. While most of the homes we build are single-family, multi-section, ranch-style homes, we also build two-story and single-section homes, as well as multi-family units such as town homes, apartments, duplexes, and triplexes. The single-family homes that we manufacture generally range in size from 400 to 4,000 square feet and typically include two to four bedrooms, a living room or family room, a dining room, a kitchen and typically two full bathrooms. We also build park model RVs for resorts and campgrounds, ADUs for backyard or recreational living, and commercial modular structures.
 We regularly introduce homes with new floor plans, exterior designs and elevations, decors and features. Our corporate marketing and engineering departments work with our manufacturing facilities to design homes that appeal to consumers’ changing

tastes at appropriate price points for their respective markets. We design and build homes with a traditional residential or site-built appearance through the use of, among other features, dormers and higher pitched roofs. We offer our Genesis brand of homes which have features similar to site-built home amenities such as porches and garages. These homes are designed to be eligible for financing programs with terms similar to traditional mortgages. We are also very active in the design and construction of energy-efficient homes.
 The components and products used in factory-built housing are generally of the same quality as those used by other home builders, including conventional site-builders. The primary components include lumber, plywood, OSB, drywall, steel, floor coverings, insulation, exterior siding (vinyl, composites, wood and metal), doors, windows, shingles, kitchen appliances, furnaces, plumbing and electrical fixtures and hardware. These components are presently available from a variety of sources and we are not dependent upon any single supplier. Prices of certain materials such as lumber, insulation, steel, and drywall can fluctuate significantly due to changes in demand and supply. Lumber and related products experienced significant cost increases in fiscal 2022, primarily as a result of supply chain disruptions. Those disruptions have also impacted the availability of certain raw materials and components. We endeavor to mitigate the impact of supply chain challenges through sourcing alternative materials, where appropriate, and exploring alternative supply options. We generally have been able to pass higher material costs on to customers in the form of surcharges and price increases. Typically, a one to three-week supply of raw materials is maintained, but continued supply chain volatility has caused our manufacturing operations to increase the amount of frequently used raw materials on hand versus what is typically carried.
Most completed factory-built homes have components consistent with conventional site-builders, such as cabinets, wall and floor coverings, appliances, and electrical, heating and plumbing systems. Optional factory installed features include fireplaces, dormers, entertainment centers and skylights. Upon completion of the home at the factory, homes sold to retailers are transported to a retail sales center or directly to the home site. Homes sold to builders and developers are generally transported directly to the home site. At the home site, the home is placed on a foundation or otherwise affixed to the property and readied for occupancy, either by our employee set crews or third party contractors. The sections (also referred to as floors) of a multi-section home are joined and the interior and exterior seams are finished at the home site. The consumer purchase of the home may also include retailer or contractor supplied items such as additional appliances, air conditioning, furniture, porches, decks, and garages.
 We construct homes in indoor facilities using an assembly-line process employing approximately 100 to 200 production employees at each facility. Factory-built HUD code homes are constructed in one or more sections affixed to a steel support frame that allows the sections to be moved through the assembly line and transported upon sale. The sections of many of the modular homes we produce are built on wooden floor systems and transported on carriers that are removed upon placement of the home at the home site. Each section or floor is assembled in stages, beginning with the construction of the frame and the floor, then adding the walls, ceiling and roof assembly, and other constructed and purchased components, and ending with a final quality control inspection. The efficiency of the assembly-line process, protection from the weather, and favorable pricing of materials resulting from our substantial purchasing power enables us to produce homes more quickly and often at a lower cost than a conventional site-built home of similar quality.
The production schedules of our homebuilding facilities are based upon customer orders. Orders are generally subject to cancellation at any time up to the commencement of production without penalty and are not necessarily an indication of future business. Retailers place orders for retail stocking (inventory) purposes and for homebuyer orders. Before scheduling homes for production, orders and availability of financing are confirmed with our customer and, where applicable, their customer's lender. Because we produce homes to fulfill wholesale orders, our factories generally do not carry finished goods inventories, except for homes awaiting delivery. We manage our production levels, capacity and workforce size based upon current market demands. Historically, orders were generally filled within 90 days of receipt; however, delivery times have been extended over the past two years due to the increase in our sales backlog caused by strong demand for affordable housing. At April 2, 2022, we had a backlog of home orders with wholesale sales value of approximately $1.6 billion. After production of a particular home has commenced, the order becomes noncancelable and the customer is obligated to take delivery of the home.
 Although factory-built homes can be produced throughout the year in indoor facilities, demand for homes is usually affected by inclement weather and by the cold winter months in northern areas of the U.S. and in Canada. Charges to transport homes increase with the distance from the factory to the retailer or home site. As a result, most of the retailers and builders/developers we sell to are located within a 500-mile radius of our manufacturing plants. In addition to our traditional channels of distribution, we are one of a limited number of manufactured homebuilders that have been approved for contracts with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) and have historically provided housing assistance requirements following natural disasters and other housing emergencies. On February 7, 2022, we received a Delivery Disaster Relief Order from FEMA for approximately $200 million in revenue to be completed by September 2022.
 We offer a wide selection of manufactured and modular homes as well as park model RVs at company-owned retail locations marketed under the Titan Factory Direct brand. We maintain our company-owned retail presence through 18 retail sales centers in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Texas. Our captive retail distribution enhances the reach of our factory-built housing products directly to the homebuyer.


Each of our full-service retail sales centers has a sales office and a variety of model homes of various sizes, floor plans, features, and prices that are displayed in a residential setting with sidewalks and landscaping. Customers may purchase a home from an inventory of homes maintained at the location, including a model home, or may order a home that will be built at a manufacturing facility. Our retail organization provides industry leadership with the expertise to be responsive to local economic conditions and ultimately provide affordable homes to value-conscious homebuyers.
 During fiscal 2022, the average selling price was $80,656 for our U.S. factory-built homes and $107,589 for homes sold through our Canadian housing segment. Manufactured home sales prices ranged from $20,000 to over $350,000. Retail sales prices of the homes, without land, generally ranged from $35,000 to over $300,000, depending upon size, floor plan, features, and options.
 
Logistics
 We operate a logistics business, Star Fleet Trucking, specializing in the transportation of manufactured homes and recreational vehicles from manufacturing facilities to retailers. Star Fleet’s delivery logistics are coordinated through dispatch terminals located throughout the U.S. Star Fleet has strong relationships with its customer base, which includes some of the largest manufactured housing companies (including our own factory-built housing operations), and recreational vehicle manufacturers in the U.S.
Market Overview
General. Since July 2020, U.S. and Canadian housing demand has been robust. The limited availability of existing homes for sale and the broader need for newly built affordable, single-family housing has continued to drive demand for new homes in these markets. Factory-built housing provides an affordable alternative to other types of housing such as site-built housing and condominiums, and to existing housing such as pre-owned homes and apartments. According to statistics published by the Institute for Building Technology and Safety ("IBTS") and the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, for the 2021 calendar year, manufactured housing wholesale shipments of homes constructed in accordance with the HUD code accounted for an estimated 10% of all new single-family homes starts.
 According to data reported by the Manufactured Housing Institute (“MHI”), industry manufactured home shipments were 108,964, 95,588, and 97,553 units during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Annual shipments have generally increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD-coded manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD-coded manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, manufactured housing’s most recent annual shipment levels still operate at lower levels than the long-term historical average of over 200,000 units annually. The market for factory-built housing is affected by a number of factors, including the availability, cost and credit underwriting standards of consumer financing, consumer confidence, employment levels, general housing market, interest rates and other economic conditions and the overall affordability of factory-built housing versus other forms of housing. In the past, a number of factors have restricted demand for factory-built housing, including, in some cases, less-favorable financing terms compared to site-built housing, the effects of restrictive zoning on the availability of certain locations for home placement and, in some cases, an unfavorable public image. Certain of these adverse factors have lessened considerably in recent years with the improved quality and appearance of factory-built housing.
Home Buyer Demographics. We believe the segment of the housing market in which manufactured housing is most competitive includes consumers with household incomes under $60,000. This segment has a high representation of young single persons and married couples, first time home buyers, and homebuyers age 55 and older. The comparatively low cost of manufactured homes is attractive to these consumers. People in rural areas, where fewer housing alternatives exist, and those who presently live in factory-built homes, also make up a significant portion of the demand for new factory-built housing. We believe higher-priced, multi-section manufactured and modular homes are attractive to households with higher incomes as an alternative to rental housing and condominiums and are well suited to meet the needs of the retiree buyer in many markets.
 The two largest manufactured housing consumer demographics are Millennials (generally defined as those born between 1981 – 1996) and Baby Boomers (generally defined as those born between 1946 – 1964). Millennials are generally first-time home buyers who may be attracted by the affordability and diversity of style choices of factory-built homes. Baby Boomers are similarly interested in the value proposition; however, they are also motivated by the energy efficiency and low maintenance requirements of factory-built homes, and by the lifestyle offered by planned communities that are specifically designed for homeowners that fall into this age group. More recently, we have seen a number of market trends pointing to increased sales of ADUs and urban-to-rural migration as customers accommodate working from home patterns as well as people seeking rent-to-own single-family options.
 
Financing
 Commercial Financing. Independent retailers of factory-built homes generally finance their inventory purchases from manufacturers with floor plan financing provided by third-party lending institutions and secured by a lien on the homes. The availability and cost of floor plan financing can affect the amount of retailer new home inventory, the number of retail sales centers and related wholesale demand. Under a typical floor plan financing arrangement, an independent financial institution specializing in

this line of business provides the retailer with a loan for the purchase price of the home and maintains a security interest in the home as collateral. The financial institution customarily requires us, as the manufacturer of the home, to enter into a separate repurchase agreement with the financial institution that, upon default by the retailer and under certain other circumstances, obligates us to repurchase the financed home at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement (which, in most cases, is 18 to 36 months). The price at which we may be obligated to repurchase a home under these agreements is based upon the amount financed, plus certain administrative and shipping expenses. Our obligation under these repurchase agreements ceases upon the purchase of the home by the retail customer. The maximum amount of our contingent obligations under such repurchase agreements was approximately $339.5 million as of April 2, 2022. The risk of loss under these agreements is spread over many retailers and is further reduced by the resale value of the homes. During fiscal 2022, approximately 39% of our sales to independent retailers were financed under floor plan agreements with national lenders, while the remaining 61% were financed under various arrangements with local or regional banks or paid in cash. We generally receive payment from the lending institution 5 to 10 days after a home is sold and invoiced.
 Consumer Financing. Sales of factory-built homes are significantly affected by the availability, credit underwriting standards, and cost of consumer financing. There are three basic types of consumer financing in the factory-built housing industry: 1) conforming mortgage loans which comply with the requirements of the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Agriculture or Government-Sponsored Enterprise (“GSE”) loans which include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans; 2) non-conforming mortgage loans for purchasers of the home and the land on which the home is placed; and 3) personal property loans (often referred to as home-only or chattel loans) for consumers where the home is the sole collateral for the loan (generally HUD-coded homes).
Industry trade associations are working towards favorable legislative and GSE action to address the mortgage financing needs of potential buyers of affordable homes, and some progress has been achieved. Many moderate-income families cannot afford to buy a home due to the increasing costs of newly constructed homes, rising interest rates, and decreasing supply of existing, affordable homes. Federal law required the GSEs to issue a regulation to implement the Duty to Serve (“DTS”) requirements specified in the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac released their final Underserved Markets Plan for 2022 – 2024 that describes, with specificity, the actions they will take over that three-year period to fulfill the DTS obligation. These plans became effective on January 1, 2022. The GSEs' Underserved Markets Plan's current areas of focus are as follows: 1) purchase more loans used to finance manufactured homes titled as real property; 2) enhance current products and create new offerings; and 3) enhance tenant protections in manufactured housing communities. In 2020, the GSEs rolled out financing programs specifically for homes built to the HUD code, which include CHOICEHome® from Freddie Mac and MH Advantage® from Fannie Mae. HUD-coded homes manufactured for these programs have features comparable to site-built homes, including, drywall throughout, higher-pitch roof line, energy-efficient features, lower profile foundation, plus additional options such as a garage or carport. These products aim to promote quality manufactured homes as an acceptable alternative to site-built homes and will allow moderate-income families to purchase a manufactured home with lending terms similar to those for site-built homes. Our Genesis brand of homes is built to these specifications. We continue to work with builder/developers to cultivate strategies to bring these products to the marketplace.
 The DTS plans also explored the potential for the GSEs to provide liquidity to the chattel lending market. The GSEs could potentially serve as additional sources of funding as there is unmet demand in the chattel loan industry, and GSE involvement could increase volume substantially. Freddie Mac has indicated that it plans to develop requirements and a process to support loan purchases of manufactured homes titled as real property. The Fannie Mae DTS plan includes a provision indicating that it is exploring a pilot to establish a secondary market for chattel or home-only loans and an objective to explore ways to manage risks in the market. The Fannie Mae DTS plan also includes an objective to explore opportunities to facilitate financing of loans secured by manufactured homes tiled as real property in certain manufactured housing communities. Expansion of the secondary market for home-only lending through the GSEs could provide further demand for housing, as lending options would likely become more available to homebuyers. Separate from the GSE involvement in chattel markets, there have been several secondary market chattel private placement offerings over the last three years. Although some limited progress has been made in this area, a meaningful positive impact in the form of increased home orders has yet to be realized.
 
Competition
 The housing industry is highly competitive based upon several factors, including price, product features, reputation for service and quality, depth of distribution or location, and financing. Capital requirements for entry into the industry are relatively low.
 Factory-built housing is also very competitive. According to MHI, in March 2022, there were 33 producers of manufactured homes in the U.S. operating an estimated 141 production facilities. For calendar 2021, the top three companies had a combined market share for HUD code homes of approximately 75%. We estimate that there were approximately 3,200 industry retail locations throughout the U.S. during calendar 2021.

Based on industry data reported by IBTS, in fiscal 2022 our U.S. wholesale market share of HUD code homes sold was 19.3%, compared to 16.9% in fiscal 2021. We compete with the other producers of manufactured homes, as well as companies selling homes repossessed from wholesalers or consumers. In addition, manufactured homes compete with new and existing site-built homes, as well as apartments, townhouses, and condominiums. Collectively, manufactured housing represents approximately only nine percent of annual U.S. single family home starts.
 There are a number of other national manufacturers competing for a significant share of the manufactured housing market in the U.S., including Clayton Homes and Cavco Industries. Certain of these competitors may possess greater financial, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing resources.
 
Government Regulation
 Our manufactured homes are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, codes and regulations. The majority of our homes are built to comply with the HUD code which includes regulations that cover all aspects of manufactured home construction and installation, including structural integrity, fire safety, wind loads, thermal protection and ventilation. To the extent state and local regulations conflict with the HUD code, they are pre-empted. Our modular homes and commercial structures are built to comply with applicable state and local building codes. Our park model RVs are built in conformity with the applicable standards approved by the American National Standards Institute, a private, non-profit organization that administers and coordinates voluntary standards and conformity programs.
 A variety of laws affect the financing of the homes we manufacture. The Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder require written disclosure of information relating to such financing, including the amount of the annual percentage interest rate and the finance charge. A variety of state laws also regulate the form of financing documents and the allowable deposits, finance charge and fees charged. Federal laws permit manufactured housing retailers to assist home buyers with securing financing for the purchase of homes; however, they are prohibited from negotiating the financing terms.
Governmental authorities enforcing these numerous laws and regulations can impose fines and/or seek injunctive relief for violations. We believe that our operations are in compliance with the requirements of the applicable laws and regulations.
Seasonality
 The housing industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations based on home buyer purchasing patterns. We typically experience decreased home buyer traffic during holidays and popular vacation periods. Demand for our core single-family new home products typically peaks each spring and summer before declining in the winter, consistent with the overall housing industry. Typical seasonal patterns were not as prevalent in fiscal 2022 and 2021 as demand for affordable housing has increased significantly. We expect seasonal patterns to return once demand returns to more typical levels.
