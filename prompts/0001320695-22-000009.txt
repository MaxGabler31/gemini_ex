Item 1.    Business 
Overview
References herein to "we," "us," "our," "Company," and "TreeHouse" refer to TreeHouse Foods, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context specifically states or implies otherwise.
TreeHouse is a leading manufacturer and distributor of private label foods and beverages in North America. We operate in 29 product categories across our Meal Preparation and Snacking & Beverages divisions and have approximately 40 production facilities across North America and Italy. Across our diverse portfolio, we have a private label leadership position in many categories and offer a range of better-for-you and nutritional solutions, such as items defined by our customers to be organic, or gluten-free, across nearly every category. Our purpose is to make high quality food and beverages affordable to all. Our vision is to be the undisputed solutions leader for our custom brands. Our mission is to create value as our customers' preferred manufacturing and distribution partner, providing thought leadership, superior innovation, and a relentless focus on execution.
The Company was incorporated on January 25, 2005 by Dean Foods Company to accomplish a spin-off of certain specialty businesses to its shareholders, which was completed on June 27, 2005. Since the Company began operating as an independent entity, it has expanded its product offerings through a number of acquisitions to add strategic value. We manufacture and sell the following:
•private label products to retailers, such as supermarkets, mass merchandisers, and specialty retailers, for resale under the retailers’ own or controlled labels;
•private label and branded products to the foodservice industry, including foodservice distributors and national restaurant operators;
•branded products under our own proprietary brands, primarily on a regional basis to retailers;
•branded products under co-pack agreements to other major branded companies for their distributions; and
•products to our industrial customer base for repackaging in portion control packages and for use as ingredients by other food manufacturers.
We operate our business as Bay Valley Foods, LLC ("Bay Valley"), Sturm Foods, Inc., S.T. Specialty Foods, Inc., Associated Brands, Inc., TreeHouse Foods Services, LLC, Protenergy Natural Foods, Inc., TreeHouse Private Brands, Inc., American Italian Pasta Company, Linette Quality Chocolates, Inc., Ralcorp Frozen Bakery Products, Inc., Cottage Bakery, Inc., and The Carriage House Companies, Inc. in the United States, E.D. Smith Foods, Ltd., Associated Brands, Inc., Protenergy Natural Foods Corporation, BFG Canada Ltd., and Western Waffles Corp. in Canada, and Pasta Lensi, S.r.l. in Italy. Bay Valley is a Delaware limited liability company, and a 100% owned subsidiary of TreeHouse. All operating units are directly or indirectly 100% owned subsidiaries of Bay Valley.
Our Strategy
Our long-term strategic objective is to build a company that is well positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth and create value for our shareholders, enabled by our two-segment structure and four-point enterprise strategy. Our Meal Preparation segment, which is primarily comprised of mature categories and sells center of the store grocery and main course meal items, is focused on generating stable, predictable cash flow, and improving profitability. Our Snacking & Beverages segment, which is primarily comprised of growth categories and sells sweet and savory baked food items and beverages and drink mixes, is focused on improving revenue and profit growth. Our four-point enterprise strategy includes a focus on commercial excellence, operational excellence, portfolio optimization, and people & talent.
•Commercial Excellence. An unrelenting focus on the customer is at the heart of everything we do. To be a solutions provider, we strive to: understand our customers' needs and challenges; execute flawlessly; produce products that meet quality and safety standards and are competitively priced; and continue to innovate. We believe that our go-to-market platform will lead us to stronger and more valuable partnerships with our customers. During 2021, we invested significantly to support our customers, bearing the near-term impact of rising inflationary costs to secure ingredients and transportation, as we faced headwinds through industry-wide supply chain disruption and labor availability challenges. We continue to execute pricing actions to recover the escalating inflation. We do so by maintaining ongoing dialogue and collaborating with our customers, in turn, strengthening our relationships as we operate in this extraordinarily challenging macro environment.
•Operational Excellence. We strive to be the supplier of choice and a world-class partner to our customers, a great investment to our shareholders, and a great place to work for our employees. We are building a high performance culture, as we communicate and engage our people with common metrics and operate with a continuous improvement mindset whereby the status quo is challenged. We also continue to optimize our plant and line network to simplify and streamline operations. During 2021, we maintained service at target levels for part of the year, and at an average of approximately 96% for the year while we worked to pivot our labor strategy, mitigate the industry-wide supply chain disruption in our network, and focus on continuous improvement and lean manufacturing initiatives.
•Optimized Portfolio. We periodically review our portfolio in an attempt to identify areas of optimization. As part of this review, we may identify specific businesses (typically lower growth and lower margin) which may be better served by a fundamental change in tactics, strategy, or ownership. Optimizing our portfolio allows us to focus our resources, drive improved results and generate higher levels of cash flow. During 2021, we further optimized our portfolio with the divestiture of the Ready-to-eat ("RTE") Cereal business which operated as two manufacturing plants located in Lancaster, Ohio and Sparks, Nevada.
•People & Talent. We continue to build a performance-based culture by communicating clear goals and fostering decision ownership. Our goal is to align and incentivize our people and celebrate our successes together. In 2021, we continued to prioritize the health and safety of our workforce. We also launched a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ("DEI") Council as part of our environmental, social, and governance ("ESG") agenda. This council will develop our DEI Strategic Roadmap with the objective of fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace.
Recent Acquisitions and Divestitures
On June 1, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its RTE Cereal business to Post Holdings, Inc. ("Post"). RTE Cereal operated as two manufacturing plants located in Lancaster, Ohio and Sparks, Nevada. The RTE Cereal business had been classified as a discontinued operation through the date of the sale. 
On December 11, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of the majority of the U.S. branded pasta portfolio as well as a manufacturing facility in St. Louis, Missouri of Riviana Foods, Inc. ("Riviana Foods"), a subsidiary of Ebro Foods, S.A. ("Ebro Foods"). The pasta acquisition is included in the Meal Preparation reporting segment.
On April 17, 2020, the Company completed the sale of two of its In-Store Bakery facilities located in Fridley, Minnesota and Lodi, California, which manufacture breads, rolls, and cakes for in-store retail bakeries and food-away-from-home customers. These two facilities were included within the Snacking & Beverages reporting segment. 
On August 1, 2019, the Company completed the sale of its Snacks division to Atlas Holdings, LLC. ("Atlas").
Refer to Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
Plan to Explore Strategic Alternatives to Maximize Value
On November 8, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors has approved a plan to explore strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of the Company or a transaction to allow the Company to focus on its higher growth Snacking & Beverages business segment by divesting a significant portion of its Meal Preparation business segment. The determination follows the Company’s ongoing, Board-led strategic review which began earlier this year.
There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in a transaction or other strategic changes or outcomes. Consequently, the Company may incur restructuring, impairment, disposal or other related charges in future periods as a result of the strategic plan. The Company has not set a timetable for the conclusion of its review.
Our Segments
We manage and report our operating results through two divisions, which are our reportable segments: Meal Preparation and Snacking & Beverages. Our long-term strategic objective is to build a company that is well positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth and create value for our shareholders, as enabled by our two-segment structure.
Our two segments have distinct focuses and approaches based upon their underlying categories as described below:
•Meal Preparation - Our Meal Preparation segment is focused on generating stable, predictable cash flow and improving profitability. Its strategic initiatives include mastering the fundamentals of cost, quality and service, managing product and channel mix to improve margin, and driving value from product optimization. This segment is primarily comprised of mature categories and includes center of the store grocery items (such as single-serve coffee, powdered creamer, dressings, dips, sauces, salsas, syrups, pasta sauces, jams and jellies, pickles, and cheese sauces) and main course meal items (such as dough, dry dinners, hot cereals, and pasta) in shelf stable and refrigerated formats for retail, food-away-from-home, co-manufacturing, industrial, ingredient, and export customers. 
•Snacking & Beverages - Our Snacking and Beverages segment is focused on improving revenue and profit growth. Its strategic initiatives include building depth and category leadership to drive growth, both organic growth and inorganic growth through acquisitions, and mastering the fundamentals of cost, quality, and service. This segment is primarily comprised of growth categories and produces and sells a comprehensive portfolio of sweet and savory baked food items (such as cookies, crackers, frozen waffles, pita chips, pretzels, snack bars, and unique candy products) and beverages and drink mixes (such as powdered drinks, broths/stocks, ready-to-drink beverages, coffee/tea concentrates, and bagged specialty tea) in shelf stable, refrigerated, and frozen formats primarily for retail and co-manufacturing customers.
See Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information by segment.
Sales and Distribution
We sell our products through various distribution channels, including retailers, foodservice distributors, co-manufacturers, and industrial and export channels. Retailers include grocery, supermarkets, mass merchandisers, club stores, e-commerce grocers, non-traditional grocers, and other small outlets. The Company's primary sales channel is through the retail grocery channel, with approximately 80% of the net sales sold through this channel. Foodservice distributors are included in our food-away-from-home sales channel, which primarily includes restaurants and other public venues. We have an internal sales force that manages customer relationships and a broker network for sales to retail, food-away-from-home, and export accounts. Industrial food products are generally sold directly to customers without the use of a broker. Co-manufacturing agreements are entered into with certain customers to add volume capacity by manufacturing and packaging our customers' product. Industrial and export channels include food manufacturers and repackagers of foodservice products. Most of our customers purchase products from us either by purchase order or pursuant to contracts that generally are terminable at will.
Products are generally shipped from our production facilities directly to customers, or from warehouse distribution centers where products are consolidated for shipment to customers if an order includes products manufactured in more than one production facility or product category. We believe this consolidation of products enables us to improve customer service by offering our customers a single order, invoice, and shipment. Some customers also pick up their orders at our production facilities or distribution centers.
Customers
A relatively limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our consolidated net sales. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 55.8% of our consolidated net sales. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our largest customer, Walmart Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 22.5%, 23.9%, and 24.4%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated net sales. 
Markets and Competition
Our business faces intense competition from large branded manufacturers and highly competitive private label and foodservice manufacturers. In some instances, large branded companies manufacture private label products. The industries in which we compete are expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future.
There has been significant consolidation in the retail grocery and foodservice industries in recent years resulting in mass merchandisers and non-traditional grocers, such as those offering a limited assortment of products, gaining market share. As our customer base continues to consolidate, we expect competition to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer large customers. Additionally, the introduction of e-commerce grocers brings new opportunities and risks. There can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing customers or gain new customers. Our customers do not typically commit to buy predetermined amounts of products, and many retailers utilize bidding procedures to select vendors. As the consolidation of the retail grocery and foodservice industry continues, we could lose sales and profits if any one or more of our existing customers were to be sold, or if limited assortment stores reduce the variety of products that we sell. Both the difficult economic environment and the increased competitive environment in the retail and food-away-from-home channels have caused competition to become increasingly intense in our business.
We have several competitors in each of our channels. For sales of private label products to retailers, the principal competitive factors are product quality, reliability of service, and price. For sales of products to food-away-from-home, co-manufacturing customers, industrial, and export customers, the principal competitive factors are price, product quality, specifications, and reliability of service.
Competition to obtain shelf space for our branded products with retailers generally is based on the expected or historical performance of our product sales relative to our competitors. The principal competitive factors for sales of our branded products to consumers are brand recognition and loyalty, product quality, promotion, and price. Some of our branded competitors have significantly greater resources and brand recognition than we do.
Trends impacting competition include an increase in snacking and awareness of healthier and "better for you" foods. These trends, together with a surge of specialty retailers who cater to consumers looking for either the highest quality ingredients, unique packaging, products to satisfy particular dietary needs, or value offerings where consumers are looking to maximize their food purchasing power, create pressure on manufacturers to provide a full array of products to meet customer and consumer demand.
Demand for our products is impacted by consumer behavior and preferences. The Company's sales channels are primarily through the retail grocery channel, with approximately 80% of the net sales sold through this channel. As a result, macroeconomic trends that impact where an end consumer purchases food products are favorable to the Company when there is greater at-home consumption instead of food-away-from-home consumption by the end consumer. Additionally, the majority of food-away-from home channel sales are within our Meal Preparation segment. Therefore, at-home consumption preferences by the end consumer are less pronounced within this segment as the benefit from retail grocery is offset by the adverse impact from food-away-from home. However, our Snacking & Beverages segment is mostly comprised of retail grocery, and therefore, this segment mostly benefits from at-home consumption. Other macroeconomic trends that influence consumer purchasing behavior demand include, but are not limited to, consumer income and government stimulus, inflation, and unemployment. Challenging macroeconomic conditions for the end consumer generally favor our business as our private label products offer competitive pricing compared to branded products. Branded products have a competitive advantage over private label products due to name recognition. In addition, when branded competitors focus on price and promotion, the environment for our private label business becomes more challenging because the price differential between private label products and branded products may become less significant.
We believe our strategies for competing in each of our business segments, which include providing superior product quality, effective cost control, an efficient supply chain, successful innovation programs, and competitive pricing, allow us to compete effectively.

Resources
Raw Materials and Supplies: Our raw materials consist of ingredients and packaging materials. Principal ingredients used in our operations include casein, cheese, cocoa, coconut oil, coffee, corn and corn syrup, cucumbers, eggs, fruit, non-fat dry milk, oats, palm oil, peppers, soybean oil, sugar, tea, tomatoes, and wheat (including durum wheat). These ingredients are generally purchased under supply contracts. We believe these ingredients generally are available from a number of suppliers. The cost of raw materials used in our products fluctuate due to weather conditions, climate change, regulations, fuel prices, energy costs, labor shortages, labor disputes, freight transportation delays or availability, disruption in logistics, political unrest, industry, general U.S. and global economic conditions, or other unforeseen circumstances. The most important packaging materials and supplies used in our operations are cartons, composite cans, corrugated containers, glass, metal cans, metal closures, and plastics. Most packaging materials are purchased under long-term supply contracts. We believe these packaging materials are generally available from a number of suppliers. Volatility in the cost of our raw materials and packaging supplies can adversely affect our performance, as price changes often lag behind changes in costs, and we are not always able to adjust our pricing to reflect changes in raw material and supply costs. 
For additional discussion of the risks associated with the raw materials used in our operations, see Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors and Part II, Item 7 - Known Trends or Uncertainties.
Trademarks: We own a number of registered trademarks. While we consider our trademarks to be valuable assets, we do not consider any trademark to be of such material importance that its absence would cause a material disruption of our business.
Seasonality
In the aggregate, our sales are generally weighted slightly toward the second half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter, with a more pronounced impact on profitability. As our product portfolio has grown, we have shifted to a higher percentage of cold weather products. Products that show a higher level of seasonality include non-dairy powdered creamer, coffee, specialty teas, cappuccinos, hot cereal, saltine and entertainment crackers, in-store bakery items, refrigerated dough products, and certain pasta products, all of which generally have higher sales in the first and fourth quarters. Additionally, sales of broth are generally higher in the fourth quarter. Warmer weather products such as dressings, pickles, and condiments typically have higher sales in the second quarter, while drink mixes generally show higher sales in the second and third quarters. The higher sales during seasonal periods impact our profitability as our manufacturing plants run at higher capacities and have more favorable fixed cost overhead absorption due to the higher volumes.
Our short-term financing needs are primarily for financing working capital and are generally highest in the first and third quarters as inventory levels increase relative to other quarters, due to the seasonal nature of our business. As a result of our product portfolio and the related seasonality, our financing needs are generally highest in the first and third quarters, while cash flow is highest in the second and fourth quarters following the seasonality of our sales.
Due to shelter-in-place and social distancing measures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw significant changes in product consumption patterns on our seasonality as consumers stocked their pantries and modified their purchasing habits in response to the pandemic, particularly in March and April 2020. This change in consumption demand in 2020 impacted comparability year-over-year. Additionally, the impact on profitability from our seasonality was disrupted by commodity inflation, supply chain disruption, and labor shortages in 2021. For additional discussion on product consumption patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, commodity inflation, supply chain disruption, and labor shortages, see Part II, Item 7 - Known Trends or Uncertainties - COVID-19.
Government Regulation
The conduct of our businesses, and the production, distribution, sale, labeling, safety, transportation, and use of our products, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state, and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets where we operate.
We are subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business including laws relating to water consumption and treatment, air quality, waste handling and disposal, and other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. We are committed to meeting all applicable environmental compliance requirements.
Changes in these laws or regulations, or the introduction of new laws or regulations, could increase the costs of doing business for the Company, our customers, or suppliers, or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.
Human Capital
People & Talent is one of our four pillars of our enterprise strategy. Investing in people assists our talent in delivering upon our enterprise strategy. Our human capital initiatives are grounded in our set of values called The TreeHouse Way, which includes: Own It, Commit to Excellence, Be Agile, Speak Up, and Better Together. Aligning to these values enables our people to more effectively collaborate, execute, and take advantage of the growth opportunities for our business. We drive our culture and human capital strategies by embedding these values across the employee management process by operationalizing these values in our hiring practices, performance management processes, and our approach to leadership development and training. 
As of December 31, 2021, our work force consisted of approximately 10,000 full-time employees, with 8,100 in the United States, 1,800 in Canada, and 100 in Italy. Approximately 2,300 were salaried, and 7,700 were hourly employees. Approximately 2,000 were unionized, and 8,000 were non-union employees. We have not experienced any material interruptions of operations due to disputes with our employees and consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. Key areas of focus for the Company include:
Health and Safety: The safety of our employees is a top priority. Our business could not operate without our team members, and our plant employees are essential to the success of our company. TreeHouse is committed to continuing to embed safety into the culture of our business and deploying systems that provide every team member with the tools they need to do their job safely and comfortably every day. We established a common plant structure for our Environmental, Health, Safety and Risk Management ("EHS&RM") organization at our facilities. This allows us to streamline our EHS oversight processes and better focus our resources on safety risk identification and mitigation. We also adapted our safety communications to clearly convey the roles and responsibilities for this new organization and to deliver consistent safety messaging. This increased transparency, paired with the development of frontline employee safety committees, allows our employees at all levels to take ownership over creating a safety-first workplace and culture. Safety is incorporated into our TreeHouse Management Operating System ("TMOS") and under TMOS, our plants are accountable to EHS Improvement Plans, Environmental Compliance Plans and standardized Incident Investigation and Communication processes.
Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion: We are committed to building a diverse team, fostering an inclusive culture, and investing in equity across our organization. We believe building a team diverse in ideas, experiences, and people enables us to be more successful in our jobs and better address the needs of customers and consumers. To further enhance our DEI Strategic Roadmap, we formed a DEI Council that is focused on four work streams which include expanding workforce representation through focusing on talent acquisition and retention, developing DEI capabilities through education and training, outlining an effective internal and external communication strategy, and determining the key performance indicators and goals that will help us measure success. As of December 31, 2021, 39% and 47% of our hourly and salaried workforce, respectively, were women, and 40% and 17% of our hourly and salaried workforce, respectively, were black, indigenous, and people of color ("BIPOC").
Learning and Development: Employee development is critical to provide our people with the skills and opportunities they need to excel and be engaged at work. In response to our employee engagement survey, we recently developed the Learning & Growing program. This program provides employees with the tools and resources they need to learn and grow their career at TreeHouse with clarity around the behaviors, experiences, and expectations of our employees. As a part of our Learning & Growing program, we have rolled out tools to help our employees and managers have meaningful career conversations, as well as effective performance management discussions focused on growth and development. We will continue to evolve this program offering throughout the year.
Compensation and Benefits: TreeHouse offers competitive pay and benefit packages, designed to drive our performance-based culture and celebrate our collective organizational success. We are committed to and invest heavily in providing employees with comprehensive, market-competitive benefits that support our employees’ health, wealth, and balance. We offer a variety of medical plans (including prescription drug coverage) with a range of coverage levels and costs which allows our employees to select the plan that best meets their individual needs. In addition, we offer employees dental and vision coverage, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, paternal leave, care benefits (including back-up child/elder care), tuition reimbursement programs, a 401(k) retirement savings plan with matching company contributions, life insurance, and voluntary short-term and long-term disability insurance. 
COVID-19 Response: Our COVID-19 management plan was built around the need to support all employees in managing their personal and professional challenges. Frequent and transparent communications were the focus at every level of the organization including those on the front lines to those in our corporate offices. To operationalize this commitment, we enacted the following measures in 2020 which remain in place in 2021: 
•We established a dedicated COVID-19 response team, a communication plan, and an internal intranet site with weekly leadership communications to stay connected frequently and transparently with all employees. We partnered with medical professionals to inform our decisions, allocated resources, and established task forces to support and manage our company-wide response.
•For front line employees at our facilities, we added enhanced safety measures, published protocols, implemented social distancing, and added physical barriers to minimize exposure throughout our facilities. Our response included providing face masks to all employees at all locations, temperature screening, the installation of additional hand washing and hand sanitizing stations, and increased the frequency of enhanced cleaning procedures. We also provided incentives for our essential employees, including supplemental pay and additional paid leave.
•We instituted work from home for all office employees, provided additional IT resources, suspended all non-essential business travel, and established a task force to promote employee safety. 
•Lastly, TreeHouse brought onboard a health navigation service to monitor changes to COVID-19 regulations and requirements and to launch an employee hotline to offer direct assistance when needed. The health navigation service also began engaging consumer packaged goods ("CPG") partners to lay the groundwork for access to vaccinations in 2021. As a result, we registered our sites as essential workplaces, and the Company coordinated onsite or offsite vaccination clinics at the majority of its locations.
Because of our collective efforts, we have been able to adapt to a rapidly changing environment, maintain our operations safely, and meet the needs of our customers and consumers.
