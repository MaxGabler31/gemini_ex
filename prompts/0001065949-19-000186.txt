ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
The following is a summary of some of the information contained in this document. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this document to “T-Rex” or the “Company” are to T-Rex Oil, Inc.
 
NOTE: This report is as of March 31, 2017. Subsequent to such date, due to the depressed oil prices, the business of the Company has been determined to be unsustainable due to lack of capital, and the Company is liquidating its assets and seeking a new business.
 
Corporate History 
 
T-Rex Oil, Inc. was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada as Rancher Energy Corp. (“Rancher”). On October 8, 2014, as approved by our board of directors and a written consent of our majority shareholder, an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation was filed in order to authorize a reverse split of the common stock issued and outstanding on a one (1) new share for three hundred fifty (350) old shares basis. At the same time, the Articles of Incorporation were amended to change our authorized capital to 275,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value common stock and 50,000,000 shares of $0.01 par value preferred stock. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) approved the amendment, effective October 29, 2014.
 
On October 17, 2014, we merged into our wholly owned subsidiary, T-Rex Oil, Inc., a Colorado corporation and as a result were re-domiciled in the state of Colorado.
 
On October 28, 2015, T-Rex Oil, Inc. (“the Company”) filed an Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to designate the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.
 
The Amendment designates 5,000,000 shares of the authorized 50,000,000 shares of the Company’s $0.001 par value preferred stock as the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“the Series A Shares.”) The Series A Shares are convertible into common shares of the Company’s stock 9 months after the date of issuance. Further, the Series A Shares have a conversion price based upon 80% of the 10 day average of the Company’s closing market price. The Series A Shares do not accrue dividends and have a deemed purchase price of $2.00 per share.
 
In October 2015, the Company commenced a private placement financing of $7,000,000 in Units, a Unit consisting of 1 share of its Series A Shares and a Unit Warrant. The Unit Warrant has an exercise price of $3.00 per share and a term of 3 years. The Unit Warrant is exercisable 9 months after issuance and is callable by the Company upon the Company’s common stock closing at a market price of $5.00 or above for a period of 10 days.
 
At March 31, 2016, the Company had received $793,038 of cash in exchange for the issuance of 409,019 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock and Unit Warrants exercisable for 409,019 shares of common stock.

On July 11, 2016, Nexfuels, Inc. was incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in the State of Colorado (“Nexfuels”). Nexfuels was created to develop the Company’s Carbon Dioxide Recovery Project. The Carbon Dioxide Recovery Project (“the Project”) is focused on the development of exhaust stack supplies of carbon dioxide for use in enhanced oil recovery. The project involves the development, build out and operation of a commercial scale carbon capture systems on existing coal fueled electric power plants in the United States, specifically in Wyoming.
 
The Company’s Board of Directors determined that to focus and better implement these strategies necessary to financing and build the Project, the Board of Directors approved the spin-off of Nexfuels on July 15, 2016.
 
Shareholders of T-Rex, as of the Record Date of August 19, 2016, received one share of Nexfuels common stock for every two shares (2) of T-Rex common stock owned. The stock dividend was based upon 17,097,622 shares of the Company’s common stock that were issued and outstanding as of the Record Date.
 
As part of the spin-off of Nexfuels, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mr. Donald Walford and a director of the Company Mr. Sears were appointed to the Board of Directors of Nexfuels.
 
On August 19, 2016, the Company assigned to Nexfuels the following:
 
1. | The idea, concept and plan to capture and sell CO2 generated by the Dave Johnston power plant located in Converse County, Wyoming and/or any other power plants owned by PacifiCorp. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | The Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) by and between T-Rex and PacifiCorp Energy the owner/operator of the power plant. 
3. | The existing contract by and between Sargent Lundy LLC to perform the feasibility study. 
4. | Any and all other valid and subsisting contracts, agreement, and instruments, rights or other interest that the Company may have in the Project. 
5. | All valid and subsisting easements, permits, licenses, servitudes, rights of way and other surface rights that directly relate to or are otherwise directly applicable to the Project.

 
An analysis of the properties assigned to Nexfuels by the Company showed that the Company in accordance with its accounting policies had not capitalized any of the direct or indirect costs associated with the MOUs, the feasibility study or any of the other interests in the project. As such, the Company did not recognize a gain or loss in connection with the Nexfuels spin-off.

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
 


Part of our strategy includes the use of partnerships to not only own individual projects, but to handle the drilling, completion, operation and raising of capital for the funding of such prospects. The Company or one of its subsidiaries will then handle the operation and management of the partnership.
Terex Energy Corporation
 
Terex Energy Corporation (“Terex”) was incorporated in the State of Colorado in February 2014. Terex has interests in oil and gas properties.
 
On December 22, 2014, we entered into Exchange Agreements with the Terex shareholders for 100% of the shares of Terex. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreements, we agreed to issue 7,385,700 shares of our restricted common stock for 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Terex. The shares were exchanged on a one for one basis. As a result, Terex became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
The effective date of the acquisition was December 22, 2014, with T-Rex being the legal acquirer. However, since T-Rex is a public company, which had nominal activity, the acquisition was treated as a recapitalization of Terex. Though T-Rex was the legal acquirer in the acquisition, Terex was the accounting acquirer since its shareholders gained control of T-Rex. Therefore, at the date of the acquisition the historical financial statements of Terex became those of T-Rex. As a result, the historical financial statements of Terex supersede any prior financial statements of T-Rex.
 
Prior to the share exchange with T-Rex, Terex had acquired interests in oil and gas prospects and properties discussed herein. Terex also is an operator of oil and gas properties and as such operates the various properties owned by the Company and its subsidiaries.
 
Western Interior Oil & Gas Corporation.
 
Western Interior Oil & Gas Corporation (“Western Interior”) was incorporated in the State of Wyoming in August 2005. Western Interior has producing and developmental oil and gas properties in southwest central Wyoming.
 
On February 24, 2015, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Western Interior and the shareholders of Western Interior. Under the Share Exchange Agreement we exchanged shares of our common stock for 83% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Western Interior. The acquisition was closed on March 28, 2015 and was effective March 31, 2015. At the time of closing, we issued 7,465,168 shares of our restricted common stock in exchange for shares of Western Interior.
 
On March 31, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the Share Exchange Agreement whereby we assumed certain repurchase agreements between Western Interior and its dissident shareholders and as a result acquired the remaining 17% of Western Interior. As part of these agreements, we assumed certain promissory notes issued to the dissenting

-

shareholders in the total amount of $1,770,047 that are collateralized by Western Interior’s assets. As a result, Western Interior has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 JK Minerals, Inc.
 
In January 2016, we were assigned 100% of the equity interest issued and outstanding in JK Minerals, Inc. (“JK Minerals”) by its sole shareholder, Blue Tip Energy Wyoming, Inc. At the time of the assignment, JK Minerals had no outstanding liabilities and its only asset was a license to a 3-D Seismology Report performed in 2004 on the Cole Creek Property acquired by T-Rex #3. JK Minerals was incorporated in Wyoming in July 1991 and has no operations.
 
T-Rex Oil LLC #3
 
T-Rex Oil, LLC #3 (“T-Rex #3”) is a Colorado limited liability company organized in January 2016. T-Rex #3 is managed by the Company and T-Rex has a 16.67% equity interest in T-Rex #3 with the remaining 83.33% equity interest being owned by Mr. VanderPloeg who is a former director and shareholder of the Company. Per its Operating Agreement, T-Rex #3 acts and is the holder in title to any and all assets and any related liabilities as well as operations on behalf of the Company.
 
Therefore, in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for consolidation, as set forth in Topic 810-10-15 of the ASC, the Company has included in these consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2017 any such assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses of T-Rex #3.
 
T-Rex #3 owns 13,328 gross, 10,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming (the “Cole Creek Property”). Effective September 1, 2018, the Company sold its 100% working interest in the Cole Creek Property for $3,500,000 in cash.
 
T-Rex Oil LLC #1
 
T-Rex Oil LLC #1 (“T-Rex #1”) is a Colorado limited liability company organized in December 2014. Terex is the Manager of T-Rex #1 and is the operator of the Sioux County, Nebraska project and the Company has no equity interest in T-Rex #1.
 
The Company in December 2014 entered into put agreements with the members of T-Rex #1 whereby the Company granted a right to put the purchase of their interest of T-Rex #1 in the amount of $425,000 back to the Company at an exercise price of $2.00 per share or a total of 212,500 shares of the Company’s common stock. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, the Company issued to the members of LLC #1 a total of 425,000 shares of its restricted common stock at an exercise price of $1 per share valued at $425,000.
 Our Company
 
NOTE: This report is as of March 31, 2017. Subsequent to such date, due to the depressed oil prices, the business of the Company has been determined to be unsustainable due to lack of capital, and the Company is liquidating its assets and seeking a new business.
 
We are an independent oil and gas exploration and production company focused on the acquisition, enhancement and development of oil and gas assets primarily in the Rocky Mountain region of Wyoming. Based on a 2007 research study conducted by the Enhanced Oil Recovery Institute at the University of Wyoming using reservoir production data provided by the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (“WOGCC”), Wyoming has produced 7,024 million barrels of oil from 1,237 producing fields with the top 400 fields producing 97.7% of the total produced oil, or 6,865 million barrels of oil.
 
We believe that there remain several under-developed or mismanaged oil and gas properties in Wyoming that with proper field management, application of modern exploration and development techniques, enhanced recovery methods and in-field drilling will increase current production and the ultimate recovery factor of oil and gas reserves from these fields. In addition, while we are focusing on the acquisition of proven properties that we believe can be economically enhanced in this current commodity price environment, in certain market conditions, we believe there could be

-

additional upside realized through the development of deeper productive horizons, or applying tertiary recovery applications to these acquired fields.
 
To date, we have focused our activities in Eastern Wyoming along the Salt Creek/Big Muddy trend. Starting with the Salt Creek field in Natrona County, following the Salt Creek/Big Muddy trend down to the South Glenrock field in Converse County, we believe there are a series of analogous fields that could provide ideal targets for us to execute this business strategy. The following fields are located along this trend, which we refer to as the “String of Pearls”.
 

Field | Operators (1) | County 
---------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------
Salt Creek | FDL Operating Fossil Energy Chapman | Natrona County 
Teapot Naval Reserve (aka Teapot Dome) | Natrona County Holdings | Natrona County 
Sage Spring Creek | Black Bear Oil Corporation Matrix Production Company Strachen Exploration Company | Natrona/Converse County
Burke Ranch | Griffiths Oil LLC Terex Energy Corporation (2) | Natrona County 
Cole Creek | Blue Tip Energy (3) Linc Energy Petroleum WYO | Natrona/Converse County
Cole Creek South | Blue Tip Energy (3) Linc Energy Petroleum WYO | Converse County 
Big Muddy | Vortex Petroleum Bass Petroleum Linc Energy Petroleum WYO | Converse County 
Big Muddy East | Linc Energy Petroleum WYO | Converse County 
Glenrock South | Linc Energy Petroleum WYO Muddy Mineral Exploration | Converse County 
Glenrock | Linc Energy Petroleum WYO | Converse County 


(1) | During the year ended December 31, 2015, as identified by the WOGCC website. 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | Terex Energy Corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of T-Rex Oil, Inc. 
(3) | In January 2016, T-Rex #3, an equity investment, acquired an 82% working interest in the Blue Tip Energy Properties in Cole Creek and Cole Creek South. In April 2016, T-Rex #3 acquired the remaining 18% working interest in the Blue Tip Energy Properties in Cole Creek and South Creek. T-Rex #3 holds 100% working interest in these properties.

 
According to the WOGCC, these fields range in size, but generally produce from similar stacked horizons ranging from the Deep Tensleep to the Wall/Creek/Frontier formations.
 
We acquired our first assets in 2014 and currently operate wells and properties in the Burke Ranch and Cole Creek Fields. We have identified areas of enhancements available to increase the production and recovery factors of these fields, including well recompletion, stimulation activities, pressure maintenance improvement, down spacing and

-

enhanced recovery. We believe that several other fields in the area provide evidence of the potential of these operated assets given similar geology and productive horizons. For instance, the Salt Creek field has achieved a nearly 40% recovery factor, developed down to 20 acre spacing utilizing a C02 (Carbon Dioxide) flood. The Cole Creek field by contrast has achieved a modest 23% recovery factor, based on 80 acre well development. We have identified several behind pipe recompletion opportunities targeting undeveloped productive formations that are currently producing in the Salt Creek field.
 
As a result, we believe that there remains significant work to be completed in our currently operated fields that match our business strategy, while we continue to seek opportunity to acquire additional assets along this trend.
 
Our Properties
 
We are initially focused on the Salt Creek/Big Muddy trend in the State of Wyoming. This trend covers approximately 8 miles running from Natrona County in the north down to Converse County in the south.
 
We were attracted to this area based upon the available information of hydrocarbon production, including primary, secondary and in some cases tertiary recovery results. While the size and recovery factors associated with the various fields within the area vary, the general geologic setting is considered to be consistent. We identify the Salt Creek field, which has achieved a 40% recovery factor, as an indicator of the potential of these fields that are less developed at this point in time.
 
Cole Creek Oil Field, Wyoming
 
Located in the southwest margin of the Powder River Basin in Natrona and Converse Counties, approximately 20 miles to the northeast of Casper, Wyoming. Our Leasehold historically produces from 4 Cretacious sand formations, the Shannon, the Frontier, the Dakota and the Lakota. Additionally, there is potential in the Muddy and the Tensleep or Minnelusa formations. We are currently reprocessing and reinterpreting Seismic data previously performed on parts of the property.
 
Production in the field at this time is from the 2nd Frontier and the Dakota and averages 60 BOPD. We have identified several behind pipe opportunities and plan to develop them in the near term.
 
Covering approximately 13,400 gross acres and 19 producing wells and 23 existing well bores.
 
We intend to focus on the re-development of the Shannon and Frontier formation using new technology and 3-D seismic re-work methods. We intend to drill edge and infill wells initially then develop the property for tertiary recovery using polymer floods, surfactants and possibly CO2 injection.
 
Burke Ranch Project, Natrona County, Wyoming
 
The Burke Ranch Field of Wyoming consists of approximately 4,500 acres located in the southwest corner of the Powder River Basin. The project has a potential for 40+ development and exploratory wells. Historically, the Dakota Formation has been the primary objective. The Burke Ranch Unit was originally developed on 80 acre spacing. Downsizing the spacing to 40 acres and drilling infill and edge wells offers low risk and high potential production.
 
We are currently permitting a small 3 D seismic project on our acreage to enable us to better define the best development opportunities. There could be additional potential in the Frontier (Wall Creek), Second Frontier, Niobrara, Mowry, and Tensleep Formations.
 
Burke Ranch Field offers a variety of drilling and development opportunities.
 

● | Tensleep Formation - new drilling on seismic anomaly 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Dakota Formation – additional development of the Dakota Formation to re-work the field to increase existing production

-


● | Frontier Formation - to recomplete the existing wells to access existing reserves behind pipe. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Big Horn Basin Prospect
 
The Big Horn Basin, located in north-central Wyoming, is a geological structural basin of sedimentary rocks dating from the Cambrian to Miocene. The principal productive reservoir of oil in the Big Horn Basin to date has been the Pennsylvanian Tensleep Formation. Other producing horizons include the Mississippian Madison Limestone, Permian Phosphoria and the Cretaceous Frontier Sandstone.
 
Our Big Horn Basin projects currently produce from the Triassic Crow Mountain, Permian Phosphoria and Frontier formations. They provide us with both development and exploration opportunities.
 
The Big Horn Basin Prospect properties have a combination of development and exploration projects. We expect to drill, subject to reasonable financing, between 16 and 36 wells on the properties over the next two years.
 
Rawhide - This is an opportunity for development of existing production and exploration for deeper reserves. Cumulative historical production to date is approximately 147.0 MBO.
 
Meeteetse “Deep” - This is an opportunity to develop a large Phosphoria-Tensleep oil field. This is the largest project in the Western Interior portfolio. In mid-2008, the Carter 1 discovery well was re-entered and recompleted in the Phosphoria formation to restore production. Extensive testing and analysis have established Phosphoria 2P reserves on the 240 acre lease block.
Baird Peak - Baird Peak is a well-defined structure with 200’ of closure, with multiple pay objectives. Historically, it has produced 128,000 BO.
 
Nebraska
 
Sioux and Kimball County, Nebraska
 
We have development of the project through T-Rex #1. The project consists of:
 

● | We have a 100% WI and a 75% NRI in the well and key acreage of 240 acres. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We have sufficient acreage to drill two new wells in an up-dip direction structurally. 
● | The Company has a 31.25% WI until payout, at which time the Company would get an additional 25% working interest for a total of 56.25% in a water injection-disposal project.
● | Water injection well application for permit was submitted and in early April 2015 it was approved for injection rates of 5,000 barrels of water per day, pending appeal. 
● | Water injection well has been drilled and cased with 7 inch pipe. 

NOTE : THESE NEBRASKA PROPERTIES WERE ALL SOLD TO OPEN RANGE, LLC IN JUNE 2017.
 
Drilling Program and Field Activities
 
We initiated our operations in Wyoming with the acquisition of the acreage in the Burke Ranch in 2014. Since closing the Cole Creek acquisition, we have focused the majority of our activities in this field and developing a recompletion program and 3D Seismic reprocessing and interpretation program.

-

We believe there remain a number of activities to complete in the field, including further re-completions, down-spaced drilling and enhanced oil recovery techniques which will most likely start with CO2 “huff and puff” treatments.
 
Asset Impairment Analysis – March 31, 2017
 The Company as of March 31, 2017 reviewed its assets including long-term assets under ASC Topic 360 and concluded the following realizations.
 Property and Equipment – Oil and Gas:
 Cole Creek Properties
 The Company based upon an analysis of its Cole Creek properties and the realization of the eventual disposition of these properties in October 2018 in the amount of $3,500,000 in cash determined that the carrying amount of $80,145 did not require impairment.
Other Properties
 The Company, based upon an analysis of its other oil and gas properties and that there was no realization of expected undiscounted future net cash flows from these assets, determined that the carrying amount of $307,948 [net of accumulated DDD&A and asset retirement obligations] be totally impaired as of March 31, 2017.
 Investment in T-Rex Oil LLC #1 – Effective August 18, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding membership interest in T-Rex Oil LLC #1, a Colorado limited liability company (“LLC #1”) as part of a put agreement with the members of LLC #1, and recorded the investment in LLC #1 at $425,000 as per the put agreement. Thus, due to the significance of this event, the investment was tested under ASC 360 as to its recoverability and recorded at fair value if impairment was required under the accounting guidance. The Company used Level 3 inputs and after reviewing the assets of LLC #1, there was no recoverability in the Company’s investment. As such, there was an impairment of $425,000 during the year ended March 31, 2017.
 Business Strategies
 
Our objective is to create shareholder value by identifying and assembling a portfolio of low-risk assets with attractive economic profiles and leveraging our technical and managerial expertise to deliver industry-leading results. We seek to achieve this objective by executing the following strategies:

● | Pursue Out of Favor Fields. We believe that many of our peers are currently looking to exit Wyoming to pursue other areas of operations. We attribute this trend to either the smaller size of their respective holdings, the fact that the majority of these assets represent conventional oil and/or natural gas production or the possibility that they currently lack the resources to focus on the best management of these assets. By contrast, given our management experience in this area, we seek to aggregate these assets, to achieve economies of scale, driving down our per unit operating costs, while increasing production by detailed field management and enhancement.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Seek Held by Production Acreage that Can Provide Future Upside. Our acquisition strategy is based on identifying and acquiring producing properties that we believe can be enhanced. However, given our experience in Wyoming, we anticipate that there will be further upside achieved if commodity prices improve through the exploration of deeper productive horizons. While we do not quantify this upside value, we seek acquisitions where we can secure this upside optionality while executing our core business strategy. 

Competitive Strengths
 
We possess a number of competitive strengths that we believe will allow us to successfully execute our business strategies:
 

9
-


● | Management Experience. Our management has a total combined experience of 100+ years in the oil and gas industry with a particular focus on Wyoming. We believe that this firsthand knowledge of our management, which includes having drilled numerous wells in Wyoming, and our ownership of acres of surface land, provide us with a competitive advantage when executing our acquisition strategy, in addition to our planned field enhancement operations. As a result of this experience, we believe that we will be able to produce our fields in Wyoming much more efficiently than many of our peers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Multi-Year, Low-Risk Development Drilling Inventory. We have identified a number of field enhancements that could be conducted across our current asset base including 7 initial recompletions, the development of 61 PUD drilling locations (56 in Cole Creek and 5 in the Big Horn Basin) and additional locations should we determine to down-space to 40 acre well spacing. Likewise, we believe there are 18 to 20 behind pipe zones that provide us with additional reserves. 
● | Proven Acquisition Strategy. Given the experience of our management team, we have been successful in identifying and closing on acquisitions within the Salt Creek/Big Muddy trend that fit our business strategy. This firsthand knowledge provides us with insight into possible asset transactions before many of our peers are aware of them. Coupled with our knowledge related to the geologic and operational setting of these assets, we believe we have a strong advantage in determining the price to pay for these potential acquisitions, while also having a clear understanding of how to enhance value prior to closing the transaction.

COMPETITION, MARKETS, REGULATION AND TAXATION
 
Competition
 
There are a large number of companies and individuals engaged in the exploration for oil and gas; accordingly, there is a high degree of competition for desirable properties. However, the staff at T-Rex is experienced and knowledgeable about the Rocky Mountain region and can evaluate potential acquisitions and opportunities with greater efficiency.
Markets
 
The availability of a ready market for newly discovered oil and gas reserves will depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the proximity and capacity of refineries and pipelines, the effect of state regulation of production and of federal regulation of products sold in interstate commerce and recent intrastate sales. The market price of oil and gas is volatile and beyond our control.
Global Oil Supply
 
In the last two years, the produced global oil supply is outpacing oil demand which, in part, has resulted in declining oil prices. It is only in the last several months that production has come into line with demand and pricing has seen a relatively stable period, though prices have not rebound to pre-2014 levels.
 
Despite this, the industry continues to work on a production decline curve, and the industry continues to focus on trying to replace depleting reserves with more conventional and cost effective production techniques.
 
Effect of Changing Industry Conditions on Drilling Activity
 
Lower oil and gas prices have caused a decline in drilling activity in the U.S. recently. However, such reduced activity will normally result in a decline in drilling, lease acquisition and equipment costs, and an improvement in the terms under which drilling prospects are generally available. We cannot predict what oil and gas prices will be in the future and what effect those prices may have on drilling activity in general, or on our ability to generate economic drilling prospects or to raise the necessary funds with which to drill them.
Effect of Technology 
 
Evolving scientific and technological developments in the last five years have not only provided access to previously unreachable and large reserves, but in many cases have made the production of such reserves highly profitable. In addition, these developments have taken previously shut in fields/wells and made them once again economically viable and in some cases, greatly so.

Government Regulations
 
Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that change from time to time. Many of these regulations are intended to prevent pollution and protect environmental quality, including regulations related to permit requirements for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling, completing and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, groundwater testing, air emissions, noise, lighting and traffic abatement and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Other regulations are intended to prevent the waste of oil and gas and to protect the rights among owners in a common reservoir. These include regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number, or density, of wells which may be drilled in an area, the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas wells and regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and that impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells. In addition, our operations are subject to regulations governing the pipeline gathering and transportation of oil and natural gas, as well as various federal, state and local tax laws and regulations.
 
Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are generally subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Although we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance.
 
Regulation of Production
 
Federal, state and local agencies have promulgated extensive rules and regulations applicable to our oil and natural gas exploration, production and related operations. Most states require drilling permits, drilling and operating bonds and the filing of various reports and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters including provisions governing the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the density of wells and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states like Wyoming and Colorado allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely primarily or exclusively on the voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In areas with voluntary pooling, it may be more difficult to develop a project if the operator owns less than 100% of the leasehold. The statutes and regulations of some states limit the rate at which oil and gas is produced from properties, prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production. This may limit the amount of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or locations at which we can drill. The federal and state regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability. Because these rules and regulations are amended or reinterpreted frequently, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with these laws.
 
The Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission is the primary regulator of exploration and production of oil and gas resources in the principal area in which we operate. The WOGCC regulates oil and gas operators through rules, policies, written guidance, orders, permits and inspections. Among other criteria, the WOGCC enforces specifications regarding drilling, development, production, abandonment, enhanced recovery, safety, aesthetics, noise, waste, flowlines and wildlife.
 
Regulation of sales and transportation of natural gas
 
Historically, the transportation and sales for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulations. Effective January 1, 1993, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act deregulated the price for all “first sales” of natural gas. Thus, all of our sales of gas may be made at market prices, subject to applicable contract provisions. Sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of pipeline transportation. Since 1985, the FERC has implemented regulations intended to make natural gas transportation more accessible to gas buyers and sellers on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. We cannot predict what further action the FERC will take on these matters. Some of the FERC’s more recent proposals may, however, adversely affect the
  
11
--

availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines. We do not believe that we will be affected by any action taken materially differently than other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete.
 
Regulation of sales and transportation of oil
 
Our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. Interstate transportation of oil by pipeline is regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on oil pipelines, including interstate pipelines that transport crude oil and refined products (collectively referred to as “petroleum pipelines”) be just and reasonable and non-discriminatory and that such rates and terms and conditions of service be filed with the FERC.
 
Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we do not believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will affect our operations in any way that is materially different than those of our competitors who are similarly situated.
 
Environmental Laws.
 
Oil and gas exploration and development are specifically subject to existing federal and state laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing oil and gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation.
 
All of our operations involving the exploration for or the production of any minerals are subject to existing laws and regulations relating to exploration procedures, safety precautions, employee health and safety, air quality standards, pollution of stream and fresh water sources, odor, noise, dust and other environmental protection controls adopted by federal, state and local governmental authorities as well as the right of adjoining property owners. We may be required to prepare and present to federal, state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of minerals may have upon the environment. All requirements imposed by any such authorities may be costly and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations.
 
It may be anticipated that future legislation will significantly emphasize the protection of the environment, and that, as a consequence, our activities may be more closely regulated to further the cause of environmental protection. Such legislation, as well as future interpretation of existing laws, may require substantial increases in equipment and operating costs to us and delays, interruptions or a termination of operations, the extent of which cannot now be predicted.
 
Title to Properties.
 
We are not the record owner of our interest in our properties and rely instead on contracts with the owner or operator of the property, pursuant to which, among other things, we have the right to have our interest placed of record. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, a preliminary title examination generally will be conducted prior to the time unproved properties or interests are acquired by us. Prior to commencement of drilling operations on such acreage and prior to the acquisition of proved properties, we usually will conduct a thorough title examination and will remedy any significant defects before proceeding with operations or the acquisition of proved properties, as we may deem appropriate.
 
Our properties are subject to royalty, overriding royalty and other interests customary in the industry, liens incident to agreements, current taxes and other burdens, minor encumbrances, easements and restrictions. Although we are not aware of any material title defects or disputes with respect to our undeveloped acreage, to the extent such defects or disputes exist, we would suffer title failures.
