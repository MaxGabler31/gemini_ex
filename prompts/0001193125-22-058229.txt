General 
 Trex Company, Inc. (Company, we, us or our), was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1998. The Company is the world’s largest manufacturer of composite decking and railing products, which are marketed under the brand name Trex® and manufactured in the United States. In addition, Trex is a leading national provider of custom-engineered railing and staging systems for the commercial and multi-family market, including sports stadiums and performing arts venues. Our principal executive offices are located at 160 Exeter Drive, Winchester, Virginia 22603, and our telephone number at that address is (540) 542-6300.Products 
 Operations and Products: The Company currently operates in two reportable segments: Trex Residential Products (Trex Residential), the Company’s principal business based on net sales, and Trex Commercial Products (Trex Commercial). 
 Trex Residential is the world’s largest manufacturer of high-performance, low-maintenance wood-alternative composite decking and railing, with 30 years of product experience. Trex outdoor living products are marketed under the brand name Trex® and manufactured in the United States. Stocked in more than 6,700 retail locations worldwide, we offer a comprehensive set of aesthetically appealing and durable, low-maintenance product offerings in the decking, railing, fencing, and outdoor lighting categories. A majority of the products are eco-friendly and leverage recycled and reclaimed materials to the extent possible. Trex Residential decking is made in a proprietary process that combines reclaimed wood fibers and recycled polyethylene film, making Trex one of the largest recyclers of waste polyethylene plastic film in North America. Trex Residential products are sold to distributors and home centers for final resale primarily to the residential market.

  Trex offers the following products through Trex Residential: 
 

Decking and Accessories | Our principal decking products are Trex Transcend®, Trex Select®, and Trex Enhance®. In addition, our Trex Transcend decking product can also be used as cladding. Our high-performance, low-maintenance, eco-friendly composite decking products are comprised of a blend of 95 percent reclaimed wood fibers and recycled polyethylene film and feature a protective polymer shell for enhanced protection against fading, staining, mold and scratching. We also offer accessories to our decking products, including Trex Hideaway® and Trex DeckLighting™, an outdoor lighting system. Trex DeckLighting is a line of energy-efficient LED dimmable deck lighting, which is designed for use on posts, floors and steps. The line includes a post cap light, deck rail light, riser light and a recessed deck light. 
Railing | Our railing products are Trex Transcend Railing, Trex Select Railing, Trex Enhance Railing and Trex Signature® aluminum railing. Trex Transcend Railing, made from approximately 40 percent recycled content, is available in the colors of Trex Transcend decking and finishes that make it appropriate for use with Trex decking products as well as other decking materials, which we believe enhances the sales prospects of our railing products. Trex Select Railing, made from approximately 40 percent recycled content, is offered in a white finish and is ideal for consumers who desire a simple clean finished look for their deck. Trex Enhance, made from approximately 40 percent recycled content, is available in three colors and is offered through home improvement retailers in kits that contain the complete railing system. Trex Signature aluminum railing, made from a minimum of 40 percent recycled content, is available in three colors and designed for consumers who want a sleek, contemporary look.
Fencing | Our Trex Seclusions® fencing product is offered through two specialty distributors. This product consists of structural posts, bottom rail, pickets, top rail and decorative post caps. 


Trex Residential products offer a number of significant aesthetic advantages over wood while eliminating many of wood’s major functional disadvantages, which include warping, splitting and other damage from moisture. In addition to resisting fading and surface staining, Trex Residential products require no sanding, staining or sealing, resist moisture damage, provide a splinter-free surface and do not require chemical treatment against rot or insect infestation. Special characteristics (including resistance to splitting, the ability to bend, and ease and consistency of machining and finishing) facilitate installation, reduce contractor call-backs and afford consumers a wide range of design options. Combined, these aspects yield significant aesthetic advantages and lower maintenance than wood decking and railing and ultimately render Trex Residential products less costly than wood over the life of the deck. 
 We have received product building code listings from the major U.S. building code listing agencies for decking and railing and from the major Canadian building code listing agency for decking. The listings facilitate the acquisition of building permits by deck builders and promote consumer and industry acceptance of our products as an alternative to wood decking.

Customers and Distribution 
 Trex Residential: Wholesale Distributors/Retail Lumber Dealers. We generate most of our sales for our composite decking and railing products through our wholesale distribution network by selling Trex Residential products to wholesale distributors, who in turn, sell our products to retail lumber outlets. These retail dealers market to both homeowners and contractors, but they emphasize sales to professional contractors, remodelers and homebuilders. Contractor-installed decks generally are larger installations with professional craftsmanship. Our retail dealers generally provide sales personnel trained in Trex Residential products, contractor training, inventory commitment and point-of-sale display support. We believe that attracting wholesale distributors, who are committed to our products and marketing approach and can effectively sell higher value products to contractor-oriented lumber yards and other retail outlets, is important to our future growth. Our distributors provide value-added service in marketing our products because they sell premium wood decking products and other innovative building materials that typically require product training and personal selling efforts. We typically appoint two distributors within a specified area to sell only Trex Residential decking products on an exclusive basis. The distributor purchases our products at prices in effect at the time we ship the product to the distributor. 
 Home Depot and Lowe’s. We sell our products through Home Depot and Lowe’s stores. Home Depot and Lowe’s purchase products directly from us for stocking on their shelves. They also purchase product through our wholesale distributors for special orders placed by consumers. Home Depot and Lowe’s serve both the contractor market and the “do-it-yourself” market. We believe that brand exposure through Home Depot and Lowe’s promotes consumer acceptance of our products.

  In the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 sales to certain customers of Trex Residential accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s total net sales. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 three customers of Trex Residential represented approximately 61%, 56%, and 57%, respectively, of the Company’s total net sales. 
 Trex Commercial: We sell our modular and architectural railing and staging systems to the commercial and multifamily market, including sports stadiums and performing arts venues, primarily to facility owners and general contractors throughout the country. We market these products through our direct sales staff, independent sales representatives, and bidding on projects. 
 We are committed to conducting business activities with the highest standards of business ethics and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. Our Vendor and Customer Code of Conduct and Ethics (Code), available at www.trex.com/our-company, applies to all parties providing goods and services to the Company, and all channel partners who distribute, sell and/or install our products (collectively, Business Partners). We expect all Business Partners, and all employees, agents and subcontractors to follow our high ethical standards set forth in the Code while they are conducting business with us or on our behalf. In addition, we expect our Business Partners to understand and comply with the Trex Company Code of Conduct and Ethics, available at www.trex.com/our-company, to do business with Business Partners who share the same commitment to human rights that we have and as set forth in our Human Rights Policy, available at www.trex.com/our-company. 
 Manufacturing Process 
 Products manufactured at our Trex Residential manufacturing facilities in Virginia and Nevada are primarily manufactured from reclaimed wood fiber and scrap polyethylene. Our primary manufacturing process for the products involves mixing wood particles with plastic, heating and then extruding, or forcing, the highly viscous and abrasive material through a profile die. We use many proprietary and skill-based advantages in our eco-friendly manufacturing process. Products manufactured at our Trex Commercial manufacturing facility in Minnesota are primarily manufactured from aluminum and stainless steel. Our primary manufacturing process for these products involves cutting, machining, welding and finishing. We use Six Sigma and Lean Manufacturing methodologies throughout our Company within our plant operations and in the planning and execution of certain projects. 
 Our manufacturing processes require significant capital investment, expertise and time to develop. We have continuously invested the capital necessary to expand our manufacturing throughput and improve our manufacturing processes. In June 2019, we announced a capital expenditure program to increase production capacity at our Trex Residential facilities in Virginia and Nevada. The program involved the construction of a new decking facility at the existing Virginia site and the installation of additional production lines at the Nevada site. The investment allowed us to increase production output for future projected growth related to our strategy of converting wood demand to Trex Residential wood-alternative composite decking. Our capacity expansion program increased our Trex Residential production capacity by approximately 70 percent when compared to 2019 volume levels. In addition to the recently completed the capacity expansion at our Virginia and Nevada facilities, our engineering team has installed incremental decking lines within our new Virginia facility that further expanded our production capability. 
 On October 26, 2021, we announced plans to add a third U.S.-based Trex Residential manufacturing facility in Little Rock, Arkansas. The new campus will sit on approximately 300 acres of land and will address increased demand for Trex Residential outdoor living products. Construction is slated to begin in early 2022 with the first production output anticipated in 2024. Funded primarily through ongoing cash generation, we expect to invest approximately $400 million over the next five years in the development of the new Arkansas site. Over time, we expect to create more than 500 new jobs to the Little Rock area. We will continue our recruiting efforts to staff the facility in 2022.

   In addition, we prioritize cost reduction projects and continuous improvement opportunities, primarily related to automation, modernization, energy efficiency and raw material processing, and remain focused on innovation and new product development. We have also broadened the range of raw materials that we can use to produce a consistent and high-quality finished product. In connection with national building code listings, we maintain a quality control testing program. 
 Suppliers 
 We conduct supply chain assessments when considered necessary in relation to the significance of the purchase and business opportunity for the Company. Assessments include in-person reviews and tours of operating facilities. The Company is committed to conducting business activities with the highest standards of business ethics and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. As stated above, our Vendor and Customer Code of Conduct and Ethics, our Company Code of Conduct and Ethics, and our Human Rights Policy apply to all suppliers of the Company. 
 The production of most of our decking products requires a supply of reclaimed wood fiber and scrap polyethylene. We fulfill requirements for raw materials under both purchase orders and supply contracts. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we purchased our reclaimed wood fiber requirements under purchase orders and long-term supply commitments not exceeding four years. All of our polyethylene purchases are under short-term supply contracts that generally have a term of approximately one to two years for which pricing is negotiated as needed, or under purchase orders that do not involve long-term supply commitments. 
 

• | Reclaimed Wood Fiber: Cabinet and flooring manufacturers are our preferred suppliers of reclaimed wood fiber because the reclaimed wood fiber produced by these operations contains little contamination and is low in moisture. These facilities generate reclaimed wood fiber as a byproduct of their manufacturing operations. In addition, we purchase scrap select wood chips generated from various farming operations. If the reclaimed wood fiber meets our specifications, our reclaimed wood fiber supply agreements generally require us to purchase at least a specified minimum and at most a specified maximum amount of reclaimed wood fiber. Depending on our needs, the amount of reclaimed wood fiber that we actually purchase within the specified range under any supply agreement may vary significantly from year to year.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scrap Polyethylene: The polyethylene we consume is primarily composed of scrap plastic film and plastic bags. We will continue to seek to meet our future needs for scrap polyethylene from the expansion of our existing supply sources and the development of new sources. We believe our use of multiple sources provides us with a cost advantage and facilitates an environmentally responsible approach to our procurement of polyethylene. Our ability to source and use a wide variety of polyethylene from third party distribution and manufacturing operations is important to our cost strategy. We maintain this ability through the continued expansion of our plastic reprocessing operations in combination with the advancement of our proprietary material preparation and extrusion processes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In addition, we outsource the production of certain products to third-party manufacturers. 
 The production of our commercial products requires a supply of aluminum, stainless steel and glass components. We use multiple sources for each material to ensure consistent availability of material and competitive pricing. We purchase substantially all of our aluminum, stainless steel and glass under purchase orders, which do not involve long-term supply commitments. 
 Training 
 Trex University is our state-of-the-art training facility located near our Virginia manufacturing plant designed to educate and train retailers, contractors and other partners on the benefits of Trex Residential aesthetically pleasing, high-performance, low-maintenance, eco-friendly outdoor living products.

  Growth Strategies 
 Our long-term goals are to continue leading the category with beautiful, high-performance, low-maintenance Trex products, including our outdoor living products, such as composite decking and railing for the residential market and custom-engineered railing systems for the commercial market. To do this, we will increase market share and expand into new product categories and geographic markets through the design, creation and marketing of outdoor living products that offer superior aesthetics and quality and by expanding our sales to the commercial market. Trex Residential will expand its offering of eco-friendly decking and railing products for a breadth of audiences, whether by converting wood buyers who have not previously considered composite decking or appealing to the most discriminating high-end homeowners seeking superior aesthetics and quality. Trex Commercial will extend its position as a leading national provider of custom-engineered railing for the commercial and multi-family market, including sports stadiums. Additionally, Trex will continue to explore opportunities that leverage our manufacturing and extrusion expertise and recycling heritage. We intend to employ the following long-term strategies to achieve our goals: 

• | Innovation: Introduce new products that address unmet consumer and trade professional needs. Provide a compelling value proposition through ease of installation, low maintenance, long-term durability and superior aesthetics.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Brand: Expand awareness, preference and commitment for the Trex brand with both consumers and trade professionals. Deliver on the brand’s promise of superior quality, functionality, pleasing aesthetics and overall performance in outdoor living products and custom-engineered railing systems. Leverage omnichannel efforts to extend the Trex brand presence, both nationally and globally.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Channels: Achieve comprehensive market segment and geographic coverage for Trex products by increasing the number of stocking dealers and retailers and expanding our international presence for our eco-friendly wood-alternative outdoor living products, thereby making our products available wherever our customers choose to purchase their decking or railing , and by continuing to develop our commercial market penetration for our railing systems.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Quality: Continuously advance the quality of all operational and business processes, with the goal of achieving superior product quality and service levels, thereby giving us a sustainable competitive advantage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cost: Through capital investments and process engineering, continuously seek to lower the cost to manufacture Trex residential and commercial products. Investments in polyethylene recycling capabilities will allow us to expand our ability to use a wider breadth of waste materials thereby lowering raw material costs of our outdoor living products. We plan to continue to achieve significant improvements in manufacturing productivity by reducing waste and improving our production process.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer Service: Through our commitment to superior customer service, continually deliver consistently outstanding, personalized service to all customers and prospects in all segments.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition 
 Our primary competition for our composite decking and residential railing products consists of wood products, which constitute a substantial majority of decking and railing sales, as measured by linear feet of lumber. Many of the conventional lumber suppliers with which we compete have established ties to the building and construction industry and have well-accepted products. A majority of the lumber used in wood decks is pressure-treated lumber. Southern yellow pine and fir have a porosity that readily allows the chemicals used in the pressure treating process to be absorbed. The same porosity makes southern yellow pine susceptible to absorbing moisture, which causes the lumber to warp, crack, splinter and expel fasteners. In addition to pine and fir, other segments of wood material for decking include redwood, cedar and tropical hardwoods, such as ipe, teak and mahogany. These products are often significantly more expensive than pressure-treated lumber, but do not eliminate some of the disadvantages of other wood products. 
 
7 

  In addition to wood, we also compete with other manufacturers of wood-alternative products. Industry studies indicate that we have the leading market share of the wood-alternative segment of the decking and railing market. Our principal competitors include The Azek Company Inc., and Fiberon (a division of Fortune Brands, Inc.). 
 Our ability to compete depends, in part, on a number of factors outside our control, including the ability of our competitors to develop new wood-alternative decking and railing products that are competitive with our products. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the decking and railing market include product quality, price, aesthetics, maintenance cost, and distribution and brand strength. We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors. We believe that our products offer aesthetic and cost advantages over the life of a deck when compared to other types of decking and railing materials. Although a contractor-installed deck built with Trex products using a pressure-treated wood substructure generally costs more than a deck made entirely from pressure-treated wood, Trex products are low maintenance compared to the on-going maintenance required for a pressure-treated deck and are, therefore, less costly over the life of the deck. We believe that our manufacturing process and utilization of relatively low-cost raw material sources provide us with a competitive cost advantage relative to other manufacturers of wood-alternative decking and railing products. The scale of our operations also confers cost efficiencies in manufacturing, sales and marketing. 
 Our primary competition for our products in the commercial and multi-family market consists of companies that provide components to assemble guard rails, including C.R. Laurence Co., Inc., a CRH Group company, regional railing and metal fabricators, and Wenger Corporation. Our ability to compete depends on our product design advantages, relationships with architects and general contractors, and competitive manufacturing costs. We believe we have a competitive advantage in products and markets in which we have established a leading market share versus our competition, including the stadium and arena railing market. We do not yet experience those favorable dynamics in markets in which we are a relatively new entrant, including the aluminum balcony market. These dynamics derive from familiarity with project and customer requirements, technical product requirements, and contractor and architect relationships. 
 Seasonality 
 Our operating results for Trex Residential have historically varied from quarter to quarter. Seasonal, erratic or prolonged adverse weather conditions in certain geographic regions reduce the level of home improvement and construction activity and can shift demand for its products to a later period. As part of its normal business practice and consistent with industry practice, Trex Residential Products has historically offered incentive programs to its distributors and dealers to build inventory levels before the start of the prime deck-building season in order to ensure adequate availability of its product to meet anticipated seasonal consumer demand. The seasonal effects are often offset by the positive effect of the incentive programs. The operating results for Trex Commercial have not historically varied from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality. However, they are driven by the timing of individual projects, which may vary significantly each period. 
Government Regulation 
 Our business activities are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations. Costs and accruals incurred to comply with these governmental regulations are presently not material to our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future government laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position, we do not currently anticipate material expenditures for government regulations. 
 We are also subject to federal, state and local environmental regulation. The emissions of particulates and other substances from our manufacturing facilities must meet federal and state air quality standards implemented through air permits issued to us by the Department of Environmental Quality of the Commonwealth of Virginia, 
 
8 

  and the Division of Environmental Protection of Nevada’s Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. Our facilities are regulated by federal and state laws governing the disposal of solid waste and by state and local permits and requirements with respect to wastewater and storm water discharge. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. 
 Our operations also are subject to workplace safety regulation by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the States of Nevada, and Minnesota. Our compliance efforts include safety awareness and training programs for our production and maintenance employees. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights relating to our products, production processes and other operations. We rely upon a combination of trade secret, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, copyright and trademark laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We have made substantial investments in manufacturing process improvements that have enabled us to increase manufacturing line production rates, facilitate our development of new products, and produce improvements in our existing products’ dimensional consistency, surface texture and color uniformity. 
 Intellectual property rights may be challenged by third parties and may not exclude competitors from using the same or similar technologies, brands or works. We seek to secure effective rights for our intellectual property but cannot provide assurance that third parties will not successfully challenge, or avoid infringing, our intellectual property rights. 
 We consider our trademarks to be of material importance to our business plans. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has granted us federal registrations for many of our trademarks. Federal registration of trademarks is effective for as long as we continue to use the trademarks and renew their registrations. We do not generally register any of our copyrights with the U.S. Copyright Office but rely on the protection afforded to such copyrights by the U.S. Copyright Act. This law provides protection to authors of original works, whether published or unpublished, and whether registered or unregistered. 
 We hold a number of U.S. Patents and U.S. Patent Applications for various technologies. We have one current U.S. Patent for decking technology and four U.S. Patents for various staging systems, accessories and related technologies. We intend to maintain our existing patents in effect until they expire as well as to seek additional patents as we consider appropriate. 
 We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. If it is necessary to disclose proprietary information to third parties for business reasons, we require that such third parties sign a confidentiality agreement prior to any disclosure. 
 Human Capital 
 We are committed to furthering our stature as the highest quality, pre-eminent decking brand in the world, while delivering robust value to our shareholders. As we continue to grow, a differentiating factor continues to be the caliber of our talent. The Company embraces a culture of diverse thinking and perspectives. We strive for this by making human capital a key strategic pillar overseen by the Board of Directors and management. 
 Our focus is to attract, develop and retain a highly engaged and diverse workforce. We accomplish this through broad and transparent employment branding efforts, competitive and equitable compensation philosophies, proactive employee relations, and by offering a work environment with meaningful career growth opportunities.

  At December 31, 2021, Trex Residential employed 1,924 full-time employees and Trex Commercial employed 150 full-time employees. Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relationships with our employees are favorable, and we have not had any serious complaints or claims over the last three years. Our Human Rights Policy sets forth our values related to working conditions and human rights, and it underscores our philosophy about the way we conduct our business. The policy is available at www.trex.com/our-company.
We believe that diversity, equity and inclusion enriches our organization, contributes to our long-term value creation, and fosters an environment of creativity and innovative thinking, which will bring forth new ideas and challenge the status quo. The strategy we have developed aims to advance our efforts to increase the diversity of our workforce, while we continue to be a destination workplace for talent and maximize returns to our shareholders. 
 We believe the best candidate or employee is someone who is driven, bold, hard-working, determined and tenacious; embodies our overarching ideals and identity; and who looks, thinks or acts differently than the majority. These differences could be represented by race, ethnicity, gender, or academic and professional backgrounds. When comparing our ethnicity demographics against those in the geographies where we operate, we seek to accurately represent the diversity of our local communities and beyond. 
 We added approximately 400 employees during 2021 in support of our expansion efforts and growth at Trex Residential and expect to continue to add additional employees to support our growth. We continue to build our employer brand by accurately and transparently reflecting our work culture to attract candidates with actions that include, but are not limited to: 
 

• | Developing a recruiting campaign specifically for Spanish-speaking job seekers with supporting documents and training to continue to engage them once employed;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leveraging large, diverse recruiting platforms to reach broader audiences;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Trex has taken these steps to ensure all employees feel comfortable, and to ensure that we remain an employer of choice, well-known for both innovation and opportunity. All Trex employees have completed live diversity, equity and inclusion training facilitated by outside experts, which addresses valuing differences, communicating inclusively, avoiding harassment and hostile work environment, and resolving unconscious bias. In addition, we provide Code of Conduct and Ethics training to our employees. As part of our Employee Engagement Survey in 2021, we developed additional questions to help gauge the level of satisfaction with our approach and progress among our employees. Additionally, of the employees who completed the survey, 72% of those employees are defined as “engaged”, which is above the industry norm as well as a slight increase from our 2019 survey.

   Our recruitment strategy includes advanced education recruitment and veteran recruitment. We recognize the skills learned through these pursuits align with the skills necessary to be a successful employee, and our active involvement with these recruiting paths offers many opportunities to build partnerships and reach candidate pools at various career stages that are both diverse and geographically varied. The strategy also offers opportunities to partner with organizations that appeal to these talent groups, to increase our employer brand exposure, and to help sustain diversity and recruitment efforts. 
 As an equal opportunity employer, Trex is committed to providing fair and equitable pay for all employees across the Company. We strive to be an industry leader in terms of hourly wages, salary and total compensation. We use a compensation grade structure as part of our process to determine the appropriate grade level for each position at Trex. As a result, we set the pay range for each position before considering who we might hire to fill that role. In addition, we regularly review our compensation structures for signs of emerging inequities along gender or ethnicity lines as well as market competitiveness.

  Trex Residential’s eco-friendly composite decking products consist of a blend of 95 percent reclaimed wood and recycled polyethylene film. Trex diverts from landfills and upcycles over 350 million pounds of plastic film, bags and wraps each year. In addition, Trex Residential’s proprietary, eco-friendly processing method minimizes greenhouse gas emissions and our bi-coastal factories reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. We strive to reduce energy use and associated greenhouse gas emissions in Trex manufacturing operations by designing our facilities to run efficiently. In addition, almost 100 percent of our factory runoff and refuse are recycled back into the manufacturing line. Any product that does not meet quality specifications is reprocessed, which eliminates the need for landfill. In addition, it is Trex Commercial’s goal to provide eco-friendly products for the architectural railing market and promote an effort for design innovation that decreases the environmental footprint. 
 The Company’s primary resource usage consists of water, natural gas and electricity. The Company develops budgets and plans that improve shareholder return by ensuring the optimal use of each resource, which promotes resource efficiency and minimal waste of the resource. Water management is of critical importance to us. Our Virginia and Nevada manufacturing facilities have closed-loop recirculation systems that run water through multiple cycles of re-use before being returned to the municipal wastewater stream. We prioritize energy savings as part of our ongoing evaluation and optimization of business operations and manufacturing processes. We regularly assess environmental impacts at each stage of our manufacturing process and seek to continually improve our performance. We ensure that all manufacturing facilities meet emission standards for the locality in which they operate and certify to applicable authorities that our emissions are within the relevant locality’s standards. 
 Market Recognition of Trex Brand’s Environmental Characteristics 
 The Company’s internal standards for environmental stewardship and product integrity are recognized year-over-year in the marketplace. Trex was named to Fortune magazine’s 2020 list of the world’s 100 Fastest-Growing Companies and to Forbes’ 2021 List of America’s Best Mid-Size Companies – ranking #12 overall on the list of 100 companies. In 2021, Trex received Green Builder Media’s best Brand Index and the highest score for the decking category, Green Builder magazine’s Readers’ Choice Award for “Greenest Decking” – one of the most respected surveys issued by the publication – for an unprecedented 11-year streak, and Lifestory Research’s America’s Most Trusted® survey named Trex America’s Most Trusted Outdoor Decking Brand – receiving the only five-star rating in the decking category. 
 Trex environmental benefits are recognized by the receipt of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification by the United States Green Building Council. Trex Residential decking products meet LEED requirements for builders and our commercial products have contributed to the LEED certifications of some high-profile venues. LEED is a point-based system designed to reward points to building projects that incorporate efficient, and safe eco-friendly products, leading to a building’s designation as LEED Silver, Gold or Platinum. Trex Residential decking can add up to five points to a project — four points in the Materials and Resources category for being composed of 95% recycled and reclaimed materials, and one point in the Innovation and Design category. Trex Commercial railing products also typically contribute to LEED certification points in the Materials and Resources category based on recycled aluminum, steel, stainless steel and glass content. LEED buildings attract higher demand, premium rates and longer occupancy leases, thereby supporting continued and growing demand for products that can facilitate LEED designations. As a U.S. Green Building Council member, Trex works along with council members to transform the way buildings and communities are designed, built and operated with the goal of creating environmentally and socially responsible spaces that improve the quality of life.
