ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
We are a technology company that develops, sells and services interactive solutions predominantly for the global education market, but which are also sold into the health, government and corporate sectors. We are seeking to become a worldwide leading innovator and integrator of interactive products and software for schools, as well as for business and government learning spaces. We currently design, produce and distribute interactive technologies including flat panels, projectors, whiteboards and peripherals for the education market. We also distribute science, technology, engineering and math (or “STEM”) products, including our portable science lab. All products are integrated into our classroom software suite that provides tools for whole class learning, assessment and collaboration. To date, we have generated substantially all revenue in the U.S. from the sale of interactive displays and related software to the educational market. In the region encompassing Europe, the Middle East and Africa (collectively,” EMEA”), approximately 92% of our revenues relate to the education sector and the remainder comes from health, government and corporate including the banking and financial services sector.
In the education sector we provide educators with hardware, engineering and manufacturing, software and content development for use in the classroom. We provide comprehensive services to our clients and customers, including installation, training, consulting and maintenance. We seek to provide easy-to-use solutions combining interactive displays with robust software to enhance the educational environment, ease the teacher technology burden, and improve student outcomes. Our goal is to become a single source solution to satisfy the needs of educators around the globe and provide a holistic approach to the modern classroom. Our products are currently sold in approximately 60 countries and our software is available in 32 languages, helping children learn in over 850,000 classrooms. We sell our products and software through more than 500 global reseller partners. We believe we offer the most comprehensive and integrated line of interactive display solutions, audio products, peripherals and accessories for schools and enterprises. Our products are backed by nearly 30 years of research and development. We introduced the world’s first interactive projector in 2007 and obtained patents to the technology in 2010.
Advances in technology and new options for introduction into the classroom have forced school districts to look for solutions that allow teachers and students to bring their own devices into the classroom, provide school districts with information technology departments with the means to access data with or without internet access, handle the demand for video, as well as control cloud and data storage challenges. Our design teams are able to quickly customize systems and configurations to serve the needs of clients so that existing hardware and software platforms can communicate with one another. We have created plug-ins for annotative software that make existing and legacy hardware interactive and allows interactivity with or without wires through our MimioTeach product. Our goal is to become a single source solution to satisfy the needs of educators around the globe and provide a holistic approach to the modern classroom.
We pride ourselves in providing industry-leading service and support and have received numerous product awards:

The organizational structure of our companies is as follows:

Our Markets
The global education industry is undergoing a significant transition, as primary and secondary school districts, colleges and universities, as well as governments, corporations and individuals around the world are increasingly recognizing the importance of using technology to more effectively provide information to educate students and other users. In the United States, we are benefiting from the substantial government investments from the CAREs Act and the stimulus package. To a lesser extent we are seeing similar government stimulus funds drive demand in other parts of Europe.
The K-12 education sector represents one of the largest industry segments. In the US sector is comprised of approximately 15,600 public school districts across the 50 states and 132,000 public and private elementary and secondary schools. In addition to its size, the U.S. K-12 education market is highly decentralized and is characterized by complex content adoption processes. We believe this market structure underscores the importance of scale and industry relationships and the need for broad, diverse coverage across states, districts and schools. Even while we believe certain initiatives in the education sector, such as the Common Core State Standards, a set of shared math and literacy standards benchmarked to international standards, have increased standardization in K-12 education content, we believe significant state standard specific customization still exists, and we believe the need to address customization provides an ongoing need for companies in the sector to maintain relationships with individual state and district policymakers and expertise in state-varying academic standards.
According to “All Global Market Education & Learning,” an industry publication, the market for hardware products is growing due to increases in the use of interactive whiteboards and simulation-based learning hardware. Educational institutions have become more receptive to the implementation of high-tech learning tools. The advent of technology in the classroom has enabled multi-modal training and varying curricula. In general, technology-based tools help develop student performance when integrated with the curriculum. The constant progression of technology in education has helped educators to create classroom experiences that are interactive, developed and collaborative.

Our Opportunity
We believe that our Connected Classroom™ solution uniquely positions Boxlight to be the leading provider of EdTech products within our categories in the global education technology market. Our holistic solution of hardware, software, content and professional development improves learning progression by increasing student engagement and timely interventions. Coupled with our innovations, we have a strong brand, operations and supply-chain; our channel into the US and EMEA is very strong and the global market is growing year-on-year; with our global 24/7 technical and customer services team which retains a very high satisfaction rating.
Globally it is widely acknowledged that long-term economic growth is closely correlated to investment in education and educational technology, thus sustaining long-term growth in the market, even during periods of economic downturn. Further details of our solution and favorable macro-economic analysis are set forth below:
Growth in U.S. K-12 Market Expenditures
Significant resources are being devoted to primary and secondary education, both in the United States and abroad. As set forth in the Executive Office of the President, Council of Economic Advisers report, U.S. education expenditure has been estimated at approximately $1.3 trillion (~6% of U.S. GDP), with K-12 education accounting for close to half ($625 billion) of this spending. Global spending is roughly triple U.S. spending for K-12 education.
The market for K-12 services and technology has historically grown above the pace of inflation, averaging 7.2% growth annually since 1969. Deviations around this mean occur during periods of economic growth and recession causing peaks and troughs in the K-12 market, albeit below other sectors.
Justifying HolonIQ market analysis states that Global EdTech Venture Capital has been $32 billion in the last decade (approximately 33% within the US) and predicts nearly triple that investment through to 2030. Following that the global “expenditure on education and training from governments, parents, individuals and corporates continues to grow to historic levels and is expected to reach USD $10T by 2030”.
Futuresource, in 2019, stated: “Forecast [for US Interactive Display Market] for the next four years is expected to be strong, averaging 13% growth per year. The transition to IFPDs will contribute to the market almost doubling in value over five years to $1.6B in 2023.”
Increasing Focus on Accountability and the Quality of Student Education
U.S. K-12 education has come under significant political scrutiny in recent years, with findings that American students rank far behind other global leaders in international tests of literacy, math and science, with the resulting conclusion that the current state of U.S. education severely impairs the United States’ economic, military and diplomatic security as well as broader components of America’s global leadership.
Trends in Tech-Savvy Education
While industries from manufacturing to health care have adopted technology to improve their results, according to Stanford Business School, in its Trends in Tech-Savvy Education, the education field remains heavily reliant on “chalk and talk” instruction conducted in traditional settings; however, that is changing as schools and colleges adopt virtual classrooms, data analysis, online games, highly customized coursework, and other cutting-edge tools to help students learn.
New Technologies
The delivery of digital education content is also driving a substantial shift in the education market. In addition to whiteboards, interactive projectors and interactive flat panels, other technologies are being adapted for educational uses on the Internet, mobile devices and through cloud-computing, which permits the sharing of digital files and programs among multiple computers or other devices at the same time through a virtual network. We intend to be a leader in the development and implementation of these additional technologies to create effective digital learning environments.

Growth in the E-learning Market
According to the “E-learning Market – Global Outlook and Forecast 2020-2025”, the e-learning market is expected to display significant growth opportunities in the next five years. While the growth curve is uniform in terms of the number of users, the same is not the case by revenues; the average cost of content creation and delivery with the same is undergoing a consistent decline. However, the advent of cloud infrastructure, peer-to-peer problem solving, open content creation, and rapid expansion of the target audience has enabled e-learning providers to rein in economies of choice and offer course content at a competitive price. While the growth prospects of the e-learning market remain stable, the rise of efficient sub-segments is changing the learning and training landscape gradually.
Vendors are also focusing on offering choices on the course content at competitive prices to gain the share in the global e-learning market. The exponential growth in the number of smartphone users and internet connectivity across emerging markets is driving the e-learning market in these regions. The introduction of cloud-based learning and AR/VR mobile-based learning is likely to revolutionize the e-learning market during the forecast period.
Major vendors are introducing technology-enabled tools that can facilitate user engagement, motivate learners, and help in collaborations, thereby increasing the market share and attracting new consumers to the market. The growing popularity of blended learning that enhances the efficiency of learners will drive the growth of the e-learning market. The e-learning market is expected to generate revenue of $65.41 billion by 2023, growing at a CAGR of 7.07% during the forecast period.
Natural User Interfaces (NUIs)
Tablets and the new class of “smart TVs” are part of a growing list of other devices built with natural user interfaces that accept input in the form of taps, swipes, and other ways of touching; hand and arm motions; body movement; and increasingly, natural language. Natural user interfaces allow users to engage in virtual activities with movements similar to what they would use in the real world, manipulating content intuitively. The idea of being able to have a completely natural interaction with a device is not new, but neither has its full potential been realized. For example, medical students increasingly rely on simulators employing natural user interfaces to practice precise manipulations, such as catheter insertions, that would be far less productive if they had to try to simulate sensitive movements with a mouse and keyboard. NUIs make devices seem easier to use and more accessible, and interactions are far more intuitive, which promotes exploration and engagement.

MimioTeach Interactive Whiteboard
Boxlight’s MimioTeach is one of our best known and longest-lived products. Hundreds of thousands of MimioTeach interactive whiteboards and its predecessor models are used in classrooms around the world. MimioTeach can turn any whiteboard (retrofit) into an interactive whiteboard in as little as 30 seconds. This portable product fits into a tote bag with room for a small desktop projector, which is attractive to teachers who move from classroom to classroom. For schools where “change is our normal,” MimioTeach eliminates the high cost of moving fixed-mount implementations.
MimioFrame Touch Kit
MimioFrame can turn a projection (dry erase) board into an Interactive Whiteboard in 10-15 minutes. Millions of classrooms already have a conventional whiteboard and a non-interactive projector. MimioFrame uses infrared (IR) technology embedded in the four sides of the frame to turn that non-interactive combination into a modern 10-touch-interactive Digital Classroom. No drilling or cutting is required, MimioFrame easily and quickly attaches with industrial-strength double-sided tape.
MimioBoard Touch Interactive Whiteboard
Boxlight’s MimioBoard Interactive Touch Boards are available in 78” 4:3 aspect ratio and 87” 16:10 aspect ratio. These boards provide sophisticated interactivity with any projector because the touch interactivity is built into the board. Unlike many competitive products, Boxlight’s touch boards are suited for use with dry erase markers. Many competitive products advise against using dry erase markers because their boards stain. Boxlight’s touch boards use a porcelain-on-steel surface for durability and dry erase compatibility. The Boxlight Touch Boards are also much lighter weight than most competitive products which results in faster, easier and a lower cost installation process.
Non-Interactive Projectors
We distribute a full line of standard, non-interactive projectors. The Cambridge Series features embedded wireless display functions and is available in short and standard throw options. Offering brightness from 2,700 to 4,000 lumens, we furnish projectors for small classrooms to large classrooms with the Cambridge platform. This series is available in both XGA and WXGA resolutions to replace projectors on existing interactive whiteboards in classrooms operating on limited budgets. The Company has designed this platform to provide easy user maintenance with side-changing lamps and filters and developed HEPA filtration systems for harsh environments.
Over the past several years, working together with strategic allies, we have provided customized products that fit specific needs of customers, such as the Israeli Ministry of Defense. Working with Nextel Systems, the Company delivered approximately 4,000 projectors, with special kitting performance, asset tagging, custom start up screens, operating defaults appropriate for harsh environments, and other unique product specifications. The Company also met requirements that each projector contain at least 51% U.S. content and be assembled in the United States. A service center was appointed in Israel to provide warranty service and support. The US Army in connection with the Israeli Defense Forces found the Company to be the only manufacturer able to meet the stringent requirements, leading not only to the original multi-year contract, but to extensions for favorable execution and performance.

Classroom Audio Category
Not every classroom is acoustically efficient and not every child has normal hearing. However, learning is noticeably enhanced when each child receives clear, intelligible instruction throughout the day, regardless of class size, background noise, seat location, or if the child has a mild hearing loss. Audio systems are becoming standard for new construction and refurbishment projects, and the federal government passed the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and provides funding support for such solutions. For this reason, Boxlight has launched this new category and the debut product is MimioClarity. Boxlight also acquired FrontRow Calypso LLC, a California company and a leader in classroom and campus audio solutions for the education market.
STEM Category
Through the acquisitions of Modern Robotics, Robo3D and MyStemKits, Boxlight has added to its portfolio a growing category of STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) products.
Mimio MyBot
The Mimio MyBot system bridges the gap between learning about robotics in the classroom and the application of robotics in the real world. Our intuitive and accessible system helps students develop core skills in programming, engineering, and robotics. We provide a system to facilitate learning and ignite a passion in students with the freedom and flexibility to build, code, and test new and unique models. Mimio MyBot allows students to explore and learn freely while removing common obstacles such as requiring network infrastructure changes or expensive workstations.
Robo3D
Robo E3, Robo E3 Pro (Coming Soon) and Robo C2 are smart, safe, and simple 3D printers that come with access to over 300+ lessons of 3D printable STEM curriculum, replacement materials and accessories.
MyStemKits
MyStemKits offers hundreds of standards-driven lesson plans for grades K-12 math and science teachers. High-quality lessons plans are developed and studied by The Florida Center for Research in Science. Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (FCR-STEM), which is part of one of the nation’s oldest and most productive university-based education research organizations.
MimioView document camera
Boxlight’s MimioView 350U is a 4K document camera that is integrated with MimioStudio to make the combination easy to use with a single cable connection that carries power, video, and control. MimioView 350U is fully integrated into our MimioStudio software solution and is controlled through MimioStudio’s applications menu. With two clicks, the teacher or user can turn on, auto-focus, and illuminate the included LED lights for smooth high-definition images.
Educational Software Category
Boxlight’s suite of software is a combination of titles from acquisitions of Mimio and Qwizdom, both were leading brands in the IWB and Formative Assessment Software Categories, and since then capabilities have been built upon that IP since. The premise of our software is to:

● | Provide the “glue” that integrates the hardware to provide a Connected Classroom.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Help educators inform their decisions in the classroom, through more systematic data about their students’ performance and behaviors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Help make learning be more engaging, interactive, accessible and innovative.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

MimioStudio Interactive Instructional Software
MimioStudio Interactive Instructional Software enables the creation, editing, and presentation of interactive instructional lessons and activities. These lessons and activities can be presented and managed from the front of the classroom using any of Boxlight’s front of classroom display systems including MimioTeach + our non-interactive projectors, ProColor Interactive LED panels, MimioBoard Touch + our non-interactive projectors, MimioFrame + our non-interactive projectors or ProjectoWrite “P” Series interactive projectors in either pen or touch controlled versions. MimioStudio can also be operated using MimioPad as a full-featured remote control or a mobile device such as an iPad or tablet which includes a display screen that fully replicates the front-of-classroom display generated by MimioStudio. Operation with a mobile device is enabled via the three-user license for MimioMobile, provided with the MimioStudio license that accompanies all front-of-classroom devices from Mimio.
MimioMobile Collaboration and Assessment Application
The introduction of MimioMobile, a software accessory for MimioStudio, in 2014 introduced a new era of fully interactive student activities that are directly and immediately able to be displayed on the front-of-classroom interactive displays through MimioStudio.
MimioMobile allows fully interactive activities to be pushed to student classroom devices. The students can manipulate objects within the activities, annotate “on top” of them, and even create completely new content on their own handheld devices. MimioMobile also enables assessment using the mobile devices. The teacher can create multiple choice, true\false, yes\no, and text entry assessment questions. The students can respond at their own speed and their answers are stored within MimioStudio from which the teacher can display graphs showing student results. This “continuous assessment” allows formative assessment that can help guide the teacher as to whether to re-teach the material if understanding is low or move forward in the lesson. We believe that this interactive and student dependent instructional model can dramatically enhance student outcomes.
Oktopus Instructional and Whiteboarding Software
Designed specifically for touch-enabled devices, Oktopus Interactive Instructional Software enables the creation, editing, and presentation of interactive instructional lessons and activities. More than 70 interactive widgets, tools, and classroom game modes make it simple and fun to run ad-hoc or pre-planned sessions. Similar to MimioStudio, these lessons and activities can be presented and managed from the front of the classroom using any of Boxlight’s front of classroom display systems.
Notes+ Collaboration and Assessment Application
Notes+ is a software accessory for use with Oktopus Software or a PPT plugin that allows students to view and interact with the teacher presentation during a live class session. Students can answer questions, annotate, request help, and share content with the main display from nearly any mobile device or laptop. Question types supported include multiple choice, multiple-mark, yes/no, true/false, sequencing, numeric, and text response.
GameZones Multi-student Interactive Gaming Software
GameZones allows up to four students to work simultaneously on a touch screen or tablet to complete interactive ‘game style’ activities. The solution is extremely simple and easy to use and includes over 150 educational activities.
MimioInteract Multi-student Interactive Gaming Software
MimioInteract allows up to four students to work simultaneously on a touch screen or tablet to complete interactive ‘game style’ activities. The solution includes over 200 educational activities and allows teachers to create or modify activities through the software.

Peripherals and Accessories
We offer a line of peripherals and accessories, including amplified speaker systems, mobile carts, installation accessories and adjustable wall-mount accessories that complement our entire line of interactive projectors, interactive LED flat panels and standard projectors.
MimioVote Student Assessment System
Boxlight’s MimioVote is a handheld “clicker” that enables student assessment with essentially zero training. MimioVote is so simple it genuinely qualifies as intuitive, an elusive and often proclaimed attribute that is actually merited by MimioVote. MimioVote fully integrates into the MimioMobile environment and offers everything from attendance to fully immersive and on-the-fly student assessment. The MimioVote was specifically designed to survive the rigors of even kindergarten and elementary classrooms where being dropped, stepped on, and kicked are all part of a normal day. The handset’s non-slip coating helps keep it from sliding off desktops or out of little hands. Should they take “flight”, Mimio Vote’s rugged construction keeps each handset working.
MimioPad wireless pen tablet
MimioPad is a lightweight, rechargeable, wireless tablet used as a remote control for the MimioStudio running on a teacher’s Windows, Mac, or Linux computer. MimioPad enables the teacher to roam the classroom which significantly aids classroom management. MimioPad is a classroom management tool which can be handed off to enable a student to be part of the interactive experience – all without leaving their seat to go to the front of the room.

Integration Strategy
We have centralized our business management for all acquisitions through an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system which offers streamlined subsidiary integration utilizing a multi-currency platform. We have strengthened and refined the process to drive front-line sales forecasting to factory production. Through the ERP system, we have synchronized five separate accounting and customer relationship management systems through a cloud-based interface to improve inter-company information sharing and allow management of the Company to have immediate access to snapshots of the performance of each of our subsidiaries in a common currency. As we 

15



grow, organically or through acquisition, we plan to quickly integrate each subsidiary or division into the Company to allow for clearer and earlier visibility of performance to enable for timely and effective business decisions.
Logistics (Suppliers)
Logistics is currently provided in the US by our Lawrenceville, Georgia facility and internationally by the Sahara team in London. Together these teams manage and multiple third-party logistics partners throughout the world (3PL’s). These 3PL partners allow Boxlight to provide affordable freight routes and shorter delivery times to our customers by providing on-hand inventory in localized markets. Contract manufacturing for Boxlight products is through original design manufacturer (ODM) and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners according to Boxlight’s specific engineering specifications and utilizing IP developed and owned by Boxlight. Boxlight’s factories for ODM and OEM are located in the USA, Taiwan, China, and Germany.
Technical Support and Service
The Company currently has its core technical support and service centers located near Seattle, WA, Boston, MA, Atlanta, GA, London, England, and Belfast, Northern Ireland. Additionally, the Company’s technical support division is responsible for the repair and management of customer service cases, resulting in more than 60% of the Company’s customer service calls ending in immediate closure of the applicable service case. We accomplish this as a result of the familiarity between our products and having specialized customer service technicians hired internally and with key partners in certain international markets.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales force consists of 45 account managers in EMEA including a head of sales, 18 regional account managers in the US including a head of sales, one in Latin America, and a new role for head of corporate sales in the US. Our marketing team consists of one Vice President of Marketing Communications, one Marketing Coordinators, one Education Specialist, and one Graphic Designer). Our sales force and marketing teams primarily drive sales of all Boxlight products throughout North, Central and South America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. In addition, we go to market through an indirect channel distribution model and utilize traditional value-added resellers and support them with training to become knowledgeable about the products we sell. We currently have approximately 800 resellers.
We believe we offer the most comprehensive product portfolio in today’s education technology industry, along with best-in-class service and technical support. Our award-winning, interactive classroom technology and easy to use line of classroom hardware and software solutions provide schools and districts with the most complete line of progressive, integrated classroom technologies available worldwide.
Competition
The interactive education industry is highly competitive and characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of interactive projectors and interactive whiteboards. Interactive whiteboards, since first introduced, have evolved from a high-cost technology that involves multiple components, requiring professional installers, to a one-piece technology that is available at increasingly reduced-price points and affords simple installations. With lowered technology entry barriers, we face heated competition from other interactive whiteboard developers, manufacturers and distributors. We compete with other developers, manufacturers and distributors of interactive projectors and personal computer technologies, tablets, television screens and smart phones, such as Smart Technologies, Promethean, ViewSonic, Dell Computers, Samsung, Panasonic and ClearTouch.
Even with these competitors, the market presents new opportunities in responding to demands to replace outdated and failing interactive wthiteboards with more affordable and simpler solution interactive whiteboards. Our ability to integrate our technologies and remain innovative and develop new technologies desired by our current and potential new contract manufacturing customers will determine our ability to grow our contract manufacturing divisions. In addition, we have begun to see expansion in the market to sales of complementary products that work in conjunction with the interactive technology, including software, audio solutions, data capture and tablets.

Recent Financing
On December 31, 2021, the Company and substantially all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Boxlight, FrontRow, and Sahara as guarantors, entered into a maximum four year $68.5 million term loan credit facility, dated December 31, 2021 (the “Credit Agreement”), with Whitehawk Finance LLC, as lender (the “Lender”), and White Hawk Capital Partners, LP, as collateral agent(“the Collateral Agent”). Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company received an initial term loan of $58.5 million on December 31, 2021 (the “Initial Loan”) and obtained a delayed draw facility of up to $10 million (the “Delayed Draw”). The Initial Loan and the Delayed Draw are collectively referred to as The Term Loans. The Term Loans will bear interest at the LIBOR rate plus 10.75%; provided that after June 30, 2022, if the Company’s Senior Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than 2.25, the interest rate would be reduced to LIBOR plus 10.25%. Such terms are subject to the Company maintaining a borrowing base in terms compliant with the Credit Agreement.
The proceeds of the Initial Loan were used to finance the Company’s acquisition of FrontRow, pay off all indebtedness owed to our then lenders. The terms of the Credit Agreement and related loans are described in more detail in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.” The Initial Loan, $8.5 million, was subject to repayment on February 28, 2022, with quarterly principal payments of $625,000 and interest payments commencing March 31, 2022 and the $40.0 million remaining balance plus any Delayed Draw loans becoming due and payable in full on December 31, 2025. 
In conjunction with its receipt of the Initial Loan, the Company issued to the Lender (i) 528,169 shares of Class A common stock (the “Shares”), which Shares were registered pursuant to our existing shelf registration statement and were delivered to the Lender in January 2022, (ii) a warrant to purchase 2,043,291 shares of Class A common stock (subject to increase to the extent of 3% of any Series B and Series C convertible preferred stock converted into Class A common stock), exercisable at $2.00 per share (the “Warrant”), which Warrant may be subject to repricing on March 31, 2022 based on the arithmetic volume weighted average prices for the 30 trading days prior to March 31, 2022, in the event our stock is then trading below $2.00 per share, (iii) a 3% fee of $1,800,000 and (iv) a $500,000 original issue discount. In addition, the Company agreed to register for resale the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant. The Company also incurred agency fees, legal fees and other costs in connection with the execution of the Credit Agreement. Based on the arithmetic volume weighted average prices of the Company’s Class A common stock for the 30 trading days prior to March 31, 2022, the exercise price of the Warrant was reduced to $1.19 per share.
On March 29, 2022, the Company received a Notice of Events of Default and Reservation of Rights (the “Notice”) from the Collateral Agent. The Notice alleged, among other things, defaults as a result of (i) failure to repay $8.5 million of the facility by February 28, 2022, (ii) non-compliance with the borrowing base resulting in the Company being in an over advance position under the Credit Agreement, and (iii) failure to timely provide certain reports and documents. As a result of the Notice, all accrued and unpaid interest owed under the Term Loan, became subject to a post-default interest rate equal to the highest interest rate allowed for under the Credit Agreement plus 2.50% until such time as the Events of Default are either waived or cured. 
​
Following the Company’s receipt on March 29, 2022 of a Notice of Events of Default and Reservation of Rights (the “Notice”) described below, on April 4, 2022, the Company, the Lender and the Collateral Agent amended the Credit Agreement. The principal elements of the amendment included (a) an extension of time for the Loan Parties to repay $8.5 million of the principal amount of the term loan from February 28, 2022 to February 28, 2023, and (b) forbearance on $3,500,000 of over advances to grant the Loan Parties until May 16, 2022 to allow the Company to come into compliance with the borrowing base requirements set forth in the Credit Agreement. In such connection, the Loan Parties intend to obtain credit insurance on certain key customers whose principal offices are 

17



located in the European Union and Australia as their accounts owed to the Loan Parties were deemed ineligible for inclusion in the borrowing base calculation primarily due to the perceived inability of the Collateral Agent to enforce security interests on such accounts. 
​
In addition, the Lender and Collateral Agent agreed to (i) reduce, through June 30, 2022, the minimum cash reserve requirement for the Loan Parties, (ii) reduce the interest rate by 50 basis points (to Libor plus + 9.75%) after delivery of the Loan Parties’ June 30, 2023 financial statements, subject to the Loan Parties maintaining 1.75 EBITDA coverage ratio, and (iii) waive all prior Events of Default under the Credit Agreement. In conjunction with the amendment to the Credit Agreement, the parties entered into an amended and restated fee letter (the “Fee Letter”) pursuant to which the parties agreed to prepayment premiums of (i) 5% for payments made on or before December 31, 2022, (ii) 4% for payments made between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023, and (iii) 2% for payments made between January 1, 2024 and December 31, 2025. Furthermore, the parties agreed that no prepayment premiums would be payable with respect to the first $5.0 million paid under the Term Loan, any payments made in relation to the $8.5 million due on or before February 28, 2023, any required amortization payments under the Credit Agreement and any mandatory prepayments by way of ECF or casualty events.
