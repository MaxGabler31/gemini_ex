We are not a Chinese operating company but a Delaware holding company with operations conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries based in Hong Kong. Our holding company structure presents unique risks as our investors may never directly hold equity interests in our Hong Kong subsidiaries and will be dependent upon contributions from our subsidiaries to finance our cash flow needs. Our Hong Kong subsidiaries are currently not required to obtain permission from the Chinese authorities including the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, or Cybersecurity Administration Committee, or CAC, to operate or to issue securities to foreign investors. The business of our subsidiaries until now are not subject to cybersecurity review with the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC, given that: (i) data processed in our business does not have a bearing on national security and thus may not be classified as core or important data by the authorities; (ii) we do not possess a large amount of personal information in our business operations. In addition, we are not subject to merger control review by China’s anti-monopoly enforcement agency due to the level of our revenues which provided from us and audited by our auditor and the fact that we currently do not expect to propose or implement any acquisition of control of, or decisive influence over, any company with revenues within China of more than RMB400 million. Currently, these statements and regulatory actions have had no impact on our daily business operations, the ability to accept foreign investments and list our securities on an U.S. or other foreign exchange. However, since these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list our securities on an U.S. or other foreign exchange.

Further, in light of the recent statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government, such as those related to Hong Kong’s national security, the promulgation of regulations prohibiting foreign ownership of Chinese companies operating in certain industries, which are constantly evolving, and anti-monopoly concerns, we may be subject to the risks of uncertainty of any future actions of the PRC government in this regard, including the risk that we inadvertently conclude that such approvals are not required, that applicable laws, regulations or interpretations change such that we are required to obtain approvals in the future, which may result in a material change in our operations, including our ability to continue our existing holding company structure, carry on our current business, accept foreign investments, and offer or continue to offer securities to our investors, and the resulting adverse change in value to our common stock. We may also be subject to penalties and sanctions imposed by the PRC regulatory agencies, including the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission, if we fail to comply with such rules and regulations, which could adversely affect the ability of the Company’s securities to continue to trade on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, which may cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless. For a detailed description of the risks facing the Company and the offering associated with our operations in Hong Kong, please refer to “Risk Factors – Risk Factors Relating to Doing Business in Hong Kong.”
 
History
 
We were established as part of the Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Pacific Shores Development, Inc. ("PSD"). PSD and its subsidiary, Jovanovic-Steele, were in the real estate development business, and the real estate crash and the recession of 2008 made it impossible for them to obtain the financing needed to carry on their projects. In 2010, PSD filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of California ordered the incorporation of the Company and the distribution of the following securities:

• | 80,000 shares of the Company’s common stock were distributed to all general unsecured creditors of PSD on a pro rata basis according to amount of debt held;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock were distributed to all administrative creditors of PSD, with these creditors receiving one share of common stock in the Company for each $0.10 of PSD's administrative debt held;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 2,500,000 common stock purchase warrants of the Company were distributed to all administrative creditors of PSD, with these creditors receiving five common stock purchase warrants of the Company for each $0.10 of PSD's administrative debt held. The 2,500,000 warrants consisted of 500,000 "A Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $4.00; 500,000 "B Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $5.00; 500,000 "C Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $6.00; 500,000 "D Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $7.00; and 500,000 "E Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $8.00. All warrants are exercisable at any time prior to August 30, 2020.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The exercise price of the warrants was reduced to $0.10 per share on April 7, 2020, and on April 15, 2020, the warrant expiration date was extended to August 30, 2025.
 
On March 6, 2014, we issued 20,000 common shares for services at par value, $0.0001 per share, for total value of $2. On June 16, 2014, we issued a total of 15,000,000 common shares for services at par value, $0.0001 per share, for total value of $1,500. On August 1, 2017, we issued a total of 10,000 common shares for services at par value, $0.0001 per share, for a total value of $1.
 
On April 3, 2020, the Company, Linda Masters, our Chief Executive Officer and President, entered into that certain Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”), pursuant to which Ms. Masters agreed to sell to Lan CHAN 14,960,000 shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 (the “Shares”), representing approximately 95.8% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company, for aggregate consideration of Three Hundred Ninety One Thousand Dollars ($391,000) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the SPA. The acquisition of the Shares consummated on April 15, 2020, and was purchased by Lan CHAN with his personal funds. As a result of the acquisition, Mr. Chan holds a controlling interest in the Company and may unilaterally determine the election of the Board and other substantive matters requiring approval of the Company’s stockholders.

Upon the consummation of the sale of the Shares, Linda Masters, our Chief Executive Officer, President and director, and Kathleen Chula, our Vice President and Director, resigned from all of their positions with the Company, effective April 15, 2020. Their resignations were not due to any dispute or disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices.
 
Concurrently with such resignations, Lan CHAN was appointed to serve as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary and sole Director of the Company, until the next annual meeting of stockholders of the Company and until such director’s successor is elected and qualified or until such director’s earlier death, resignation or removal. None of the directors or executive officers has a direct family relationship with any of the Company’s directors or executive officers, or any person nominated or chosen by the Company to become a director or executive officer. Mr. Chan will serve in his positions without compensation. The Company hopes to enter into a compensatory arrangement with each officer in the future.

We strive to introduce high-quality games and deliver a superior game experience to our customers in order to retain their interest in our games. It is our constant endeavour to elevate the awareness of our brand-name in order to associate our brand with high-quality games and appealing game experience. This is achieved through investments in our game development team and staff, upgrades of software such as game engines, game-designing tools, and the acquisition of hardware to accommodate increasing technical demands for operating the games. Furthermore, we believe that our investment in technology, both in terms of hardware and software, would raise the barrier to entry for future competitors as well as maintaining our competitive edge against existing competitors.
 
Here are some rolling campaigns with the distribution of interactive game contents in the marketing events.

Development and Modification
 
Our project team in our technical department is responsible for creating game logic, in-game graphics as long as music and sound effect. The project team may further adopt other interactive technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), human motion sensing, gesture control, location-based detection, projection mapping and other special effects to our game so as to maximize the gaming experience for our players. We engage external service providers for the soundtracks, motion pictures and part of the artwork associated with the game. We also engage external third party services providers for special-themed game artwork.
 
During the development process, our project team will test-play the game to look for errors, bugs, lagging, faulty designs and etc. This is a continuous process until the project manager is satisfied with the performance and the overall playability of the alpha version.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS 
 
We expect to rely on, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our “Luduson” brand, as well as its related products and services. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.
 
The laws of Hong Kong, China and our target countries may not protect our brand and services and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, if at all. We may be unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights in these countries. Further, companies in the internet, social media technology and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
 
We intend to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets through a combination of copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, patents, confidentiality provisions and procedures and other contractual provisions, if applicable. We anticipate that the form of protection will vary depending upon the level of protection afforded by the particular jurisdiction. We expect that our revenue will be derived principally from our operations in Hong Kong and China where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. In such instances, we may seek protection of our intellectual property through measures taken to increase the confidentiality of our findings.
 
We intend to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our companies and products. We intend protect our trademarks against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate.
 
We rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. We expect that, where applicable, we will require our employees to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment with us. We expect these agreements to provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. The agreements will also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of our company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.
 
We also devote financial and operational resources to implement systems, processes and technologies to guard against cyber events and to help protect our intellectual property, employee and consumer data and information technology systems against intrusions or other security breaches. In addition, we engage in activities designed to limit the impact of abuse of our digital products and services, including monitoring our games for evidence of exploitation and re-balancing our game environments in the event that such abuse is discovered.

COMPETITION
 
Competition in the game industry is intense in Hong Kong and China. We compete with other game developers, operators and publishers of interactive games in Hong Kong and China. We may also face competition from emerging mobile game developers, operators and publishers, as well as some traditional online PC game companies that are entering the mobile game market. The game industry is fragmented and sensitive to price and service. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:

• | strong in-house game development expertise with a track record of successful games and robust pipeline;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | leading publishing platform;
--+-----------------------------


• | large game portfolio and diversified publishing network; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | collaborative culture led by a stable management team.
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | local presence and understanding of local business trends;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to minimize the time-to-market of the game solutions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to build up a high volume of game titles in the library;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to form partnership with famous IP and brand owners;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to assist our client to generate positive feedback on adopting our products; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strength and recognition of our brand.
--+---------------------------------------

 
Although we believe we compete favorably on the factors described above, many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, larger product and services offerings, larger customer base and greater brand recognition. These factors may allow our competitors to benefit from their existing customer base with lower development costs or to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements.
 
These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow them to build a larger customer base more effectively than us. Our competitors may develop products or services that are similar to our products and services or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services. In addition, although we do not believe that customer payment terms are a principal competitive factor in our market, they may become such a factor, and we may be unable to compete on such terms.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of March 23, 2022, we have the following full time employees: 
 

Administration / Finance | 2

We work with our programmers and developers on a contractual basis as they are not employees of the Company.
 
All of our employees are located in Hong Kong. None of our employees are members of a trade union. We believe that we maintain good relationships with our employees and have not experienced any strikes or shutdowns and have not been involved in any labor disputes.
 
GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATIONS
 
Our business is located in Hong Kong and is subject to the laws and regulations of Hong Kong governing businesses concerning, in particular labor, occupational safety and health, contracts, tort and intellectual property. Furthermore, we need to comply with the rules and regulations of Hong Kong governing the data usage and regular terms of service applicable to our potential customers or clients. As the information of our potential customers or clients is preserved in Hong Kong, we need to comply with the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance.
 
If PRC authorities reinterpret PRC laws to apply to Hong Kong companies, we may become subject to the laws and regulations of China governing businesses in general, including labor, occupational safety and health, contracts, tort and intellectual property. We may also become subject to foreign exchange regulations might limit our ability to convert foreign currency into Renminbi or Hong Kong Dollars, acquire any other PRC companies, establish VIEs in the PRC, or make dividend payments from any future WFOEs to us.
 
Hong Kong
 
The Employment Ordinance is the main piece of legislation governing conditions of employment in Hong Kong since 1968. It covers a comprehensive range of employment protection and benefits for employees, including Wage Protection, Rest Days, Holidays with Pay, Paid Annual Leave, Sickness Allowance, Maternity Protection, Statutory Paternity Leave, Severance Payment, Long Service Payment, Employment Protection, Termination of Employment Contract, Protection Against Anti-Union Discrimination. In addition, every employer must take out employees’ compensation insurance to protect the claims made by employees in respect of accidents occurred during the course of their employment.
 
An employer must also comply with all legal obligations under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance, (CAP485). These include enrolling all qualifying employees in MPF schemes and making MPF contributions for them. Except for exempt persons, employer should enroll both full-time and part-time employees who are at least 18 but under 65 years of age in an MPF scheme within the first 60 days of employment. The 60-day employment rule does not apply to casual employees in the construction and catering industries. Pursuant to the said Ordinance, we are required to make MPF contributions for our Hong Kong employees once every contribution period (generally the wage period within 1 month). Employers and employees are each required to make regular mandatory contributions of 5% of the employee’s relevant income to an MPF scheme, subject to the minimum and maximum relevant income levels. For a monthly-paid employee, the minimum and maximum relevant income levels are $7,100 and $30,000, respectively.
 
China
 
Depending upon the political climate, we may also become subject to the laws and regulations of China governing businesses in general, including labor, occupational safety and health, contracts, tort and intellectual property. We may also become subject to foreign exchange regulations might limit our ability to convert foreign currency into Renminbi, acquire PRC companies, or make dividend payments to ENMI.
Regulations on Tax
 
PRC Corporate Income Tax
 
The PRC corporate income tax, or CIT, is calculated based on the taxable income determined under the applicable CIT Law and its implementation rules, which became effective on January 1, 2008 and amended on February 24, 2017 and December 29, 2018 respectively. The CIT Law imposes a uniform corporate income tax rate of 25% on all resident enterprises in China, including foreign-invested enterprises.

Uncertainties exist with respect to how the CIT Law applies to the tax residence status of the Company and our offshore subsidiaries. Under the CIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with a “de facto management body” within China is considered a “resident enterprise,” which means that it is treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for corporate income tax purposes. Although the implementation rules of the CIT Law define “de facto management body” as a managing body that exercises substantive and overall management and control over the production and business, personnel, accounting books and assets of an enterprise, the only official guidance for this definition currently available is set forth in Circular 82 issued by the State Administration of Taxation, which provides guidance on the determination of the tax residence status of a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise, defined as an enterprise that is incorporated under the laws of a foreign country or territory and that has a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as its primary controlling shareholder. Although the Company does not have a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as our primary controlling shareholder and is therefore not a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise within the meaning of Circular 82, in the absence of guidance specifically applicable to us, we have made reference to the guidance set forth in Circular 82 to evaluate the tax residence status of the Company and our subsidiaries organized outside the PRC.
 
According to Circular 82, a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having a “de facto management body” in China and will be subject to PRC corporate income tax on its worldwide income only if all of the following criteria are met:
 

• | the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | decisions relating to the enterprise’s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; 
• | the enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholders meeting minutes are located or maintained in the PRC; and
• | 50% or more of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC. 

 
Currently, our Hong Kong entities are not considered entities inside China and therefore not deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes as defined above. However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term “de facto management body.” As all of our management members are based in Hong Kong, it remains unclear how the tax residency rule will apply to our case. If the PRC tax authorities determine that we or any of our subsidiaries outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, then we or such subsidiary could be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 25% on its world-wide income, as our entity enterprise in China is an state high-tech enterprise, it is possible to be impose 15% enterprise income tax on state high-tech enterprises in accordance with provisions of the Chinese tax law, thus materially reducing our net income. In addition, we will also be subject to PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. Furthermore, if the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, gains realized on the sale or other disposition of our ordinary shares may be subject to PRC tax, at a rate of 10% in the case of non-PRC enterprises or 20% in the case of non-PRC individuals (in each case, subject to the provisions of any applicable tax treaty), if such gains are deemed to be from PRC sources. It is unclear whether non-PRC shareholders of our company would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. Any such tax may reduce the returns on your investment in our common stock.
 
Value-Added Tax and Business Tax
 
The Provisional Regulations of the PRC on Value-added Tax (“VAT”) were promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993 and came into effect on January 1, 1994 which were subsequently amended on November 10, 2008, February 6, 2016 and November 19, 2017. The Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations of the PRC on Value-added Tax (Revised in 2011) were promulgated by the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation (“SAT”) on 28 October 2011 and came into effect on November 1, 2011 (collectively, the “VAT Law”). According to the VAT Law, all enterprises and individuals engaged in the sale of goods, the provision of processing, repair and replacement services, and the importation of goods within the territory of the PRC must pay value-added tax. For general VAT taxpayers selling or importing goods other than those specifically listed in the VAT Law, the VAT rate is 17%. Starting from April 1, 2019, the VAT rate for revenue generated from providing products was changed from 16% into 13%. VAT is reported as a deduction of revenue when incurred. Entities that are VAT general taxpayers are allowed to offset qualified input VAT paid to suppliers against their output VAT liabilities. Net VAT balance between input VAT and output VAT is recorded in taxes payable.

On March 23, 2016, the Ministry of Finance and the SAT jointly issued the Circular on Full Implementation of Business Tax to Value-added Tax Reform which has been partially repealed on July 1, 2017 and January 1, 2018, confirms that business tax would be completely replaced by VAT from May 1, 2016.
 
Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange and Dividend Distribution
 
Foreign Exchange Regulations
 
The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, may be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) by complying with certain procedural requirements. By contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans or foreign currency is to be remitted into China under the capital account, such as a capital increase or foreign currency loans to PRC subsidiaries. Our operating currency is the Hong Kong Dollar. If PRC authorities reinterpret foreign exchange regulations to include the Hong Kong Dollar, then we may become subject to the regulations affecting foreign exchange and dividend distributions as set forth herein.
 
In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment. Pursuant to this circular, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts, such as pre-establishment expense accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of RMB proceeds by foreign investors in the PRC, and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification of SAFE, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not possible previously. In addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC shall be conducted by way of registration and banks shall process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in the PRC based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches.
 
Additionally, pursuant to the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Simplifying and Improving the Direct Investment related Foreign Exchange Administration Policies (“SAFE Notice No. 13”), which was promulgated on February 13, 2015 and became effective on June 1, 2015, the foreign exchange registration in relation to foreign direct investment shall be directly reviewed and handled by qualified banks in accordance with SAFE Notice No. 13, and SAFE and its branches shall perform indirect regulation over the foreign exchange registration via qualified banks.
 
We typically do not need to use our offshore foreign currency to fund our Hong Kong operations. In the event we need to do so, we may be required to apply to obtain the relevant approvals of, registration or filing with SAFE and other PRC government authorities as necessary.
 
On August 29, 2008, SAFE issued the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 142. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 142, RMB resulting from the settlement of foreign currency capital of a foreign-invested enterprise must be used within the business scope as approved by the applicable government authority and cannot be used for domestic equity investment, unless it is otherwise approved. Documents certifying the purposes of the settlement of foreign currency capital into RMB, including a business contract, must also be submitted for the settlement of the foreign currency. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested company. The use of such RMB capital may not be altered without SAFE’s approval, and such RMB capital may not be used to repay RMB loans if such loans have not been used. Violations of SAFE Circular 142 could result in severe monetary fines or penalties. We expect that our use of RMB funds have been, and will be, within the approved business scope of our PRC subsidiary. We believe that our PRC subsidiary is permitted to conduct its castor seeds distribution operations and provide consulting services to castor farmers. However, we may not be able to use such RMB funds to make equity investments in the PRC through our PRC subsidiaries. There are no costs associated with applying for registration or approval of loans or capital contributions with or from relevant PRC governmental authorities, other than nominal processing charges. Under PRC laws and regulations, the PRC governmental authorities are required to process such approvals or registrations or deny our application within a prescribed time period, which is usually less than 90 days. The actual time taken, however, may be longer due to administrative delays. If we are required to obtain these registrations or approvals, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to our operations in Hong Kong. If we fail to receive such registrations or approvals, our ability to use the proceeds from our funds to capitalize our Hong Kong operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and ability to fund and expand our business.

SAFE Circular 37
 
SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced the former circular commonly known as “SAFE Circular 75” promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents’ legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a “special purpose vehicle.” SAFE Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Furthermore, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange controls. On February 13, 2015, SAFE Notice No. 13 was promulgated, pursuant to which the aforementioned registration shall be conducted with and handled by qualified banks.
 
We have notified substantial beneficial owners of our ordinary shares who we know are PRC residents of their filing obligation, and to the best of our knowledge, those shareholders whom we know are PRC residents have completed the registration or will carry out the registration as required under SAFE Circular 37. However, we may not be aware of the identities of all our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. In addition, we do not have control over our beneficial owners and cannot assure you that all of our PRC resident beneficial owners will comply with SAFE Circular 37. The failure of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents to register or amend their SAFE registrations in a timely manner pursuant to SAFE Circular 37 or the failure of future beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular 37 may subject such beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions. Failure to register or amend the registration may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries or receive dividends or other distributions from our PRC subsidiaries or other proceeds from disposal of our PRC subsidiaries, or we may be penalized by SAFE.
 
Share Option Rules
 
Under the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control issued by the PBOC on December 25, 2006, all foreign exchange matters involved in employee share ownership plans and share option plans in which PRC citizens participate require approval from SAFE or its authorized branch. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who participate in share incentive plans in overseas non-publicly-listed companies may submit applications to SAFE or its local branches for the foreign exchange registration with respect to offshore special purpose companies. In addition, under the Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Share Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies, or the Share Option Rules, issued by SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC residents who are granted shares or share options by companies listed on overseas stock exchanges under share incentive plans are required to (i) register with SAFE or its local branches, (ii) retain a qualified PRC agent, which may be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company or another qualified institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the share incentive plans on behalf of the participants, and (iii) retain an overseas institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of share options, purchase and sale of shares or interests and funds transfers.
Regulation of Dividend Distributions
 
The principal laws, rules and regulations governing dividend distributions by foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC are the Company Law of the PRC, as amended, the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law and its implementation regulations, the Chinese-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations, and the Chinese-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations. Under these laws, rules and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Both PRC domestic companies and wholly-foreign owned PRC enterprises are required to set aside a general reserve of at least 10% of their after-tax profit, until the cumulative amount of such reserve reaches 50% of their registered capital. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year.
