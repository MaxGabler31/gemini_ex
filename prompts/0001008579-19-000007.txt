Item 1.  Business
History and Business 
Highlands Bankshares, Inc. (the "Company") is a one-bank holding company organized under the laws of Virginia in 1995 and registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 ("BHCA"). The Company conducts the majority of its business operations through its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Highlands Union Bank (the "Bank"). The Company's single direct subsidiary as of December 31, 2018 is the Bank, which was formed in 1985. 
Highlands Union Bank 
The Bank is a Virginia state chartered bank that was incorporated in 1985. The Bank provides banking, insurance, wealth management, and other financial solutions through 14 banking offices, a loan production office, and 148 full-time equivalent associates located in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. 
The Bank offers retail and commercial banking products and services to individuals, businesses and local government customers. These products and services include traditional deposit and loan options, including checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, interest-bearing demand deposit accounts, savings accounts, time deposits, residential 1-4 family loans, owner occupied and non owner occupied commercial real estate loans, second mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, consumer, commercial/industrial, credit card and agricultural loans. Other products and services offered include automatic funds transfer, night depository, safe deposit, and other miscellaneous services normally offered by commercial banks. 
Highlands Union Insurance Services, Inc. 
Highlands Union Insurance Services, Inc., ("HUIS") a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank, was formed in 1999. The Bank, through HUIS, joined a consortium of approximately forty-seven other financial institutions to form Bankers' Insurance, LLC. Bankers' Insurance, LLC, as of December 31, 2018, had purchased multiple full service insurance agencies across the state of Virginia. HUIS sells insurance products and services through Bankers' Insurance, LLC. 
Highlands Union Financial Services, Inc.
Highlands Union Financial Services, Inc., ("HUFS") a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, was created to offer third party mutual funds and other financial services to its customers in all market areas served by the Bank. The only activity in Highlands Union Financial Services Inc. now relates to commissions from the sale of life insurance. 
Russell Road Properties, LLC 
Russell Road Properties, LLC was created to hold and manage certain properties acquired by the Bank through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure. 
Lending Activities
The Bank has written policies and procedures to help manage credit risk. The Bank's policy provides for three levels of lending authority. The first level of authority is granted to individual loan officers who have various levels of approval based upon their position and experience. The second level is the Credit Committee, which is comprised of senior officers of the Bank from all market areas. The Credit Committee considers loans that exceed the individual loan officers' lending authority and reviews loans to be presented to the Board's Risk Committee or the Board of Directors. In addition to approving loans that exceed the Credit Committee's authority, the board's Risk Committee reviews portfolio concentrations and other credit quality metrics. All lending policies are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. . 
The Bank has engaged an external third part to perform an independent review of the Bank's loan portfolio to identify loss exposure and to monitor compliance with the Bank's loan policy. The independent credit review seeks to review approximately 50 percent of outstanding loan balances each year. 
One-to-Four-Family Residential Real Estate Lending 
Residential loan opportunities may be generated by the Bank's loan officers, referrals by real estate professionals, and by existing or new bank clients. Loan applications are taken by a Bank loan officer. As part of the application process, information is gathered concerning income, employment and credit history of the applicant and originations are underwritten using policy guidelines. Security for the majority of one to four family residential loans is owner occupied single family dwellings. Values of residential real estate collateral are provided by independent appraisers who have been approved by the Bank's Board of Directors.

Second mortgages and Home Equity Lines of Credit are generated, underwritten and secured like single family residential real estate loans discussed above. Second mortgage loans are typically originated at higher interest rates than residential mortgage loans. Home equity lines of credit are typically variable-rate instruments based on a market index, although some have been originated with a promotional interest rate that reverts to standard pricing following a specified period of time. Second mortgages are typically made for no more than fifteen years. Home equity lines of credit mature in ten years. 
The Bank also originates adjustable rate products ("ARM") secured by one to four family residential properties with a repricing interval of three and five years. These products provide another outlet instead of secondary market loans and are generated, underwritten and secured the same as single family residential real estate loans discussed above. The Bank retains these loans in its loan portfolio. Senior Management adjusts the ARM rates based on competitive rates within the Bank's market area. The ARM products contain interest rate caps at adjustment periods and rate ceilings based on a cap over and above the original interest rate. Adjustable rate mortgages are underwritten based on payment amounts at the interest rate reaching the lifetime cap. 
At December 31, 2018, $199.4 million, or 44.4 percent, of the Bank's loan portfolio consisted of one-to four-family residential real estate loans, second mortgages, and home equity lines. Fixed rate loans are typically 3, 5, and 7 year balloon loans amortized over a 30 year period. In connection with residential real estate loans, the Bank requires hazard insurance, and if required, flood insurance. 
Multifamily Residential Real Estate Lending 
Loan applications for loans to be secured by multi-family residential properties are taken by a loan officer. As part of the application process, information is gathered concerning income, employment and credit history of the applicant, as well as rent rolls, operating costs and occupancy rates of the property to be financed. At December 31, 2018, $18.4 million, or 4.1 percent, of the Bank's loan portfolio consisted of multi-family residential properties. Loan originations are underwritten using the Bank's underwriting guidelines of a LTV of 80% and a cash flow coverage ratio of 1.25 or better. The valuation of multifamily residential collateral is provided by independent fee appraisers who have been approved by the Bank's Board of Directors. 
The Bank originates fixed rate and adjustable rate loans secured by multi-family properties, which are retained in the Bank's portfolio. Adjustable rate mortgages are underwritten based on payment amounts at the interest rate reaching the lifetime cap. 
Commercial, Construction, Farmland, Other Land Loans and Land Development Lending 
The Bank makes commercial, construction, farmland and land acquisition and development loans. These loans generally have a higher degree of risk than residential mortgage loans, but also have higher yields. To minimize these risks, the Bank normally obtains appropriate collateral and requires the personal guarantees from the borrower's principal owners and monitors the financial condition of its business borrowers. Commercial business loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from cash flow from its business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans is substantially dependent on the success of the business itself. Furthermore, the collateral for commercial business loans may depreciate over time and generally cannot be appraised with as much precision as historically been the case with residential real estate. 
At December 31, 2018, commercial real estate loans aggregated $136.1 million, or 30.3 percent, of the Bank's total loans. In its underwriting of commercial real estate, the Bank may lend, under its policy, up to 80% of the secured property's appraised value. The Bank's commercial real estate loan underwriting criteria require an examination of debt service coverage ratios and the borrower's creditworthiness, prior credit history and reputation. The Bank also evaluates the location of the secured property, and as noted above, typically requires personal guarantees or endorsements of the borrowing entity's principal owners. 
Construction and Land Development loans, including acquisition and development loans, are primarily those secured by residential houses and commercial structures under construction and the underlying land for which the loan was obtained. Over the past two years the Bank has significantly reduced the number of originations of construction and land development loans in all of its market areas in an effort to reduce portfolio risk. 
At December 31, 2018, construction, farmland, and other land loans outstanding were $33.2 million, or 7.4 percent, of total loans. Construction lending entails significant additional risks and often involves larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Another risk involved in construction lending is attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced to fund construction, the value of which is estimated prior to the completion of construction on an "as built" basis. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately estimate the total loan funds required to complete the project and the completed loan-to-value ratios. To mitigate the risks associated with construction lending, the Bank generally limits loan amounts to 80% of as built appraised value, in addition to analyzing the creditworthiness of its borrowers. The Bank obtains a first lien on the property as security for construction loans, monitors the construction and advance process and, if a business entity, typically requires personal guarantees from the borrowing entity's principal owners.

Commercial and Agricultural Lending-- Non-Real Estate Secured and Unsecured 
The Bank makes local commercial and agricultural unsecured and non-real estate secured loans. These loans generally have a higher degree of risk than other loans. To manage these risks, the Bank generally obtains collateral, such as assignments of inventory or accounts receivable, equipment, and personal guarantees from the borrowing entity's principal owners. In its underwriting of commercial and agricultural non-real estate secured loans, the Bank may lend, under internal policy, up to 80% of the secured collateral appraised value. The Bank's commercial and agricultural non-real estate secured and unsecured underwriting criteria require adequate debt service coverage ratios and the borrower's creditworthiness, prior credit history and reputation. As commercial business and agricultural non-real estate secured loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from cash flow, the availability of funds for the repayment is substantially dependent on the success of the business itself. 
At December 31, 2018, commercial and agricultural non-real estate secured loans including unsecured loans aggregated $49.0 million, or 10.9 percent, of the Bank's total loans. 
Consumer Lending-Non Real Estate Secured and Unsecured 
The Bank offers various secured and unsecured consumer loans, including unsecured personal loans and lines of credit, automobile loans, deposit account loans made on both an installment and demand basis. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had consumer loans of $12.8 million or 2.8 percent of gross loans. Such loans are generally made to customers with whom the Bank has a pre-existing relationship, often deposit and residential mortgage relationships. The Bank only originates its consumer loans in its geographic market area. The underwriting standards employed by the Bank for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts and an assessment of the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant's monthly income may be determined by the verification of gross monthly income from primary employment and additionally from any verifiable secondary source. The applicant's FICO scores are also analyzed with the credit report analysis. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes an analysis of the value of the available collateral, if applicable. 
Consumer loans may entail significant risk, particularly if unsecured, such as lines of credit, or secured by rapidly depreciable assets such as automobiles. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans. Such loans may also give rise to claims and defenses by a consumer borrower against an assignee of collateral securing the loan such as the Bank and a borrower may raise claims which it has against the seller of the underlying collateral to prevent collection. 
Participation Loans 
In addition to secondary marketing activities related to 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, the Bank will occasionally buy or sell all or a portion of a loan. The Bank will consider selling a loan or a participation in a loan, if: (i) the full amount of the loan to a single borrower will exceed the Bank's legal lending limit, which is 15 percent of the unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus of the Bank; (ii) the full amount of the loan, when combined with a borrower's previously outstanding loans, will exceed the Bank's legal lending limit to a single borrower; (iii) the Board of Directors or the Senior Officer Loan Committee believes that a particular borrower has a sufficient level of debt with the Bank; (iv) the borrower requests the sale; (v) the loan to deposit ratio is at or above the optimal level as determined by Bank management; and/or (vi) the loan may create too great a concentration of loans in one particular location, one industry or in one particular type of loan. The Bank will consider purchasing a participation in a loan from another financial institution if the loan meets all applicable credit quality standards; (i) the Bank's loan to deposit ratio is at a level where additional loans would be desirable; and/or (ii) a common customer requests the purchase. 
The following table sets forth, for the two fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the percentage of total operating revenue contributed by each class of similar services which contributed 15% or more of total operating revenues of the Company during such periods. 

Year Ended | Class of Service | Percentage of Total Revenues
December 31, 2018 | Interest and Fees on Loans | 88.26% 
December 31, 2017 | Interest and Fees on Loans | 81.83%

Competition 
The banking and financial service business in Virginia, North Carolina and Tennessee generally, and in the Bank's market areas specifically, is highly competitive. The increasingly competitive environment is a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems and new competition from non-traditional financial services. The Bank competes for loans and deposits with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, money market funds, credit unions and other non-bank financial service providers. Many of these competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader array of financial services than the Bank. 
In order to compete, the Bank relies upon service-based business philosophies, personal relationships with customers, specialized services tailored to meet customers' needs and the convenience of office locations and extended hours of operation. The Bank is generally competitive with other financial institutions in its market areas with respect to interest rates paid on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans and other service charges on loans and deposit accounts. Deposit market share for each of the Bank's market areas can be found on the FDIC's website at www.fdic.gov under the Industry Analysis/Summary of Deposits section.

Regulatory Considerations
The Company and the Bank are subject to various state and federal banking laws and regulations which impose specific requirements or restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight with respect to virtually all aspects of operations. As a result of the substantial regulatory burdens on banking, financial institutions, including the Company and the Bank, are disadvantaged relative to other competitors who are not as highly regulated, and our costs of doing business are much higher. 
The following is a summary of the material provisions of certain statutes, rules and regulations which affect the Company and the Bank. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions referred to below, and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations which are applicable to the business of the Company and the Bank. Any change in applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on the business and prospects of the Company and the Bank. 
Highlands Bankshares, Inc. 
The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the BHCA and a financial institution holding company within the meaning of Chapter 7 of the Virginia Banking Act, as amended (the Virginia Banking Act). The activities of the Company also are governed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. 
The Bank Holding Company Act. The BHCA is administered by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, and the Company is required to file with the Federal Reserve an annual report and any additional information the Federal Reserve Board may require under the BHCA. The Federal Reserve Board also is authorized to examine the Company and its subsidiaries. The BHCA requires every bank holding company to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before (i) it or any of its subsidiaries (other than a bank) acquires substantially all the assets of any bank; (ii) it acquires ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if after the acquisition it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the voting shares of the bank; or (iii) it merges or consolidates with any other bank holding company. 
The BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board, require that, depending on the particular circumstances, either Federal Reserve Board approval must be obtained or notice must be furnished to the Federal Reserve Board and not disapproved prior to any person or company acquiring "control" of a bank holding company, such as the Company, subject to certain exemptions. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the Company. Control is presumed to exist (but rebuttable) if a person acquires 10% or more, but less than 25%, of any class of voting securities of the Company. The regulations provide a procedure for challenging the rebuttable control presumption. 
Under the BHCA, a bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in non-banking activities, unless the Federal Reserve Board, by order or regulation, has found those activities to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be incident to banking. Subject to its capital requirements and certain other restrictions, the Company can borrow money to make a capital contribution to the Bank, and these loans may be repaid from dividends paid from the Bank to the Company (although the ability of the Bank to pay dividends are subject to regulatory restrictions). The Company can raise capital for contribution to the Bank by issuing securities without having to receive regulatory approval, subject to compliance with federal and state securities laws. 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the GLBA) permits significant combinations among different sectors of the financial services industry; allows for significant expansion of financial service activities by bank holding companies and provides for a regulatory framework by various governmental authorities responsible for different financial activities; and offers certain financial privacy protections to consumers. The GLBA repealed affiliation and management interlock prohibitions of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act and, by amending the Bank Holding Company Act, the GLBA added new substantive provisions to the non-banking activities permitted under the BHCA with the creation of the financial holding company. The GLBA preempts most state laws that prohibit financial holding companies from engaging in insurance activities. The GLBA permits affiliations between banks and securities firms within the same holding company structure, and the GLBA permits financial holding companies to directly engage in a broad range of securities and merchant banking activities. The Company has not elected to become a financial holding company. The GLBA has led to important changes in the manner in which financial services are delivered in the United States. Bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks are able to offer a much broader array of financial services; however, there is greater competition in all sectors of the financial services market. 
The Virginia Banking Act. All Virginia bank holding companies must register with the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the "Commission") under the Virginia Banking Act. A registered bank holding company must provide the Commission with information with respect to the financial condition, operations, management and inter-company relationships of the holding company and its subsidiaries. The Commission also may require such other information as is necessary to keep informed about 
7

whether the provisions of Virginia law and the regulations and orders issued under Virginia law by the Commission have been complied with, and may make examinations of any bank holding company and its subsidiaries. The Virginia Banking Act allows bank holding companies located in any state to acquire a Virginia bank or bank holding company if the Virginia bank or bank holding company could acquire a bank holding company in their state and the Virginia bank or bank holding company to be acquired has been in existence and continuously operated for more than two years. The Virginia Banking Act permits bank holding companies from throughout the United States to enter the Virginia market, subject to federal and state approval. 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "SOX Act") implemented legislative reforms intended to address corporate and accounting fraud. In addition to the establishment of a new accounting oversight board that enforces auditing, quality control and independence standards and is funded by fees from all publicly traded companies, the law restricts provision of both auditing and consulting services by accounting firms. To ensure auditor independence, any non-audit services being provided to an audit client requires pre-approval by the issuer's audit committee members and the SOX Act also restricts certain services that the audit firm may perform. In addition, audit partners must be rotated. The SOX Act requires chief executive officers and chief financial officers, or their equivalent, to certify to the accuracy of periodic reports filed with the SEC, subject to civil and criminal penalties if they knowingly or willfully violate this certification requirement. In addition, under the SOX Act, legal counsel is required to report evidence of a material violation of the securities laws or a breach of fiduciary duty by a company to its chief executive officer or its chief financial officer, and, if such officer does not appropriately respond, to report such evidence to the audit committee or other similar committee of the board of directors or the board itself. 
Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), made significant changes in the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act included several provisions that will affect how community banks, thrifts, and small bank and thrift holding companies will be regulated in the future. Among other things, these provisions abolished the Office of Thrift Supervision and transferred its functions to the other federal banking agencies, relaxed rules regarding interstate branching, allowed financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts, changed the scope of federal deposit insurance coverage, and imposed new capital requirements on bank and thrift holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act also established the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, which is given the authority to promulgate consumer protection regulations applicable to all entities offering consumer financial services or products, including banks. 
The Dodd-Frank Act also required the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to issue regulations requiring lenders to make a reasonable good faith determination as to a prospective borrower's ability to repay a residential mortgage loan. The final "Ability to Repay" rules, which were effective January 4, 2013, established a "qualified mortgage" safe harbor for loans whose terms and features are deemed to make the loan less risky. In addition, on October 3, 2015, the new TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID) rules for mortgage closings took effect for new loan applications. 
Some provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act involved delayed effective dates and/or require implementing regulations or have not been issued in final form. Their full impact on our operations cannot yet fully be assessed. However, the Dodd-Frank Act has resulted in increased compliance and operating expense for the Company. 
Highlands Union Bank
General. The Bank, as a state chartered member of the Federal Reserve, is subject to regulation and examination by the Virginia State Corporation Commission Bureau of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. In addition, the Bank is subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Deposits in the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to a maximum amount (generally $250,000 per depositor, subject to aggregation rules). The Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau of Financial Institutions regulate or monitor all areas of the Bank's operations, including security devices and procedures, adequacy of capitalization and loss reserves, loans, investments, borrowings, deposits, mergers, issuances of securities, payment of dividends, interest rates paid on deposits, interest rates or fees charged on loans, establishment of branches, corporate reorganizations and maintenance of books and records. The Federal Reserve Board requires the Bank to maintain certain capital ratios. The Bank is required by the Federal Reserve Board to prepare quarterly reports on the Bank's financial condition and to conduct an annual audit of its financial affairs in compliance with minimum standards and procedures prescribed by the Federal Reserve Board. The Bank also is required by the Federal Reserve Board to adopt internal control structures and procedures in order to safeguard assets and monitor and reduce risk exposure. While appropriate for safety and soundness of banks, these requirements impact banking overhead costs. 
Under the provisions of federal law, federally insured banks are subject, with certain exceptions, to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to their affiliates, on investments in the stock or other securities of affiliates and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral from any borrower. In addition, these banks are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or the providing of any property or service. The Virginia State Corporation Commission and the Federal Reserve Board conduct regular examinations of the Bank reviewing the adequacy of 
8

the loan loss reserves, quality of the loans and investments, propriety of management practices, compliance with laws and regulations and other aspects of the bank's operations. In addition to these regular examinations, Virginia chartered banks must furnish to the Federal Reserve Board quarterly reports containing detailed financial statements and schedules. 
Community Reinvestment Act. The Bank is subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the "CRA"), which requires the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency, in connection with its regular examination of a bank, to assess the bank's record in meeting the credit needs of the community served by the Bank, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The focus of the regulations is on the volume and distribution of a bank's loans, with particular emphasis on lending activity in low and moderate-income areas and to low and moderate-income persons. The regulations place substantial importance on a bank's product delivery system, particularly branch locations. The regulations require banks to comply with significant data collection requirements. The regulatory agency's assessment of the bank's record is made available to the public. Further, this assessment is required for any bank which has applied to, among other things, establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, relocate an existing office, or merge, consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of a federally regulated financial institution. Management expects that the Bank's compliance with the CRA, as well as other fair lending laws, will face ongoing government scrutiny and that costs associated with compliance will continue to increase. The Bank received a "Satisfactory" CRA rating in the last examination by bank regulators. 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) requires each federal banking regulatory agency to prescribe, by regulation, standards for all insured depository institutions and depository institution holding companies relating to (i) internal controls, information systems and audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest rate exposure; (v) asset growth; (vi) compensation, fees and benefits; and (vii) such other operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to be appropriate. The compensation standards prohibit employment contracts, compensation or benefit arrangements, stock option plans, fee arrangements or other compensatory arrangements that provide excessive compensation, fees or benefits or could lead to material financial loss. In addition, each federal banking regulatory agency must prescribe by regulation standards specifying (i) a maximum ratio of classified assets to capital; (ii) minimum earnings sufficient to absorb losses without impairing capital; (iii) to the extent feasible, a minimum ratio of market value to book value for publicly traded shares of depository institutions and depository institution holding companies; and (iv) such other standards relating to asset quality, earnings and valuation as the agency determines to be appropriate. If an insured institution fails to meet any of the standards promulgated by regulation, then such institution will be required to submit a plan to its federal regulatory agency specifying the steps it will take to correct the deficiency. 
Prompt corrective action measures adopted in FDICIA impose significant restrictions and requirements on depository institutions that fail to meet their minimum capital requirements. Under Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the FDI Act), the federal banking regulatory agencies have developed a classification system pursuant to which all depository institutions are placed into one of five categories based on their capital levels and other supervisory criteria: well capitalized, adequately capitalized; undercapitalized; significantly undercapitalized; and critically undercapitalized. 
The Bank met the requirements at December 31, 2018 to be classified as "well-capitalized." This classification is determined solely for the purposes of applying the prompt corrective action regulations and may not constitute an accurate representation of the Bank's overall financial condition. 
If its principal federal regulator determines that an adequately capitalized institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or is engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice, it may require the institution to submit a corrective action plan, restrict its asset growth and prohibit branching, new acquisitions and new lines of business. An institution's principal federal regulator may deem it to be engaging in unsafe or unsound practices if it receives a less than satisfactory rating for asset quality, management, earnings or liquidity in its most recent examination. 
Section 36 of FDICIA requires insured depository institutions with at least $500 million but less than $1 billion in total assets to file annual reports that must include the following: 

• | Audited comparative annual financial statements


• | The independent public accountant's report on the audited financial statements


• | A management report that contains a statement of management's responsibilities for preparing the financial statement, establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure over financial reporting and complying with the laws and regulations designed by the FDIC and appropriate banking regulators


• | An assessment by management of the institution's compliance with the designated laws and regulations during the year.

The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the Interstate Act) allows bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, without regard to state law, except that if the state has a minimum requirement for the amount of time a bank must be in existence, that law must be preserved. Under the Virginia Banking Act, a Virginia bank or all of the 
9

subsidiaries of Virginia holding companies sought to be acquired must have been in continuous operation for more than two years before the date of such proposed acquisition. The Interstate Act also permits banks to acquire out-of-state branches through interstate mergers, if the state has not opted out of interstate branching. De novo branching, where an out-of-state bank holding company sets up a new branch in another state, requires a state's specific approval. An acquisition or merger is not permitted under the Interstate Act if the bank, including its insured depository affiliates, will control more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the United States, or will control 30% or more of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in any state. 
Virginia has, by statute, elected to opt-in fully to interstate branching under the Interstate Act. Under the Virginia statute, Virginia state banks may, with the approval of the Virginia State Corporation Commission, establish and maintain a de novo branch or acquire one or more branches in a state other than Virginia, either separately or as part of a merger. Procedures also are established to allow out-of-state domiciled banks to establish or acquire branches in Virginia, provided the "home" state of the bank permits Virginia banks to establish or acquire branches within its borders. The activities of these branches are subject to the same laws as Virginia domiciled banks, unless such activities are prohibited by the law of the state where the bank is organized. The Virginia State Corporation Commission has the authority to examine and supervise out-of-state state banks to ensure that the branch is operating in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with the laws of Virginia. The Virginia statute authorizes the Bureau of Financial Institutions to enter into cooperative agreements with other state and federal regulators for the examination and supervision of out-of-state banks with Virginia operations, or Virginia domiciled banks with operations in other states. Likewise, national banks, with the approval of the OCC, may branch into and out of the state of Virginia. Any Virginia branch of an out-of-state state chartered bank is subject to Virginia law (enforced by the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions) with respect to intrastate branching, consumer protection, fair lending and community reinvestment as if it were a branch of a Virginia bank, unless preempted by federal law. 
Deposit Insurance. The Bank's deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the FDIC. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, FDIC insurance coverage limits on deposits were permanently increased to $250,000. 
The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system to determine assessment rates to be paid by member institutions, such as the Bank. The amount of the assessment is a function of the institution's assessment rate and its assessment base. Under this system, an institution's supervisory ratings, combined with certain other risk measures, including certain financial ratios. In February 2011, the FDIC revised the risk-based assessment system to set new assessment rates that were effective on April 1, 2011. The initial base assessment rates currently range from 3 to 30 basis points, subject to potential adjustments based on the amount of the institution's long-term unsecured debt. After the effect of potential base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate can range from 1.5 to 30 basis points. As the DIF reserve ratio grows, the rate schedule will be adjusted downward. Also effective April 1, 2011, the assessment base is an institution's average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the GLBA) allows banks, with primary regulator approval, to acquire financial subsidiaries to engage in any activity that is financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity, as defined in the Bank Holding Act, except (i) insurance underwriting, (ii) merchant or insurance portfolio investments, and (iii) real estate development or investment. Well-capitalized banks are also given the authority to engage in municipal bond underwriting. 
To establish or acquire a financial subsidiary, a bank must be well-managed, and the consolidated assets of its financial subsidiary must not exceed the lesser of 45% of the consolidated total assets of the bank or $50 billion. The relationship between a bank and a financial subsidiary are subject to a variety of supervisory enhancements from regulators. 
USA Patriot Act. The USA Patriot Act facilitates the sharing of information among government entities and financial institutions to combat terrorism and money laundering. The USA Patriot Act creates an obligation on banks to report customer activities that may involve terrorist activities or money laundering. 
Government Policies. The operations of the Bank are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the policies of various regulatory authorities. In particular, the Federal Reserve Board regulates money and credit and interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions. These policies have a significant influence on overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits and affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for time and savings deposits. Federal Reserve Board monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. 
Limits on Dividends and Other Payments. The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank; virtually all of the Company's cash reserves, and its ability to pay dividends to the Company's shareholders, are dependent on the ability of the Bank to upstream dividends to it. As a state member bank subject to the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, the Bank must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any dividend if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits, as defined by the Federal Reserve Board, for that year, combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board is authorized to determine, under certain 
10

circumstances relating to the financial condition of a state member bank, that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. The payment of dividends that depletes a bank's capital base could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice. 
Virginia law also imposes restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends. A Virginia state bank is permitted to declare a dividend out of its "net undivided profits", after providing for all expenses, losses, interest and taxes accrued or due by the bank. In addition, a deficit in capital originally paid in must be restored to its initial level, and no dividend can be paid which could impair the Bank's paid in capital. The Bureau of Financial Institutions further has authority to limit the payment of dividends by a Virginia bank if it determines the limitation is in the public interest and is necessary to ensure the bank's financial soundness. 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) provides that no insured depository institution may make any capital distribution (which would include a cash dividend) if, after making the distribution, the institution would not satisfy one or more of its minimum capital requirements. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that banking organizations, including bank holding companies, should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. Federal regulators also have indicated that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends only if the organization's net income available to company shareholders is sufficient to fully fund the dividends as well as maintaining sufficient capital levels. 
Capital Requirements 
The federal banking agencies adopted new regulations that implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. 
Effective January 1, 2015, the Bank became subject to new capital requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve (with some changes transitioned into full effectiveness over two to four years). The new requirements created a new required ratio for common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital, increased the leverage and Tier 1 capital ratios, changed the risk weight of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, created an additional capital conservation buffer over the required capital ratios and changed what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting these various capital requirements. CET1 generally consists of common stock and retained earnings, subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. 
Beginning in 2016, failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer will limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends or pay discretionary bonuses. The Company is exempt from consolidated capital requirements as those requirements do not apply to certain small bank holding companies with assets under $1 billion. 
Under the new capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios are as follows: 

• | CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets (new);


• | Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets (increased from 4%);


• | Total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets (unchanged); and,


• | Leverage ratio of 4.0% (unchanged).

There are a number of changes in what constitutes regulatory capital, some of which are subject to transition periods. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. The Bank does not use any of these instruments. Under the new requirements for total capital, Tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital included in total capital. Mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated percentages of CET1 will be deducted from capital. The Bank has elected to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income in our capital calculations, as permitted by the regulations. This opt-out will reduce the impact of market volatility on our regulatory capital levels. 
The new requirements also include changes in the risk-weights of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposures. These include a 150% risk weight (increased from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in non-accrual status; a 20% (increased from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable; a 250% risk weight (increased from 100%) for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital; and increased risk weights (0% to 600%) for equity exposures. 
In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, the Bank will have to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends or paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. Phase-in of this new capital conservation buffer requirement commenced in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. 
11

Under the new standards, which became effective January 1, 2015, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the Bank must have a CET1 ratio of 6.5% (new), a Tier 1 ratio of 8.0% (increased from 6.0%), a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% (unchanged), and a leverage ratio of 5.0% (unchanged). 
The risk-based capital standards of the Federal Reserve explicitly identify concentrations of credit risk and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as an institution's ability to manage these risks, as important factors to be taken into account by the agency in assessing an institution's overall capital adequacy. The capital guidelines also provide that an institution's exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates be considered by the agency as a factor in evaluating a banking organization's capital adequacy. 
The FDIC may take various corrective actions against any undercapitalized bank and any bank that fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement a plan accepted by the FDIC. These powers include, but are not limited to, requiring the institution to be recapitalized, prohibiting asset growth, restricting interest rates paid, requiring prior approval of capital distributions by any bank holding company that controls the institution, requiring divestiture by the institution of its subsidiaries or by the holding company of the institution itself, requiring new election of directors, and requiring the dismissal of directors and officers. The Company and the Bank presently maintain sufficient capital to remain in compliance with these capital requirements. 
Other Legislative and Regulatory Concerns 
Other legislative and regulatory proposals regarding changes in banking and the regulation of banks, thrifts and other financial institutions are periodically considered by the executive branch of the federal government, Congress and various state governments, including Virginia. New proposals could significantly change the regulation of banks and the financial services industry. It cannot be predicted what might be proposed or adopted or how these proposals would affect the Company. 
Formal Written Agreement 
On October 13, 2010, the Company and Bank entered into a written agreement ("Written Agreement") with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (the "Reserve Bank").
