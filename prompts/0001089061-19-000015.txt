ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

OVERVIEW
 
Findex.com, Inc. is headquartered in Lake Park, Florida with its base of business operations co-located in the same facility. The Company is currently comprised of two operating companies, EcoSmart Surface & Coating Technologies, Inc., a Florida corporation (“EcoSmart”), and Advanced Cement Sciences, LLC (formerly Advanced Nanofibers, LLC), a Florida limited liability company (“ACS”). Although up until December 2018, ACS had been only partially owned by us (a minority 31.05%), as of December 2018, both entities are now our wholly-owned subsidiaries. EcoSmart has historically been the driver of both operating overhead and revenue. It was acquired by us in a merger in 2014 and centers around a proprietary line of specialty surface coatings that have a broad range of value-adding industrial, commercial, residential and consumer applications. With a line of products carrying the brand name “EcoSmart,” both the business unit (as distinct from the corporate subsidiary in which it is housed) and the line of products itself are currently in the process of being re-branded under the name “RexPro (Sealers and Coatings),” which is how it is referred to hereinafter throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A recent material development in the RexPro business plan is an extension, currently underway but only in the earliest of stages, to vertically integrate its interior flooring and exterior hardscape coatings products business with a service business focused on the applications of those products. ACS is a Florida-based, engineered cement technology and products firm founded in mid-2016 and currently focused on developing and commercializing a line of proprietary admixtures to be used in the production of ultra-lightweight, high-strength concrete and high-performance stucco. Despite its lack of material revenue to date, ACS is a venture that our management had been very actively involved in developing since 2016 and into which we have invested significantly, but that, due to a lack of available company financial resources coupled with ACS’s lack of near-term prospects for generating material revenue, has been the subject in recent months of considerably reduced allocations of our available capital and human resources, a trend we expect to continue unless and until our financial condition substantially improves.

REXPRO ADVANCED COATINGS 
 
Our RexPro advanced coatings division, currently our core business and expected to remain so for the indefinite future, centers around a portfolio of cutting-edge chemistry technologies that we acquired in 2014 as part of the merger with EcoSmart and have since further developed. The formulations and related trade secrets comprising these base coating technologies have restorative and protective value-adding application across a wide variety of industries and products. Among others, these include the following:

▪ | HVAC Units and Related Peripheral Equipment 
--+----------------------------------------------------------
▪ | Automobiles and Motorcycles 
▪ | Boats and Other Marine Vessels 
▪ | Heavy Truck and Construction Equipment 
▪ | Oil, Gas & Mining Infrastructure 
▪ | Interior Flooring and Exterior Hardscape Surface Products

 
Broadly viewed, the surface is an integral aspect of virtually every physical object and often plays a fundamental role in many of the processes, beyond mere connectivity and structural support, that govern chemical and biological interactions involving the product. In some instances, the surface serves to protect the internal elements of the object that it surrounds; in others, it provides an entry point into those chemical or biological systems. In most, combinations of these attributes are present, and the potential variations are both vast in number and complex in structure.
 
Our specialty coatings business produces, markets, and distributes a line of effectively invisible glass-based specialty coatings – “smart surfaces” – that have a wide range of industrial, commercial, and household applications that fortify the substrate surface through a variety of protective and other features. Conventional coatings, which are bonded by mechanical means to whatever surface to which they are applied, tend to fail, ultimately, in the bonding to the substrate, typically due to poor surface preparation or variation of temperature exposures. Uniquely, our products consist of inorganic and organic combinatorial chemistry that causes them to bond chemically with the substrate, whether metal, cement-based, or organic (e.g. plastics). By utilizing covalent bonding that penetrates into the substrate and reacts directly with the free ion within, the otherwise resulting disbondment is avoided. The result is a much longer lasting and stronger coating, and, in turn, a longer life for the substrate that has been treated.
 
With an addition of only 1-3 thousandths of an inch in surface thickness (depending on which product is used), no loss of either hardness, on the one hand, or pliability, on the other, and no reduction in photon (light) penetration, the platform technology – either on its own or when coupled with any of an array of available proprietary formula additives – offers the following unique combination of beneficial protective, maintenance-reducing, performance-enhancing and cosmetically-enhancing properties to most surfaces, including metals, plastics, paints, fabrics, vinyl, wood, masonry, or concrete, in each case without regard to temperature, climate or most other environmental conditions, without hazard to either human, animal or plant health/life, and for a period of up to as many as approximately 15-20 years:

Certain of the Science Behind Our Technology 
 
The most unique feature shared by our coatings is a slight positive surface charge they possess once applied. For certain of our coatings products, it is this slight positive surface charge that is responsible for their most unique and valuable properties identified above, including the hydrophobicity, oleophobicity, microbial and fungal resistance, dust-repellance, and enhanced hydrodynamics.
 
Hydrophobicity is a term largely unfamiliar to many outside scientific circles, but that describes a quality with which most everybody has a basic familiarity. Surfaces may be characterized as either hydrophilic or hydrophobic depending on whether or not they attract or repel water or other water-based liquids. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces are abundant in both nature as well as in synthetic materials, and they exist both organically and inorganically in terms of chemical composition. A hydrophilic surface can be wet and may adsorb water; a hydrophobic surface cannot and will not – it is compositionally incapable of becoming wet. An example of a hydrophilic surface encountered routinely in daily life are sponges, which, of course, readily soak up whatever water with which they come into contact, at least to the point of saturation. Hydrophobic materials and coatings, by contrast, prevent water from pooling on their surfaces. In scientific terms, hybrophobicity is caused by surfaces that disrupt the hydrogen bonding in water; so as to minimize the disruption in its molecular makeup, the water droplet pushes itself away from the surface to minimize its contact area, thus becoming very tightly bound. Hydrophobic materials are generally easy to identify because water forms into droplets upon contact with them after which they tend to roll around freely, like marbles on a flat Formica countertop, as occurs commonly on the freshly waxed exterior of a car or recently cleaned windshield with new wiper blades. The more hydrophobic the material (all the way up to and including so-called “superhydrophobic” surfaces), the stronger this effect, until the water effectively floats or skims across the surface with what amounts to very low friction. Naturally occurring hydrophobic surfaces include many species of plant leaves and flower petals, as well as many types of bird feathers and the outer body parts of a variety of insects; the lotus leaf is among the most hydrophobic of naturally occurring hydrophobic surfaces. Synthetic hydrophobic surfaces include such household-name brands as Scotchgard™ treated fabric, Teflon® coated metal, or Rain-X® coated glass.
 
Oleophobicity is a property very comparable to hydrophobicity, but it relates to oil-repellancy, not water-repellancy. There are important technical differences, but, for practical and basic observational purposes, they are very similar.

In terms of chemistry, our platform smart surface, and the coating variations identified above for which it serves as a basis, are inorganic, formed as they are of chemically “grown” glass. The process by which they form upon application can be likened to the process, witnessed by many daily in science classrooms, labs, or at home with popular science kits, whereby quartz crystals are effectively “grown” in a solution. This is important because it results in the establishment of a uniquely firm chemical bond between the coating and the surface, far stronger than would exist through either a mechanical or light bonding (the traditional alternatives), fundamentally setting the coatings apart from most others. When coupled with the unusually thin layer they inhabit – approximately 1-3 thousandths of an inch – the combination of properties leaves them notably flexible, permitting their use in connection with such items as fabrics, plastics, and pliable floor-boards, yet hard, durable, and resilient, particularly when refined with select additives.
 
The additives used in our various coating formulations available to customers fall into three basic categories. In the first category are color tints, which, in recent years, have seen major technology advancements in terms of durability, variety and depth of color, reflectivity, and fade-resistance. We have available to us a wide range of the most advanced offerings in this regard. In the second category are additives intended to provide increased hardness and wear-resistance. Here, too, we have access to what we believe are some of the most superior materials available. In the third category are EPA-approved, “on-contact” mechanical microbial germ and virus (so-called) “quat” (industrial and commercial quaternary ammonium) killers. These additives work in such a way as to prohibit the mutation of microbials which can otherwise become resistant over time to chemical kill mechanisms such as antibiotics and are capable of fortifying any of our coatings with additional protection against bacteria and relatively large viruses/microbials, including, for example, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (more commonly known as “MRSA), Clostridium difficile bacterial infection (more commonly known as “C-diff”), and Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (more commonly known as “H1N1” or “Swine Flu”). By combining our coatings – which, based on their positive surface charge, already powerfully discourage the growth of many of the smaller, more common viruses which can exist between active elements of existing “on-contact” killers (such as the Norovirus, for example, a concern long plaguing the vacation cruise ship industry) – with a quat and certain other additives available to us, a unique, broader spectrum of microbial protection is afforded.
 
Product Applications and Markets
 
With the array of beneficial properties identified above, certain but not all of which have been independently lab-tested and verified, the range of potential applications of our specialty coatings is notably far-reaching, spanning across numerous industrial, commercial, and household segments. While we are currently focusing our pursuit almost exclusively on only one of these potential applications, and there can be no assurance that we will ever directly pursue any one or more of the others, through an ongoing process of selection since we acquired the base technologies in 2014, we have identified certain of these potential markets as worthy of further exploration and possible commercialization by us over time. These determinations have been based principally in each case on the following criteria:

▪ | the relative size, age and projected growth trend of the subject market 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | the experience, observational/anecdotal intelligence, and testing results previously obtained in relation to the application
▪ | the relative strength of the value proposition to prospective customers 
▪ | the comparative time-to-market 
▪ | the comparative cost-to-market coupled with the extent of our existing industry relationships and available resources 
▪ | the relative geographic accessibility of the market 
▪ | the seasonality of the market, if any 
▪ | the relative barriers-to-entry within the market 
▪ | the relative, projected length of the particular sales cycle 
▪ | the projected gross profit margins 
▪ | both the presence within the subject market, together with the relative quality, of meaningfully competitive products, and 
▪ | the relative size and strength of the individual competitors

Through an analysis that relied on the above criteria, and though we have not commissioned or otherwise undertaken or obtained any comprehensive market study in respect of any one or more of the above-listed potential product applications, the select vertical markets which we have identified as worthy of our further pursuit include the following:
 

▪ | Interior Flooring and Exterior Tile, Pavers and Other Hardscapes 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | Industrial and Residential HVAC Equipment, Commercial Refrigeration Systems, and Power Generators
▪ | Automobiles and Motorcycles 
▪ | Vessels and Marine Infrastructure 
▪ | Heavy Trucks and Construction Equipment/Vehicles 
▪ | Oil, Gas & Mining Infrastructure/Equipment 

 
The following is a brief overview of each of the foregoing market verticals, certain of our initiatives in advancing our commercialization of them, and the general status of our involvement in relation thereto, in each case as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:
 

▪ | Interior Flooring and Exterior Tile, Pavers and Hardscapes. This is the market segment involving surfaces consisting, on the interior side, of engineered wood, laminates, resilient flooring (including vinyl composition tile [“VCT”], luxury vinyl tile [“LVT”], luxury vinyl plank [“LVP”], solid vinyl tile [“SVT”], vinyl sheet, linoleum, and wood plastic composite [“WPC”]), polished concrete, poured-on-site terrazzo, ceramic, porcelain and terrazzo tile, natural stone, and bathroom tile and grout, and, on the exterior side, of poured and stamped polished concrete, poured-on-site terrazzo, pavers, ceramic, porcelain and terrazzo tile, natural stone, brick and engineered wood. It has been targeted by us based on a broad combination of all of the factors identified above, and, as the focal point of our current business plan, is discussed in much greater depth below. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Industrial and Residential HVAC Equipment, Commercial Refrigeration Systems, and Power Generators. This is the market segment application consisting of coatings for HVAC and commercial refrigeration systems intended to serve as protection from corrosion, including in salt water, acid, alkaline and chemical environments, and from clogging by particles of mold, pollen, dust, and soot. Substantial testing in this area by a variety of industry participants has shown that there is a significant efficiency loss factor on these types of units due to natural oxidation and the restricted airflow resulting from dirt build-up on the condenser coils. With a product that repels moisture and contaminants, improves surrounding air quality, controls corrosion and reduces unit degradation – even in the hottest and most corrosive environments and climates – thereby meaningfully extending new or used unit life, offers increased operating/energy efficiency by decreasing aggregate kilowatt hours and thereby reducing energy consumption costs up to 12-20% over the life of a subject condensing unit, and substantially reduces maintenance requirements, management believes a significant opportunity exists for the Company within this market. Accordingly, we have invested considerably in pursuing these applications in our product development and commercialization initiatives to date, and, in 2018, we entered into an exclusive North American and Caribbean distribution rights arrangement for HVAC and refrigeration with a third-party applicator group and from which we expect, although there can be no assurance, to realize ongoing, fixed-rate recurring revenue for an indeterminate period based on our continued manufacturing and sale of product. Through this group, our RexPro HVAC coatings are increasingly being featured on units manufactured by Carrier, Bryant, Daikin, Panasonic, Rheem, Trane, and Ruud, among others.

▪ | Automobiles and Motorcycles. This is the market segment application consisting of coatings for the restoration-to-new-looking, preservation and protection of automobile and motorcycle exteriors, and for which we believe we have developed a uniquely valuable product. Until recently, we owned the patent rights to the underlying formula associated with that product. During the first quarter of 2019, however, we assigned our rights under such patent to a third-party which we believe intends to private label the product and from which, although there can be no assurance, we expect to realize ongoing, fixed-rate recurring revenue for an indeterminate period commencing sometime in 2019 based on our continued contract manufacturing of it, and sale to, them.

▪ | Vessels and Marine Infrastructure. This is the market segment application consisting of coatings for the restoration-to-new-looking, preservation and protection of boats/vessels as well as all kinds of marine-based infrastructure such as docks, and industrial scaffolds and rigs. Following a period of material product modifications to overcome certain performance issues (principally surrounding the gradual yellowing of treated surfaces), we believe we have developed a uniquely valuable, market-ready product for this market and we are currently exploring potential third-party distribution opportunities through which to sell and from which, if and when established, we would derive recurring revenue from manufacturing. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Heavy Trucks and Construction Equipment/Vehicles. This is the market segment application involving foundational heavy terrain construction equipment fleets and individual units. It comprises a wide range of vehicles in the heavy construction industry, including gators, bulldozers, excavators, dump trucks, cement mixers, and other, similar types of equipment in relation to which our coatings offer strong prevention against rust, oxidation, corrosion and abrasion breakdown. We believe that our coatings could result in notably significant savings in maintenance costs as well as extended life for these types of equipment/vehicles used in these highly corrosive environments. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and although there can be no assurance that it will continue, we are currently generating recurring revenue from a single re-manufacturer customer and periodic revenue from sales to other customers within this vertical market. Following certain performance setbacks and failures during testing with concrete trucks in recent years, we are also continuing with late-stage research and development initiatives aimed at further improving the performance quality of our product in this large and growing vertical. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Oil and Gas Drilling, Mining and Related Heavy Equipment. This is the market segment application surrounding a vast array of opportunities to sell certain of our coatings to prevent rust, oxidation, corrosion and abrasion breakdown in the oil, gas and mining industries. We believe that our coatings could result in notably significant savings in maintenance costs as well as extended life for equipment, tools, and infrastructure used in these highly corrosive environments. In this market segment, our coatings can be used as protective pipe linings and as a protective barrier on the exteriors of storage tanks, micro-turbines, hydraulic systems, fleet vehicles, rail cars and shipping containers. Based on recent industry reports, and with industrial coatings generally comprising more than approximately a third of the worldwide aggregate coatings market, the oil and gas segment is one viewed by us as holding some of the greatest growth potential. Based on certain results of early-stage field and lab tests conducted by prospective customers, and though there can be no assurance, management believes the effectiveness of its products for this purpose is already higher than many competing products, and that the market and demand for these products is potentially very significant. As available resources permit, we intend to actively target and pursue potential distribution and/or licensing opportunities of our market-ready product in this vertical through select industry operators.

SHIFT IN LONG-TERM STRATEGIC DIRECTION: 
 FOCUS ON INTERIOR FLOORING AND EXTERIOR HARDSCAPE COATINGS AND VERTICALLY INTEGRATE INTO APPLICATIONS SERVICES FOR THOSE PRODUCTS
 
Having taken control in 2014 of the variety of thematic coating chemistries and related business opportunities discussed above, management was faced with the challenge of sorting through them and making determinations as to which the company would pursue itself, when and how to go about the process for those it determined to pursue itself, which made sense for the company to off-load to licensee or distribution partners, or to simply convey outright through assignment but potentially manufacture for the assignee, and how in each case to make the most of, and from, these various arrangements.

Largely to the exclusion of many of the other opportunities we have to potentially pursue, and owing to a variety of strategic determinations that have been made by us in recent months coupled with a substantial revision to our business plan, our RexPro interior flooring and exterior tile, paver and hardscape line of coatings products is our current focal point in terms of business development, including our own, direct marketing and sales. Further, we have determined to extend our coatings business in this market to not only include product manufacturing and distribution, but also, in a meaningful departure from our historical operations, to vertically integrate by expanding into the applications services side of the business. These strategic determinations and the resultant material change in our going-forward business plan were arrived at on the basis of the following observations made, data accumulated, and related conclusions reached, in each case by management over the past several years:
 

▪ | Due to the amount of physical product used in the periodic maintenance process being a relatively minor component in the overall cost of applications servicing, the overwhelming volume of gross revenue in the industry goes to those performing the applications, not those making and selling the product to be applied
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Our interior flooring and exterior tile, paver and other hardscape products are demonstrated and proven (including by many nationally recognized brands), getting very positive reception in the market, viewed by some participants in the industry with a well-developed knowledge of the market as the ‘best-in-class,’ and are able to be sold by us at notably high gross margins
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Market demand for these products and related maintenance services tends to be price-inelastic (i.e. it does not fluctuate much in response to price movement in either direction)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | The “special services” aspect of the applications services business – the part encompassing relatively specialized services requiring expertise in something more than standard, nightly cleaning/janitorial services, and including interior flooring and exterior tile, paver and hardscape servicing – is highly fragmented, and, to at least some degree because it is specialized and requires a relatively higher skill labor, the gross margins realizable in the special services aspect of the applications services business are believed by us to be comparable to those realizable in our relatively high margin product manufacturing and distribution aspect
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | The applications services business has relatively low client acquisition costs (offset to some degree, however, by correspondingly low industry-wide client retention rates despite the presence of certain inevitable switching costs)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Due to the basic necessity of the products and related maintenance services for property owners, managers and tenants, the industry is highly recession-proof
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Dependence on a universe of untrained, wholly-independent contractors to perform applications presents an array of very challenging issues in terms of efficiently growing our business
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Because of their relative efficacy, our interior flooring and exterior tile, paver and other hardscape products often result in a net reduction in the necessity for applications frequency, thereby incentivizing property owners, property managers and tenants/lessees to use it much more than independent contractor service providers (who make more money generally by performing more services), and by selling the applications services ourselves (directly to property owners, property managers and tenants/lessees, that is), we are likely to have much more influence over those product purchase decisions
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Although the challenges in causing a product to stand out in a crowded field are many, even when the product is better (at least arguably) in most qualities than most of the other leading products, one way to potentially and meaningfully reduce the difficulty could be selling it as part of a fast-growing service operation that delivers those benefits because they are effectively ‘baked into’ the overall value delivered
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | In relation to some of the other vertical opportunities available to us, further product research, development and testing, or market research and receptivity-analysis, needs to be conducted
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Our internal knowledge, experience and contacts in the other verticals to which our products apply are not currently as well-developed as they are in the interior flooring and exterior tile, paver and other hardscape vertical, but we can leverage our technology assets through partnering with others better equipped than ourselves to pursue those markets, and in order to maximize our chances for success, our financial and human resources are most productively allocated for the time being on a single vertical, at least for the most part
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although we believe that we are adequately prepared to experience success if and when we complete a required, substantial and near-term financing, especially given our control over our proprietary products, our decision to vertically integrate by entering the applications services aspect of the flooring and hardscape coatings industry represents a major shift in our business, and one in relation to which we have no direct experience and only limited indirect experience, and we must for this reason be viewed properly as a start-up venture in this aspect of our business, which we are depending on becoming a major aspect.
 
Industry
 
The following depicts a basic breakdown of the interior flooring and exterior tile, paver and other hardscape products industry, and explains where it is that our products fit within the scheme.
Products Overview
 
The commercial flooring and hardscape coatings industry can be viewed in terms of two basic categories: interior flooring products and exterior hardscape products. In general, the interior flooring products category breaks out into floor waxes, on the one hand, and floor finishes, on the other. Categorically, exterior hardscape products are all just varieties of surface finishes.
 
Floor waxes are generally made with Carnauba wax, a natural base extracted from the leaves of Brazilian palm trees, but often combined to varying degrees with polyacrylics, polyurethanes or epoxies to result in what are effectively organic wax synthetics. Both floor finishes and exterior hardscape products, by contrast, are generally organic or inorganic synthetics primarily comprised of several components including acrylic, urethane, epoxy or siloxane polymers, alkali-soluble resins, surfactants, plasticizers and wax emulsion.
 
Natural Wax Finishes v. Organic and Inorganic Synthetic Finishes
 
Both natural wax finishes and organic and inorganic synthetic (commonly referred to – often mistakenly – as “acrylic”) finishes can be very effective in serving the maintenance needs of property owners, managers and tenants. Natural wax finishes are the more traditional option, with synthetics having come along more recently, but rapidly gaining market share, and for good reason.
 
The most notable difference between wax finishes and synthetic finishes is the maintenance required to sustain the finish. Whereas wax finishes need to be periodically stripped and reapplied due to foot-traffic, hand-trucks and other inventory transport units in order to retain their efficacy as protective coatings – and burnished (i.e. polished and buffed) regularly in order to sustain their visual appeal – such requirements are substantially reduced or in some cases eliminated altogether for synthetic finishes. Synthetic finishes are generally viewed as being stronger and more durable.

Organic and Inorganic Synthetic Finishes
 
Organic and inorganic synthetic finishes generally share a number of common constituents. These include the following:
 

▪ | Acrylic, urethane, epoxy or siloxane polymers are different types of particles or solids in the finish that give it the strength and durability against foot traffic and resilience to dirt getting ground into the finish. A higher concentration of solids makes for a more durable finish. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Alkali-soluble resins are the component that allows the finish to self-level, giving the finish an even coat. This enables the finish to set in less time and makes it easier to strip when it comes time to refinish the floor. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Surfactants are another constituent that play an integral role in ensuring even coats. They do this by helping the finish spread evenly across the floor. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Plasticizers act as a hardener of the surface, keeping the finish from cracking once it has set.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Wax emulsion is used to affect the glossiness, hardness and slip-resistance of the finish. Synthetic wax emulsion has been increasingly used in many floor finishes as a substitute for the natural carnauba waxes traditionally used in floor wax. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Synthetic finishes are generally composed of one of three constituent bases: water, solvent or siloxane. Our RexPro products are siloxane-based.
 
Waxes and Synthetic Finishes: Basic Product Purposes
 
In general, products in our category are used for purposes of obtaining the following:
 

▪ | Lasting enhanced appearance and odor elimination
--+-------------------------------------------------
▪ | Health, safety and anti-microbial cleanliness 
▪ | Protection against high-traffic wear-‘n-tear 
▪ | Slip-resistance and related liability mitigation
▪ | Reduced maintenance costs 
▪ | Substrate durability and longevity 

 
The leading products are generally those that do more or all of these things more effectively than others, and that do so more easily than others by requiring lower frequency maintenance. Up to a point, price-sensitivity is not a major factor in the purchase-decision because the best products are generally more effective and, when used, lead over time to reduced maintenance costs.
 
The Market
 
Strictly with respect to our RexPro interior flooring products and applications, we serve an industry that finished 2017 with combined new product sales in the United States of approximately $10.5 billion. This included resilient flooring, laminates, hardwood, and tile products, but does not include polished concrete, which is not technically a floor-covering but is another substrate in relation to which we consider our products to be high-value and which is rapidly growing in popularity among all of our targeted major customer-client groups.
 
Of note, the floor-covering product categories identified above (resilient flooring, laminates and tile) that are the fastest-growing, and increasingly taking market share from carpet and rugs, are also the categories which largely constitute the substrate surfaces for purposes of our own category of long-term surface protectants in relation to which we believe our products are best suited and proving to be most effective.
 
In general, our products can be viewed as having their highest value in relation to any property that is associated with relatively high foot-traffic. Specifically, and among others, they apply to all of the categories of properties listed below:

Current users of our interior flooring and exterior hardscape products include Hilton, The United States Veteran’s Administration (hospitals), Walmart, Wegmans, Food Lion, Best Western, Marriott, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Florida East Coast Railway and Duke University, among many other less recognizable names. Entities currently in testing or otherwise experimenting with our products in these verticals include Budweiser, The Ohio State University, and Studio Movie Grill, also among many other less recognizable names.
 
Interior Flooring and Exterior Hardscape Coatings: Competitive Products
 
Although there are dozens of others, there are certain products we consider to be our most serious competition in each of the interior and exterior categories. For interior surface (flooring) products, these include NeverStrip, Epic, Adsil MicroGuard, EcoProcote, ETS 180, and SaniGLAZE. For exterior surface (hardscape) products, these include Black Diamond, Epic, Adsil MicroGuard, Endura, Valspar, Rock Solid and Glaze-‘n-Seal.
 
We believe that our products compete very effectively in both of the above categories. While in respect of some product attributes, we may be found to perform less favorably than some competitive products, we do not believe that the degree to which that conclusion is true is material, and, in contrast, we do believe that, when taken as a whole, our products offer the most complete variety of superior attributes.
 
While there exists considerable overlap in qualitative attributes, the type of surface involved generally dictates customer’s priorities in terms of defining value and overall superiority, and ultimately driving purchase decisions. In order of relative importance, and depending on the surface type, it is our belief based on experience in the market that those priorities can be generalized as follows for these surfaces, which constitute a large percentage of our sales:
 

Hardscapes | VCT and Other Resilient Flooring | Tile and Grout 
----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lasting Aesthetic Renewal and Stain-Resistance | Cost-Savings Due To Longevity | Lasting Odor Elimination 
Slip-Resistance / Liability | Lasting Aesthetic Enhancement and Stain-Resistance | Lasting Aesthetic Enhancement and Stain-Resistance 
Enhanced Toughness/Strength Against Foot Traffic Wear-‘n-Tear | Sanitary Antimicrobial Resistance To Bacteria, Mold and Mildew Growth | Sanitary Antimicrobial Resistance To Bacteria, Mold and Mildew Growth
Sanitary Antimicrobial Resistance To Bacteria, Mold and Mildew Growth | Slip-Resistance / Liability Mitigation | Slip-Resistance / Liability Mitigation 
Toughness/Strength/Durability | Toughness/Strength/Durability | Toughness/Strength/Durability 
Cost-Savings Due To Longevity | Lasting Odor Elimination | Cost-Savings Due To Longevity 

 
When considered collectively, we believe that our products are among the highest-performing and most effective in the market with respect to all of these attributes. When considered individually, we believe that, with respect to some of the attributes, we are the single best performer.
 
The attributes that cause contractors to make a purchase decision in our category includes all of the same attributes considered important to property owners, managers and tenants/lessees. As a group, however, and generally, we believe that contractors will also place a high degree of importance on each of the following, all of which relate to ease-of-application, and in relation to which we consider ourselves meaningfully superior in the marketplace:
 

▪ | Pot-life (which is the length of time that the product remains useful following catalyzation, thereby reducing product loss factor and enabling margin preservation)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | Compressed dry-time (which enables expedited applications at locations with short daily closure periods, such as fast food restaurants) 
▪ | Substrate versatility (which simplifies process decision-making and can serve to increase product sales for manufacturers across unrelated applications) 

 
With respect to large square-footage applications, most of which in our markets involve resilient flooring in general and VCT in particular, the potential cost-savings to the property owner or tenant associated with the use of one product over others can be a significant factor in the purchase decision. The reason for this is that the potential cost-savings can be very substantial over time. Although there can be no assurance, we believe that, when compared to traditional wax floor finishing products (which are widely used across all types of properties currently), and based on reasonable cost assumptions, use of our V-Shield™ product (our designated product intended for use on vinyl flooring) can reduce maintenance costs by as much as 60-70% over a five-year period.

Management believes that the combination of the above product attributes, when coupled with the trade secrets underlying our product formulations, positions the Company to be able to benefit from certain market pricing power in relation to our interior flooring and exterior tile, paver and hardscape coatings products.
 
APPLICATIONS SERVICES
 
Industry Basics
 
The maintenance services industry can be viewed in terms of two groups, both of which – as a practical matter because of the way the contracting opportunities present themselves – overlap to some degree with one another:

▪ | Janitorial/Cleaning. This group comprises those service professionals that perform standard, relatively routine and low-skill, commoditized (and thus low wage/margin), daily/nightly cleaning services. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Special Services. This group, in contrast, comprises those service professionals that perform more specialized, relatively higher-skill, less price-sensitive (and thus higher wage/margin) periodic services, including floor finishing and bathroom tile and grout maintenance. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Vertical Integration Strategy
 
Our recently adopted strategy involves our vertically integrating our interior flooring and exterior hardscape surface products business through the development of an extensive North American network of fully-trained and qualified, affiliated but quasi-independent, special services contract applicators that are called upon by the company on an as-needed basis to perform product applications services for client-customer accounts established, maintained and controlled directly by the company through its regional business units.
Regional Operating Units and Service Applications Contracting Work
 
Our plan, currently being implemented, albeit incrementally, is to divide the U.S. and Canada into a number of regional districts, each of which will be operated as a distinct business unit by a regional operating unit manager with ultimate applications management responsibility for jobs performed within its respective geographic territory, as well as overall unit P&L responsibility. Current plans call for our regional operating unit managers to receive, in addition to salary, incentive compensation that entitles them to profit-sharing with other regional business units as well cash bonuses based on individual business unit performance (that rewards increases in free cash flow and return on invested capital [“ROIC”], and charges and credits them for capital deployment and returns relative to a set hurdle rate).
 
Upon intake of a given applications work order, management at the regional operating unit level assembles from its database pool of trained applicators a job crew consisting of a crew leader, whose responsibility it will be to manage the job, and an appropriate number of supporting crew members given the size and other requirements of the job. Current plans call for our individual job crew leaders to receive incentive compensation in the form of cash bonuses per job based upon meeting margin objectives relative to pro-forma job P&L and by reference to objectively established target benchmarks for:
 

▪ | Number of Square Feet 
--+--------------------------------------------------
▪ | Level of Job Complexity 
▪ | Number of Trained Service Applicators in Job Crew
▪ | Total Number of Job Crew Man-Hours 
▪ | Total Cost of Materials 
▪ | Quality Grade Upon Completion 
▪ | Pre-Bonus Project Profit Margin 


- 13 -
------


The database pool of trained applicators shall have been gradually developed over time through recruiting initiatives of prospects by the regional operating unit managers, and their subsequent and satisfactory attendance at the company’s centralized training facility in South Florida. Prospective network participants are expected to be recruited primarily from the following categorical sources/groups:
 

▪ | National commercial cleaning/janitorial franchises 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | Very large national commercial cleaning/janitorial non-franchise operators 
▪ | Large and mid-size regional commercial cleaning/janitorial non-franchise operators 
▪ | Large, affiliated networks and associations of independent contractors 
▪ | Local commercial cleaning/janitorial non-franchise operators (ranging from one and two-man operations, including mom-‘n-pop operators, to small companies)
▪ | Relatively small, regional or local affiliated networks and associations of independent contractors 
▪ | Specialty commercial hard-surface restoration and service providers 

 
In the early stages of developing our applications services network, we expect to rely to varying degrees on certain members of our existing, experienced project management team and crew members to travel to job sites throughout the U.S. and Canada to perform the required applications services or to support others that have been brought in by us to form the nucleus of a developing regional team.
 
We currently have over fifty go-to crews throughout North America with whom we have existing contacts and to whom we can turn to for recruitment opportunities as well as support in performing service jobs in the corresponding area, at least during the early-going as we’re developing our own network.
 
Applications Services Training
 
Training and certifying all network applicators is essential to our success. Challenges like high employee turnover, confusing products and complicated procedures can make it difficult to effectively train even the most promising candidates and keep our business running smoothly.
 
We currently train our recruits either at our centralized training facility in South Florida, or, if and when necessary and circumstances permit, at other locations more local to their base of activity. Training is conducted by our senior-most applicator professionals, each of whom have extensive experience both in the industry at large and with our RexPro products in particular. In order to be eligible to work on one of our crews, applicator trainees must complete the training program to the satisfaction of his/her trainer.
 
Although largely in a planning and developmental stage at this time, we expect to increasingly rely on the use of technology to support our training initiatives and programs. This includes extensive online instructional video content as well as downloadable forms for processing job administration, all designed for ease-of-review on handheld devices.
 
Applications Services NextGen: Robotics
 
Although strictly in the earliest, conceptual stages of exploration, and although there can be no assurance, management intends over time to introduce the use of robotics into its flooring and hardscape applications services operations. While such a move would likely result in a substantial increase in recurring capital expense, it is management’s belief that, once streamlined, if at all, it would also contribute significantly to bolstering gross profit margins through decreases in unit (labor) costs coupled with increases in unit productivity.
Sales
 
A core element of our recently revised business plan is to leverage both direct and distribution sales channels to aggressively expand key referral-based product adoption and market share in multiple geographic locations. We are currently in the process of attempting to identify an appropriate sales consulting firm to conduct a fundamental review of our sales operations, processes and team members, and deliver a detailed roll-out and growth plan, including a hiring agenda and onboarding model that outlines a systematic and replicable process to ensure development of consistent, high-end sales capabilities, as well as a playbook for sales training and development. In the meantime, however, it is expected by us to largely build upon conclusions reached to date.

- 14 -
------


Direct sales throughout the State of Florida and the Southeastern U.S. more generally is rapidly developing as a notable revenue stream that additionally serves as a local test-bed for sales best practices and intelligence-gathering. Expansion into other areas, including, for example, a developing presence in the Northeastern U.S., is already also well underway, as is the identification of a handful of other targeted regions across the U.S. believed by us to eventually serve as strategic hubs. Each region will include a team comprised of business development, sales, and marketing professionals. It is management’s view that the likelihood of successful expansion throughout the entirety of North America will be dependent on a focus by us on those regions that share two primary criteria:
 

▪ | they are statistically demonstrable hotbeds of relatively rapid population and industrial/retail growth; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | they are characterized by a relatively high presence of “key influencers” vis-à-vis RexPro brand/technology endorsement (“key influencers” being defined as those individuals or organizations in a target market identified by us to be among those to whom we have proven our RexPro solutions to be effective, and with whom we have developed a relationship that manifests as active endorsement of our products’ performances, value, and applicability to other potential customers within their sphere of influence [typically, but not invariably, existing and active local flooring or other contractors]).

 
As available working capital permits, our sales organization will include three separate levels, a continental group, a number of regional teams, and a number of local teams. The continental team’s responsibility will be to target and sell to both U.S. national-scale and Canadian national-scale accounts. The regional teams’ responsibilities will be to target and sell to regional accounts headquartered in the team’s regional domain. The local teams’ responsibilities will be to target and sell to local accounts operating within the team’s local domain.
 
Although there can be no assurance, and generally, we expect our account executives, as well as our sales managers, to be compensated through a combination of a base salary and commission. The commission will consist of some sliding percentage of gross receipts on jobs performed based on profit margin achieved, and be split in some way between the account executive and the corresponding sales manager. Further, these individuals remain entitled to a continuing interest in such commissions for work performed for each account going forward but only for so long as they remain with the Company. In applying this structure, management’s aim is to incentivize both individuals involved to build up a portfolio of recurring account work over time, and to remain with the Company for a long time.
 
Account Acquisitions
 
In addition to building sales through organic channels, we intend to actively and aggressively pursue business development through the acquisition of existing accounts from service contractors that control them wherever opportunities present themselves to build value on the way in. Specifically, and although there can be no assurance, this means discipline in buying any such accounts only at attractive purchase prices that will be accretive to our per share value, whether paid in cash or shares of our stock.
Contracts
 
Wherever our negotiating leverage permits, and whether derived organically through traditional sales initiatives or acquired from another service provider, we attempt to enter into long-term service agreements with our clients that will provide us in each case with a value-generating source of recurring revenue.

Certain Business Focal Points
 
Revenue Sources
 
Although there can be no assurance of either mix or volume, and based on our revised business plan, we expect to derive recurring revenue from each of the following:

▪ | The performance of interior flooring and exterior hardscape applications services 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | Sales of our interior flooring and exterior hardscape product beyond that sold as part of our applications services 
▪ | Sales of our other vertical market coatings to licensees, distributors, private-label resellers, remanufacturers and other users, including those for HVAC and refrigeration units, power generators, automobiles and motorcycles, vessels and marine infrastructure, heavy trucks and construction equipment/vehicles, oil, gas and mining infrastructure/equipment 

Revenue Drivers
 
Management believes that our future revenues will be largely dependent upon the following key factors:
 

▪ | The growth rate in the number and size of client-customer accounts (as determined through a combination of sales headcount, quota and productivity rates in relation to meeting quota) 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | Our client retention rate 
▪ | The degree to which our product is superior in the market, our product mix and our product pricing 
▪ | Our applications pricing 

Gross Profit Margin Drivers
 
Management believes that our future gross profit margins will be largely dependent upon the following key factors:
 

▪ | The existence of product pricing power 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | Our lack of dependence on unaffiliated general contractors for crew labor on our applications 
▪ | Our ability to benefit from economies of scale in materials purchasing 
▪ | The frequency of our working capital turns 

Cost Drivers
 
Management believes that our future costs structure will be largely dependent upon the following key factors:
 

▪ | Our cost of applications services crew labor, which will be materially affected by the extent to which we are reliant on unaffiliated general contractors 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | Our ability to benefit from economies of scale in materials purchasing 
▪ | Our applications services labor efficiency 
▪ | The rates at which we experience application mishap incidents, and the severity of such mishap 

Product Manufacturing and Fulfillment
 
We currently conduct all manufacturing and fulfillment operations on our own at our facility in Lake Park, FL. Though production capacity is currently limited, we intend to expand in-house capacity in the near future, subject to our having available to us the requisite capital investment. The manufacturing process is comprised largely of combining and blending raw materials and chemicals, including additives, in each case consistent with our proprietary formulations, and bottling of final product into labeled, quart, gallon and larger containers. In general, on-hand inventory is kept to a minimum and built up based on forecasted immediate- to near-term sales.
 
Due to financial constraints, we are often unable to buy raw materials in quantities that allow us to efficiently allocate our available capital. Specifically, we are often faced with having to purchase such materials in bulk sizes that are larger than we have an immediate-term need for and which results in our having to tie up more working capital in inventory than is maximally efficient from a capital allocation perspective. Although there can be no assurance that we will free of ourselves of this inefficiency, we do believe that the steady availability of adequate working capital, which has been absent for many years, would enable us to overcome this operational handicap.
 

- 16 -
------

Product Order Backlog 
 
In general, we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders and do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Accordingly, we do not believe that backlog information is material to an understanding of our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or other metric of financial performance.
Product Warranties and Returns Policies
 
Our product returns policies and warranties differ materially based on the type of surface to which we are informed our products are being applied, as well as the anticipated performance life of the particular product.
 
In general, we maintain a consistent return policy relative to any products in relation to which there is either no associated installation or, if there is an installation involved, it is one in which we have no participation or for which we have any responsibility. The policy under such circumstances requires that the subject products be returned unopened within no more than 30 days of purchase, and that all shipping charges associated with the return be borne by the customer. For a period of up to five years from purchase, a warranty is extended in such cases to customers relative to both the chemical integrity (as represented upon sale) and the performance integrity of the coatings based on the specific characteristics of the subject product and application, and the corresponding representations made by us in relation thereto.
 
Our returns policies and product warranties are general policies and warranties and are subject to change in relation to any particular sale. Further, the general policies and warranties themselves are subject to change from time to time and are likely to evolve as our operations and revenues develop.
 
                Applications Services Warranties 


While still in the early stages of development, our services warranties are likely to be offered in three or more tiers depending on the level of service purchased and the business type and level of foot or vehicle traffic on the area of application. For example, a first tier application services warranty for a customer that wants only the initial application and no maintenance follow up in a medium-to-heavy traffic office building might range from one to three years and cover only product replacement costs but not labor, whereas a tier three application services warranty might last five years or longer for a customer that subscribes to routine preventive maintenance calls and periodic heavy traffic area reapplication services. An example of a heavy traffic area would be the checkout line areas of a grocery store.
Research and Development
 
Though a substantial and growing percentage of our operating expense, our RexPro research and development (“R&D”) has been very modest in recent years, in real dollar terms, due to a lack of allocable funds. The limited R&D activities that have been pursued over this period have been conducted exclusively in-house.
 
Our RexPro R&D objective is to leverage our unique, integrated, emerging science capabilities to drive revenue and margin growth. Our R&D initiatives are principally focused on our strategic priority of achieving a leadership position across the relatively higher margin, science-driven segments of the specialized coatings and surfaces markets in which it operates by developing and refining differentiated, advanced industrial and related coatings and surface materials. We believe that our specialized scientific expertise, together with our developing R&D program, combine to provide us with distinctive, competitive advantages that position us to establish broad global reach over time and deep market penetration in our market verticals.
 
Our RexPro R&D team consists of one full-time employee and one part-time personnel.
 
We continue to protect our R&D investments and assets through pursuit of a comprehensive intellectual property strategy. See discussion under “Intellectual Property.”

Regulatory and Environmental Compliance 
 
Our coatings products business is subject to an extensive array of stringent regulations arising under a broad range of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws relating to the generation, storage, handling, discharge, disposition and stewardship of hazardous wastes and other harmful materials. These regulations have potential implications for us in terms of our manufacturing operations, product handling and use by customers and agents, as well as installation processes. In this regard, we will likely have to expend substantial amounts to comply with such laws and regulations as well as establish and maintain an evolving set of policies to minimize and control our environmental discharge and emissions. Nevertheless, legislative, regulatory and economic uncertainties (including existing and potential laws and regulations pertaining to climate change) may make it difficult for us to project future spending for these purposes and, if there is an acceleration in new regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend substantial additional funds to remain in compliance.
 
Our applications services operations are subject to various federal, state, and/or local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, such as discharge into soil, water, and air, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and hazardous substances. We expect that, from time to time, we will be involved in environmental matters at certain of our locations or in connection with our operations. Although there can be no assurance, we do not anticipate that the cost of complying with environmental laws or resolving environmental issues relating to locations or operations in in North America to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
 
Coatings Products Industry Competition 
 
Product performance, technology, cost-effectiveness, quality and technical and customer service are major competitive factors in the industrial and flooring coatings businesses. While, as discussed elsewhere, we are aware of a variety of products that share some of the attributes as our own, including some in our interior flooring and exterior hardscape categories, we are unaware of any one or more products possessing the identical combination of physical properties, and that, on the whole, offers exactly the same array of benefits, as our proprietary line of specialty coatings. There can be no assurance, however, that there’s not products under development or already in existence and in the early stages of market introduction of which management is not yet aware. The market for industrial and product performance coatings is extremely large, broad in scope, and consists of many different segments and sub-segments, each of which involves a range of product applications. It is also increasingly characterized by rapidly evolving technology. Precisely because of the wide array of beneficial properties they possess, the specialty coatings produced and distributed by us should be viewed as competing with other coatings products across a wide variety of the various existing market segments and sub-segments. Hydrophobic, anti-corrosion and antimicrobial coatings, for example, are each segments in which numerous companies are aggressively competing with one another worldwide, both in terms of technology and market share, but that, combined, represent only a minor portion of the aggregate competition that we should be viewed as meaningfully confronting.
 
The competition faced by us in relation to our proprietary line of specialty coatings includes both public and private organizations and collaborations among academic institutions and large companies, both domestic and foreign, most of which have significantly greater experience and financial resources than us. We expect that our most significant competitors, at least in some verticals, will tend to be larger, more established companies, including many major multinational corporations such as Akzo Nobel N.V., PPG Industries, Inc., Axalta Coating Systems, and Valspar Corporation. In general, these companies are all developing products that, at some level or in one or more ways, compete with ours and, in addition to many existing issued and pending patents, they have significantly greater capital and other resources available to them for research and development, testing, seeking and obtaining any required regulatory approvals, marketing and distribution. In addition, many smaller coatings have formed strategic alliances or collaborative arrangements, partnerships, and other types of joint ventures with larger, well-established industry competitors that afford these companies’ potential research and development and commercialization advantages, and may be aided in becoming significant competitors through rapid evolution of new technologies. Academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private dedicated research organizations are also financing and conducting research and development activities that could result in the introduction of products directly competitive to our own.
 

- 18 -
------

Interior Flooring and Exterior Hardscape Applications Services Competition 
 
We believe that each aspect of our applications services business will prove highly competitive and that such competition will be based primarily on price, quality of service, efficiency enhancements, ability to adapt to changing workplace conditions, and ability to anticipate and respond to industry changes. Although we believe that the quality and developing reputation of our proprietary products that we apply in connection with our services will serve to facilitate meaningful and durable competitive advantages in establishing and maintaining client accounts, we are proceeding on the basis of our conservatively arrived at assumption that a majority of our potential services revenue will be driven by prospective accounts requiring competitive bids, and that invitations to bid will often be conditioned upon prior experience, industry presence and demonstrated expertise, and financial strength, all factors in relation to which we should be expected to be at a meaningful competitive disadvantage. The low cost of entry in the facility services business results in a very competitive market. We expect to compete largely with regional and local owner-operated companies that may have more acute vision into local markets and significantly lower labor and overhead costs, providing them with competitive advantages in those regards. We also expect to compete indirectly with companies that can perform for themselves one or more services that we do not provide.
Intellectual Property
 
The competitive environment in which we operate is largely driven by technology, proprietary or otherwise. In general, companies in this environment seek to develop competitive advantages – both offensive and defensive – through the obtaining and maintaining of relevant patents and trade secrets (“intellectual property” or “IP”) relating to their respective technological advancements. As a science and technology based company, we believe that securing intellectual property is an important part of protecting our research and development.
 
Our IP strategy has been arrived at after extensive consideration of the relevant factors associated with both trade secret and potential patent protection. Given the meaningful disadvantages occasioned by the pursuit and/or issuance of potential patents on our technologies, coupled with the practical realities surrounding policing concerns thereafter, the strategy settled upon is one which relies strictly, at least for the time being and foreseeable future, on the protection and maintenance of trade secrets, and does not involve the pursuit of any patents, either in the United States or elsewhere.
 
Our core advanced coatings products’ unique competitive advantages are protected by closely-guarded trade secrets consisting of proprietary chemistry and formulations. In this regard, trade secrets play an important part in our intellectual property strategy, and we vigilantly seek to protect them. To protect our proprietary position in trade secrets, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators with access to our technology to enter into confidentiality and invention ownership agreements with us. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure. Further, in the absence of patent protection, competitors who independently develop substantially equivalent technology, or otherwise acquire it, may adversely impact our business. If and when we discover that any trade secrets have been misappropriated, it is expected that we will, unless we otherwise determine for strategic or similar reasons, report the matter to governmental authorities for investigation and potential criminal action, as appropriate. In addition, and to the extent that we have the available financial resources, we intend to take all reasonably required measures in an effort to mitigate any potential adverse economic impact, which may include civil actions seeking redress, restitution and/or damages based on losses sustained by us and/or unjust enrichment by a counter-party.
 
The fields in which we operate have been characterized by significant efforts by competitors in recent years to establish dominant or blocking patent rights to gain a competitive advantage, and by considerable differences of opinion as to the value and legal legitimacy of competitors’ purported patent rights and the technologies they actually utilize in their businesses. There can be no assurance that we will not be victimized by such aggressive initiatives and deliberate disputes.
 

- 19 -
------


It is possible that competitors in both the United States and foreign countries, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may have applied for, or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents, which will have an adverse impact on our ability to make and sell our products. There can also be no assurance that competitors will not reverse engineer any one or more of our formulations, or will not claim that we are infringing on their patents. Defense and prosecution of patent infringement suits, even if successful, are both costly and time consuming. An adverse outcome in the defense of a patent infringement suit could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or potentially even require us to cease our operations.
 
ADVANCED CEMENT SCIENCES 
 
Advanced Cement Sciences, LLC (“ACS”) is a Florida-based, development-stage company that acquired and owns certain intellectual property aimed at the production of advanced concrete and stucco admixtures and that consists principally of a combination of unique, proprietary formulations and production processes. ACS is in the process of developing and commercializing an array of application-specific products that rely on this technology, each of which are at a different stage of research and development, on the one hand, or very early commercialization, on the other.
 
ACS has not, to date, generated anything beyond nominal revenues despite it being a venture that our management had been very actively involved in developing since 2016 and into which we have invested significantly. Due to a lack of available company financial resources, coupled with its lack of near-term prospects for generating material revenue, ACS has been the subject in recent months of considerably reduced allocations of our available capital and human resources, a trend we expect to continue unless and until our financial condition substantially improves.
 
Technology
 
The ACS core technology centers around what are believed by management to be two meaningfully proprietary advances in concrete materials engineering:
 

▪ | Industrial chemistry formulations that result in multi-functional, high-performance concrete and stucco end-products that possess physical, flexural, chemical, and structural properties believed by management to potentially be unparalleled in their respective U.S. domestic and global markets. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | Methodologies for the custom blending, bonding and assimilation of base catalytic chemistries with a variety of industrial nanofibers and nanoparticles such that the net results are concrete and stucco end-products carrying a broad array of application-specific, custom-enhanced properties and high-performance characteristics.

 
Taken as a whole, we believe that our ACS platform technology is not merely a finite assortment of formulations from which certain useful products have been derived, but rather an evolving continuum of custom-blended concrete and stucco admixture variations subtly adaptable to meet a broad array of specific industrial applications and needs.
 
ACS is achieving results in the performance and other characteristics of its nano-engineered catalytic chemistry that management believes may prove unparalleled in a variety of ways. It is doing this by using internally developed, largely unconventional and proprietary combinations of materials and chemistry, including advanced compound assimilation methodologies believed by us to be unique to ACS.
 
Beyond its unique and proprietary concrete and stucco admixture formulations themselves, ACS has additionally developed an advanced product delivery system not otherwise known by us to be utilized in the industry that dramatically simplifies the process associated with mixing and preparing end-product, the purpose of which is to render the process much more mistake-proof than it might otherwise be. ACS’s “AdPacks,” named for their novel combining of the concrete industry admixture concept with that of a pre-mixed, ready-to-go package, contain a dense, viscous cake-mix style assortment of pre-measured and combined contents constituting a base product which, when combined on a production line or job site with cement, water and most commonly used concrete or stucco aggregates in accordance with provided instructions and supplemental videos, results in an end-product with notably superior characteristics for its particular purposes. It is management’s goal to make the ACS AdPacks available in off-the-shelf SKUs as well as custom formulations, and can be delivered in bag-sizes, totes or drums to meet quantity requirements at all industry levels.

Products and Markets
 
ACS is currently developing and, to varying degrees, commercializing, three distinct AdMix product lines:
 

▪ | Ultra-Lightweight Concrete Dry AdMix (AdPack) 
--+----------------------------------------------------
▪ | High-Performance Stucco Dry AdMix (AdPack) 
▪ | Ultra-Lightweight Concrete Block Dry AdMix (AdPack)

 
ACS has not, to date, generated anything beyond nominal revenues from any developed product lines.
 
Our Ultra-Lightweight Concrete Dry AdMix and High-Performance Stucco Dry AdMix are each believed by us to be ready at this time for commercialization and market introduction, subject to a variety of questions that remain unresolved, particularly those associated with continuing uncertainties surrounding the following, among others:
 

▪ | the long-term performance characteristics and durability of the products, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | the lack to date of having completed comprehensive industry-standard testing of such products, 
▪ | market sizes, 
▪ | market receptivity, 
▪ | market penetration rates, 
▪ | the attainability and sustainability of targeted market price points for such products in order to achieve established benchmark minimum gross margin thresholds, and 
▪ | the degree to which stockpiling speculative inventory will be necessary during the early-going sales period to meet customer demand if and when it materializes and develops.

 
Despite these continuing uncertainties, sales of our proprietary ACS Ultra-Lightweight Concrete Dry Admix have begun to a company with which ACS is affiliated (through common ownership with one of the beneficial owners from whom we recently acquired the remaining interest in ACS that we had not previously owned), United Stone, LLC, and that is currently selling precast decorative lightweight “manufactured stone” end-product that it is producing with our product. Notably, the end-user customer on these orders is Lennar Corporation, a very large homebuilder operating throughout the U.S.
 
Other applications for our Ultra-Lightweight Concrete Dry Admix are currently subject to continuing research, development and testing, including fire-resistant hollow-core panels, and other pre-cast construction panels and materials, for which the potentially definable construction markets are each global and massive by any sales volume standard.
 
Our Ultra-Lightweight Concrete Block Dry AdMix remains for the time being subject to continuing research, development and testing. We are cautiously optimistic regarding the prospects for this product, however, given the enormity of the global market potential within the construction sector and the uniquely valuable fire-resistant properties we believe that we can achieve and eventually be able to claim coupled with the substantially reduced weight of these units relative to the standard, ubiquitous units being sold worldwide in this category. 
 
At the broadest industrial level, and at each of the U.S. domestic and global levels, there are two basic customer categories within the concrete and stucco family of products, both of which ACS intends to serve:
 

▪ | Manufacturers who rely on concrete to make precast products they sell for use by property owners, developers, contractors, and builders; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | Developers, contractors and builders who rely on ready-mix or mix-on-site concrete and stucco for pour-in-place and tilt-up construction projects they develop, manage, and build.

With end-product that tends to be very bulky, heavy and prone to breakage in transport, and with only minor exception, those in the first group are believed by management to naturally covet a concrete that is many times lighter in weight than standard concrete, and that features a flexural strength that preserves the integrity of their product where it would otherwise fail (crack or break), but only if the cost of using it is meaningfully lower on a net, all-in basis. Although there are others, some of which are very large, initially targeted markets by ACS within this group include the following, in relation to which ACS believes it can most rapidly achieve meaningful revenue growth and market penetration:
 

▪ | Producers of concrete interior and exterior “manufactured stone” panels and veneers, architectural trim and decorative pieces (product: ACS Ultra-Lightweight [Design] Formula AdPack); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | Subject to completion of ongoing product development, concrete block (product: ACS Ultra-Lightweight Block Formula AdPack). 

 
With end-product that consumes vast amounts of concrete to achieve required compressive and tensile strength levels, those in the second group are believed by management to covet concrete and stucco materials that are substantially stronger than standard offerings, thus enabling the use of substantially less material to achieve comparable strength, but, here too, only if the cost of using it is meaningfully lower on a net, all-in basis. Although the largest markets within this group consist of those developers, contractors and builders using ready-mix or mix-on-site concrete for pour-in-place and tilt-up construction projects, and ACS intends to pursue those markets in time with products currently under development and testing, initially targeted markets by ACS within this group are limited solely to stucco, in relation to which ACS believes it can most rapidly achieve meaningful revenue growth and market penetration. For this vertical, ACS offers its Ultra-High-Performance Stucco Formula AdPack.
 
Sales initiatives for ACS product have been underway for over a year as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and such initiatives have been, intentionally due to production constraints, slow to develop and limited to those aimed strictly at the “manufactured stone” market and, more recently, the stucco market. Given the realities of new product introductions generally, and the need in the case of ACS products to not only evidence product compliance with existing building codes and related industrial standards, but also demonstrate product workability and efficacy through showcase projects, positive customer experiences, and industry expert references and endorsements, ACS is yet to achieve any meaningful degree of sales traction for either of those product lines and, to date, sales have been very limited and deliberately targeted towards customers that view their use of the product as part of a series of final-stage, semi-pilot projects. In the meantime, steady efforts have been underway towards enabling ACS’s ability to systematically provide evidence of product compliance with existing building codes and related industrial standards within identified markets, as well as to readily demonstrate product workability and efficacy through showcase projects, positive customer experiences, and industry expert references and endorsements within such markets.
 
Manufacturing and Marketing
 
To date, and beyond that associated with continuing product research and development, manufacturing and packaging of ACS product has been low-rate, batch only (i.e. non-automated). Systems design and planning for automated production and packaging are currently (and as they have been for some time now due to financing constraints) in the early stages of development, though implementation will be dependent on the availability of required financing. In the meantime, pursuit and acceptance of purchase orders has been and will necessarily continue to be constrained by very limited production capacity.
 
Subject to the availability of required financing and allocation by management, for which there can be no assurance, ACS’s 2-year manufacturing and marketing development plan is highlighted by the following key objectives:
 

▪ | implementing strategic intellectual property initiatives aimed at minimizing vulnerabilities for all product lines; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ | building out manufacturing capacity and operations for each of the Ultra-Lightweight Formula AdPack (including concrete block) as well as Ultra High-Performance Stucco Formula AdPack product lines;
▪ | building out the marketing and sales operations organization for those same product lines; and 
▪ | continuing R&D initiatives in respect of all product lines.

Historically, the handling of nanofibers and nanoparticles has been widely recognized as posing significant health and safety concerns and challenges stemming from the potentially hazardous particulates emitted into the air during the production, transport, and use of these materials. These emissions occur because, in the absence of industry-appropriate methods, processes and practices for the containment of otherwise loose, airborne particulates, such matter can get drawn into the eyes, the throat and lungs, and onto the skin, of those individuals handling or otherwise being exposed to these materials. Such exposure can lead to a variety of health and safety concerns. In relation to the production of those ACS admixture products that rely on the incorporation of nanoparticle-enhanced nanofibers, therefore, and although there can be no assurance that any safety precautions will prove reliable against any and all vulnerabilities in all instances, ACS has adopted and utilizes what it has deemed to be reasonably suitable methods and practices for the containment of these hazardous substances.
 
Backlog 
 
In general, ACS does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders and does not consider or expect backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Accordingly, we do not believe that ACS backlog information is material to an understanding of our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of ACS’s or our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or other metric of financial performance.
Intellectual Property
 
The only material asset of ACS existing as of the date hereof is the intellectual property underlying the ACS technology, the value of which remains highly speculative as of the date hereof, but the prospects for which offer potentially desirable returns for each of at least several applications in the event of successful product commercialization and market penetration/adoption at targeted price points. This intellectual property was acquired via irrevocable assignment by ACS in February of 2018 from the individual responsible for its development, Matthew Piazza, who has been independently consulting for ACS and is expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future, though there is not currently an agreement in place relating to Mr. Piazza’s services going forward. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement by which ACS acquired the subject technology from Mr. Piazza, ACS is obligated to pay to Mr. Piazza a percentage of all annually distributable income of ACS based on the gross profit margins of products sold by or for the account of ACS, and actually realized by ACS and not at any time recouped, in accordance with the following schedule:

Gross Margin Actually Realized By ACS | Percentage
------------------------------------------+-----------
Up To 35% | -0- 
35-45% | 1% 
45.01-55% | 2% 
55.10-65% | 3% 
65.01-75% | 4% 
75.01% or More | 5% 

 
Although there can be no assurances as to the discounted present or future value of our ACS technology, and despite our having been unable as a practical matter - due to prohibitive cost considerations given our current financial condition and unavailability of allocable cash - to obtain a professional, independent third-party valuation and/or fairness opinion, we have concluded based on our unique (though necessarily incomplete) knowledge of the relevant facts as a founding member since inception that ACS represents a uniquely worthy investment opportunity for us given the potential revenue-generating value of its intellectual property.
 
Our Historical Involvement With ACS
 
The Company was one of three founding members in ACS in September 2016. Following an equity restructuring of ACS that occurred in May 2017 that arose out of the agreed-upon departure from the enterprise of one of the founding technology firms and the addition of a new member that occurred in July 2017, until the series of transactions consummated on December 24, 2018, the venture was owned and controlled approximately 93% by its remaining two founding members, the Company and Nanotech Fibers, LLC, each of which have been actively involved in its development to date. Although ACS had been in a purely pre-revenue stage of development, our management team had been devoting a very significant percentage of its time to the business of this enterprise.

Since September 14, 2016, and for accounting purposes under FASB guidelines, ACS had constituted a variable interest entity of which the Company until recently owned a minority 31.05% economic interest and for which it had been considered the primary beneficiary among the equity participants based on qualitative and quantitative criteria. For this reason, we have been auditing and consolidating the financial statements of ACS together with our own since September 24, 2016.
 
Pursuant to an unwritten understanding among the then-members of ACS, we, as a significant stakeholder in ACS, began making expenditures on behalf of ACS in late 2016 because, as a practical matter, we had available funds to allocate and ACS was without other sources of available financing. Although it was never formally agreed to, the basic understanding among the members was that we would make expenditures on behalf of ACS that would be treated as a loan (though no interest rate was at any time specified). The reason it was never reduced to a formal written agreement was that working out the precise and definitive details of such agreement proved ultimately to be too challenging to be meaningfully effective on a prospective basis given the variety of materials, personnel services, facilities and other resources involved (shared and/or crossing over between the Company and ACS), coupled with the reality that the composition of such expenses was evolving continuously and rapidly. As of December 24, 2018, the date on which the series of transactions were consummated causing ACS to have become our wholly-owned subsidiary, ACS owed us $242,579 for expenditures we had incurred on behalf of ACS since September 14, 2016.
 
On December 24, 2018, and in a series of separate but related taxable transactions, the Company acquired the 68.95% economic – and 68.42% voting – interests not previously owned by it in ACS, resulting in the Company owning 100% of ACS as of the date hereof (and making it a wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiary). Prior to the consummation of these transactions, effected separately with each of the other four holders of membership interests in ACS, we had owned a 31.05% economic – and 31.58% minority voting – interest in ACS. In exchange for the acquisition by the Company of such combined membership interests, the Company issued to the holders thereof a combined total of 175,000,000 shares of Company common stock, including 57,458,335 shares, indirectly and through beneficial ownership, to our president and chief executive officer, Steven Malone, 57,458,333, also indirectly and through beneficial ownership, to our corporate and securities legal counsel, Michael Membrado, and 28,729,166, also indirectly and through beneficial ownership, to Mr. Piazza, the developer of the ACS technology. The agreements pursuant to which this series of transactions were consummated are included as Exhibits 10.50 – 10.53 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed December 31, 2018. In connection with the acquisition of this remaining percentage interest in ACS, each of the three incumbent managers of ACS resigned, effective immediately, and the Company designated itself as the manager of that entity, which now exists as our wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
COMBINED BUSINESSES
 
Significant Customers and Vendors
 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we generated a significant portion of our revenues from certain customers as follows:
 

 | % of Total Revenues
----------------------------------------+--------------------
Customer | 2018 | | 2017
Caribbean Energy Solutions, LLC. | | 18.44 | % | 0.45 | %
Springfield ReManufacturing Corp. (SRC) | | 13.64 | % | 7.50 | %
Permatect Facility Solutions | | 9.03 | % | 3.05 | %

During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our significant product and chemical raw material purchases were as follows:
 

 | % to Total Products
---------+--------------------
 | 2018 | | 2017 | 
Vendor A | 22.36 | % | — | 
Vendor B | 16.46 | % | 18.41 | %
Vendor C | 10.45 | % | 7.15 | %

 
We currently have no long-term written agreements with any of these vendors. The payment terms are generally net 30 days, and we are not substantially dependent upon any one or more of them; all are easily replaceable with any locally or nationally available supplier.
 
Corporate Formation, Legacy, History & Subsidiaries 
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 7, 1997 as EJH Entertainment, Inc. On December 4, 1997, a predecessor corporation with the same name as our own but domiciled in Idaho was merged with and into us. Although the predecessor Idaho corporation was without material assets or operations as of the time of the merger, since being organized in 1968, it had historically been involved in mining and entertainment businesses unrelated to our current business.
 
Beginning in 1997, and although we were not then a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act, our common stock was quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board (originally under the symbol “TIXX”, which was later changed to “TIXXD”). On May 13, 1999, we changed our name to FINdex.com, Inc. On March 7, 2000, in an effort to satisfy a then recently imposed NASD Rule eligibility requirement that companies quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board be fully reporting under the Securities Exchange Act (thereby requiring recently audited financial statements) and current in their filing obligations, we acquired, as part of a share exchange in which we issued 150,000 shares of our common stock, all of the outstanding capital stock of Reagan Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation. At the time of this transaction, Reagan Holdings was subject to the requirements of having to file reports pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act, had recently audited financial statements and was current in its reporting obligations. Having no operations, employees, revenues or other business plan at the time, however, it was a public shell company. As a result of this transaction, Reagan Holdings, Inc. became our wholly owned subsidiary and we became the successor issuer to Reagan Holdings for reporting purposes pursuant to Rule 12g-3 of the Securities Exchange Act. Shortly thereafter, we changed our stock symbol to “FIND.” Though it does not currently have any operations, employees, or revenues, Reagan Holdings remains our wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
In addition to Reagan Holdings, we also have one other wholly owned subsidiary, Findex.com, Inc. (i.e. the same name as our own), a Delaware corporation. Like Reagan Holdings, this entity, too, does not currently have any operations, employees, or revenues. This subsidiary resulted from an acquisition on April 30, 1999 pursuant to which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of FINdex Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation, from its then stockholders in exchange for 4,700,000 shares of our common stock, which, immediately following the transaction, represented 55% of our total outstanding common stock. Our purpose for this acquisition (under a previous management) was to broaden our then-existing stockholder base, an important factor in our effort to develop a strong market for our common stock. On May 12, 1999, in exchange for the issuance of 457,625 shares of FINdex Acquisition Corp. common stock, FINdex.com, Inc., another Delaware corporation (originally incorporated in December 1995 as FinSource, Ltd.), was merged with and into FINdex Acquisition Corp., with FINdex Acquisition Corp. remaining as the surviving entity. Our purpose for this merger (under a previous management) was to acquire a proprietary financial information search engine for the Internet which was to serve as the cornerstone for a Web-based development-stage business, but which has since been abandoned. As part of the certificate of merger relating to this transaction, FINdex Acquisition Corp. changed its name to FINdex.com, Inc. We currently own 4,700,000 shares of FINdex.com, Inc. (the Delaware corporation), representing 100% of its total outstanding common stock.

On July 23, 2014, we merged with EcoSmart Surface & Coating Technologies, Inc., a Florida corporation (“EcoSmart Florida”). Because, for accounting purposes, this merger was treated in accordance with ASC 805-40, Reverse Acquisitions, and Findex was recognized as the accounting acquiree in relation thereto with EcoSmart Florida as the accounting acquirer, our consolidated financial statements for the reporting period from January 1, 2013 through July 23, 2014 were those of EcoSmart Florida, not the enterprise historically recognized as Findex. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements for the periods since July 24, 2014, the day after which the merger was consummated, recognize Findex and EcoSmart Florida as a single operating enterprise and entity for accounting and reporting purposes, albeit with a carryover capital structure inherited from Findex (attributable to the legal structure of the transaction). Readers of this annual report on Form 10-K should note that, in order to provide materially relevant disclosure regarding certain of Findex’s historical, operational expenses not otherwise appropriately accounted for in our consolidated financial statements given the applied accounting treatment described herein, certain disclosure is contained in the text of this report relating to such expenses, including e.g. executive compensation, director compensation, and audit fees, that does not numerically align with the corresponding figures contained in our consolidated financial statements.
 
Prior to the merger with EcoSmart Florida, and since 1999, our business had been developing, publishing, marketing, distributing and direct-selling off-the-shelf consumer and organizational software products for the Windows platform. Following divestitures of two software titles which had consistently accounted for the overwhelming majority of our revenues while owned by us, including our Membership Plus product line, which we sold in late 2007, and our flagship QuickVerse product line, which we sold during 2011, and title acquisitions during the same period that, in the aggregate, had been relatively insignificant in offsetting the loss of revenues associated with those major divestitures, our continuing operations, while not nominal, had been very limited and insubstantial in terms of revenue, both relative to what they had been prior thereto and by any appropriate standalone measure. Specifically, our operations immediately prior to the merger with EcoSmart Florida consisted exclusively of those relating to the FormTool line of products which we acquired in February 2008, as well as two language tutorial products, which were retained after the sale of the QuickVerse product line. Due to a continuing lack of capital over a number of years, we were unable to meaningfully grow the FormTool line and develop related products, and our business and financial prospects became increasingly challenged. Since the merger with EcoSmart Florida, our primary focus has shifted away from the continued development of our FormTool line and much more intently in the direction of our surfaces and coatings business, where we believe the opportunities for our future growth are greater and have significantly more to offer economically.
 
In its most recent corporate form, EcoSmart Florida was organized in 2012. The patents (since assigned by us) and other intellectual property forming the foundation of the EcoSmart business were originally developed during a preceding period dating back to 2003 in which it was operated by the developers of the Company’s technologies as Surface Modification Technologies, Inc. (“SMT”), a Florida corporation, and EcoSmart, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, which were sold together to The Renewable Corporation, a Florida based company with its common stock then traded in the over-the-counter market (“TRC”) in 2012. On January 20, 2012, EcoSmart Coating Technologies, Inc., a Florida corporation, was organized as a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRC. Simultaneously, EcoSmart Surface Technologies, Inc., also a Florida corporation, was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of TRC. With common ownership by TRC, the assets of each of SMT and EcoSmart, LLC were thereafter transferred in part to EcoSmart Coating Technologies, Inc. with the remainder to EcoSmart Surface Technologies, Inc. On September 18, 2012, EcoSmart Surface Technologies, Inc. changed its name to EcoSmart Surface & Coating Technologies, Inc. On October 19, 2012, EcoSmart Coating Technologies, Inc. was merged with and into EcoSmart Surface & Coating Technologies, Inc., leaving EcoSmart Surface & Coating Technologies, Inc. as the surviving corporation.
 
ACS, a Florida limited liability company, is an engineered cement technology and products firm founded in mid-2016 and currently focused on developing and commercializing a line of proprietary admixtures to be used in the production of ultra-lightweight, high-strength concrete and high-performance stucco. Since September 14, 2016, and for accounting purposes under FASB guidelines, ACS had constituted a variable interest entity of which the Company until recently owned a minority 31.05% economic interest and for which it had been considered the primary beneficiary among the equity participants based on qualitative and quantitative criteria. On December 24, 2018, and in a series of separate but related taxable transactions, the Company acquired the 68.95% economic – and 68.42% voting – interests not previously owned by it in ACS, resulting in the Company owning 100% of ACS as of the date hereof (and making it a wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiary). Prior to the consummation of these transactions, effected separately with each of the other four holders of membership interests in ACS, we had owned a 31.05% economic – and 31.58% minority voting – interest in ACS. In exchange for the acquisition by the Company of such combined membership interests, the Company issued to the holders thereof a combined total of 175,000,000 shares of Company common stock.
