 Shared web hosting is a great option for startup or smaller businesses as the website sits on the same server with other websites and shares resources such as memory and Central Processing Unit (CPU). Basic website applications such as email and file sharing are ideal for shared server offerings.
  
 Virtual private servers
  
 Virtual private servers (VPS) is a step up from a shared hosting solution in that specific server resources are allocated directly for your use, assuring performance levels. This is a more secure and reliable option that separates your site from others and is ideal for storage or database applications for businesses, developers, and fast-growing sites.
  
 Dedicated servers
  
 Dedicated servers provide yet another level of security and performance for those who need more processing power or storage. Servers are built to customer specifications and tuned for performance, reliability and efficiency to meet the demand of more robust applications. Through Pair QuickServe (QS), a powerful hosting solution with tremendous capacity and speed, servers are ready for your use in no time and fully managed to keep them up to date.
  
 Pair hosting also offers self-managed service through server collocation, which delivers the advantages of the powerful infrastructure that was built behind the fully managed offerings. For those customers who want to purchase their own hardware, collocation service in Pair’s data center allows for unmanaged service with the security and reliability of the diverse network, physically secure facilities, backup power and redundant climate control.
