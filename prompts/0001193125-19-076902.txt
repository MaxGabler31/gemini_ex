Item 1. Business. 
Organization 
 All references to the Liquidating LLC refer to New York REIT Liquidating LLC and all references to we, us, our, or the Company refer to New York REIT Liquidating LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 New York REIT Liquidating LLC was formed on November 7, 2018 and is the successor in interest to New York REIT, Inc. (the Predecessor). The Predecessor was incorporated on October 6, 2009 as a Maryland corporation that qualified as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (REIT) beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2010. On April 15, 2014, the Predecessor listed its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol NYRT. 
 On August 22, 2016, the Predecessors Board of Directors (the Board) approved a plan of liquidation to sell in an orderly manner all or substantially all of the assets of the Predecessor and New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the OP) and to liquidate and dissolve the Predecessor and the OP (the Liquidation Plan), subject to stockholder approval. The Liquidation Plan was approved at a special meeting of stockholders on January 3, 2017. 
 As part of the Liquidation Plan and in order to comply with applicable tax laws, at a special meeting of stockholders on September 7, 2018, the stockholders approved the conversion of Predecessor from a Maryland corporation to a Delaware limited liability company and the delisting of Predecessors common stock from the NYSE (the Conversion). Liquidating LLC was formed upon the effectiveness of the Conversion at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on November 7, 2018. 
 Substantially all of the Predecessors business was conducted through its OP. Pursuant to the Liquidation Plan, all of the assets held by the OP have been sold, and the OP was dissolved prior to the Conversion on November 7, 2018. 
 As of December 31, 2018, the Companys only significant assets are a 50.1% equity interest in WWP Holdings LLC (WWP) which owns one property, aggregating 2.0 million rentable square feet, with an occupancy of 96.5%, and a $90.7 million cash reserve to be utilized for improvements at WWP. The Companys property consists of office space, retail space and a garage, representing 88%, 5% and 7%, respectively, of rentable square feet as of December 31, 2018. 
 As of February 28, 2019, the Company has sold all of its properties except for the remaining 50.1% interest in Worldwide Plaza. Also, as of February 28, 2019, the Company has paid aggregate cash liquidating distributions of $987.4 million, or $58.80 per unit of common membership. 
 The Predecessor had and the Company has no employees. Prior to March 8, 2017, the Predecessor retained (i) New York Recovery Advisors, LLC (the Former Advisor) to manage its affairs on a day-to-day basis and (ii) New York Recovery Properties, LLC (the ARG Property Manager) to serve as the Predecessors property manager, except for properties where services were performed by a third party. The Former Advisor and ARG Property Manager are under common control with AR Global Investments, LLC, (the Sponsor), which is the successor business to AR Capital, LLC (AR Global).

On March 8, 2017, the Predecessor transferred all advisory duties from the Former Advisor to Winthrop REIT Advisors, LLC (the Winthrop Advisor) and property management services with respect to properties managed by ARG Property Manager were transferred to Winthrop Management, L.P. (the Winthrop Property Manager). Since November 7, 2018, the Winthrop Advisor continues to manage our affairs on a day-to-day basis. The Winthrop Property Manager no longer manages any of our properties. 
 Under the Liquidation Plan, the Predecessor was not, and under our limited liability company agreement, we are not permitted to make any new investments except to make protective acquisitions or advances with respect to our existing assets. We are permitted to satisfy any existing contractual obligations and fund required tenant improvements and capital expenditures at our real estate property owned by the joint venture in which we own an interest. 
 The Liquidation Plan enables us to sell any and all of our assets without further approval of the unitholders and provides that liquidating distributions be made to the unitholders as determined by the Companys Board of Managers (the Board of Managers). 
 In October 2018, we announced the withdrawal of our common stock from listing on the NYSE in connection with the conversion. November 2, 2018 was the last day on which shares of our common stock were traded on the NYSE and our stock transfer books were closed as of 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on such date. At the effective time of the conversion, each outstanding share of common stock was converted into one unit of common membership interest in the Liquidating LLC (a Unit), and holders of shares of our common stock automatically received one unit (which unit was in book entry form) for each share of our common stock held by such stockholder. Holders of Units should note that unlike shares of our common stock, which, in addition to having been listed on the NYSE, were freely transferable, Units are not listed for trading and generally are not transferable except by will, intestate succession or operation of law. Therefore, the recipients of Units will not have the ability to realize any value from these interests except from distributions made by the Company, the timing of which will be solely in the discretion of the Board of Managers. On October 26, 2018, the Board designated Randolph C. Read, P. Sue Perrotty, Craig T. Bouchard, Howard Goldberg and Joe C. McKinney, representing all the previous members of the Board, to serve as the initial members of the Board of Managers. 
 The Company is deemed to be the same entity as the Predecessor with the same assets and liabilities as the Predecessor. In addition, the charter and bylaws of the Predecessor were replaced by the operating agreement of the Company. For tax purposes, the fair value of each Unit in the Company received by stockholders when the conversion became effective, which reflects the value of the remaining assets of the Company (net of liabilities), was $14.00 per unit and was equal to the average of the high and low trading prices for shares of the Predecessors common stock on the last three days on which the shares were traded on the NYSE. For a detailed description of the federal income tax and investment considerations relating to the conversion and its effects on our interests in the Predecessor, please see the Predecessors proxy statement/prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 6, 2018. 
 The business of the Company is the same as the business of the Predecessor immediately preceding the conversion, which, consistent with the Liquidation Plan, consists of the continued ownership of the Predecessors interest in Worldwide Plaza, the only remaining property-related asset. Under its operating agreement, the business and affairs of the Company will be managed by or under the direction of its Board of Managers, and the sole purpose is winding up the affairs of the Company and the liquidation of its remaining asset. The Company will remain in existence until the earlier of (i) the distribution of all its assets pursuant to liquidation or (ii) four years from the effective time of the conversion. The term may be extended to such later date as the Board of Managers determines is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes of the Company.

The dissolution process and the amount and timing of distributions to unitholders involves risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict the timing or aggregate amount which will be ultimately distributed to unitholders and no assurance can be given that the distributions will equal or exceed the estimate of net assets presented in the Consolidated Statement of Net Assets. 
 In March 2018, the Predecessor effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split (the Reverse Split) of its common stock (Common Shares) pursuant to which each of ten Common Shares issued and outstanding as of the close of market on March 15, 2018 were automatically combined into one Common Share, subject to the elimination of fractional shares. All references to Common Shares outstanding and per Common Share amounts have been restated to reflect the effect of the Reverse Split for all periods presented. Any fractional shares resulting from the Reverse Split were redeemed for cash in lieu of shares.

On December 20, 2016, the Company, through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the OP, entered into a mortgage loan (the Mortgage Loan) in the aggregate amount of $500.0 million and a mezzanine loan in the aggregate amount of $260.0 million (the Mezzanine Loan). The Mortgage Loan and the Mezzanine Loan are collectively referred to as the POL Loans. The POL Loans were initially secured directly, in the case of the mortgage loan, and indirectly in the case of the mezzanine loan, by our properties located in New York, New York at 245-249 West 17th Street, 333 West 34th Street, 216-218 West 18th Street, 50 Varick Street, 229 West 36th Street, 122 Greenwich Street, 350 West 42nd Street, 382-384 Bleecker Street, 350 Bleecker Street, 416-425 Washington Street, 33 West 56th Street and 120 West 57th Street (the POL Loan Properties). In April 2018, the POL Loans were fully satisfied, and all the POL Loan properties sold during 2017 and 2018 have been released and are no longer collateral for the POL Loans. 
Tax Status 
 The Predecessor operated in a market which qualified it as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), effective for our taxable year ended December 31, 2010 through November 7, 2018, the date of conversion. In order to qualify for taxation as a REIT we were generally required, among other things, to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and to comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements until the date of conversion. 
 The Liquidating LLC will be treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes. Accordingly, no provision or benefit for income taxes is made in the consolidated financial statements. All distributions from the Liquidating LLC in 2018 are considered a return of capital for tax purposes. Unitholders will receive a Schedule K-1 from the Liquidating LLC annually reflecting their allocable share of the Liquidating LLCs income, loss, gains and deductions. 
 Competition 
 The New York City real estate market is highly competitive and there are many competing properties in the New York MSA. With respect to the remaining asset that we own, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the propertys design to prospective tenants needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. Many competitors have substantially greater marketing budgets and financial resources than we do which could limit our success when we compete with them directly. Competition could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on property operating expenses. We also may compete with other entities advised or sponsored by affiliates of the Winthrop Advisor for tenants. 
 Subsequent to the adoption of the Liquidation Plan we have competition from other properties located in the New York City real estate market both from an operations perspective and with respect to the disposition of our property. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business and our net assets in liquidation. 
 Regulations 
 Our investment is subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investment.

Environmental 
 As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest. 
Employees 
 We have no employees. The employees of the Winthrop Advisor and their affiliates perform a full range of real estate services for us, including accounting, asset management and investor relations services. 
 We are dependent on these affiliates for services that are essential to us, including asset dispositions, asset management and other general administrative responsibilities. 
 Financial Information About Industry Segments 
 With the adoption of the Liquidation Plan, we have only one reporting segment subsequent to January 3, 2017.
