Sales made directly to U.S. Government agencies and entities, or indirectly through third party manufacturers utilizing Woodward parts and subassemblies, collectively represented % of our sales for fiscal year 2022 and 29% of our sales for fiscal year 2021. 

Seasonality
 We believe our sales, in total or in either reportable segment, are not subject to significant seasonal variation.  However, our sales have generally been lower in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to the immediately preceding quarter due to fewer working days resulting from the observance of various holidays and scheduled plant shutdowns for annual maintenance. 
Sales Order Backlog
 For each of our reportable segments, we have elected to quantify backlog in a manner consistent with the definition of remaining performance obligations. Our remaining performance obligations by segment, excluding material rights, as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 is shown in the table below.  

 | October 31, 2022 | | October 31, 2022 Percent Expected to be satisfied by September 30, 2023 | | October 31, 2021
-----------+------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+----+-----------------
Aerospace | $ | 1,198,571 | | 74 | % | $ | 1,009,101
Industrial | | 374,324 | | 94 | | | 261,074 
 | $ | 1,572,895 | | 79 | % | $ | 1,270,175

 
Our remaining performance obligations relate to the aggregate amount of the total contract transaction price of firm orders for which the performance obligation has not yet been recognized in revenue.  
 Manufacturing
 We operate manufacturing and assembly plants primarily in the United States, Europe and Asia. Our products consist of mechanical, electronic and electromechanical systems and components. 
 Aluminum, iron and steel are primary raw materials used to produce our mechanical components. Other commodities, such as gold, copper and nickel, are also used in the manufacture of our products, although in much smaller quantities. We purchase various goods, including component parts and services used in production, logistics and product development processes from third parties. Generally, there are numerous sources for the raw materials and components used in our products, which we believe are sufficiently available to meet current requirements.
 We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities' production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and efficiently managing our overall supply costs. We expect our suppliers to maintain adequate levels of quality raw materials and component parts, and to deliver such parts on a timely basis to support production of our various products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers intended to protect our intellectual property and processes and to monitor and mitigate risks of disruption in our supply base that could cause a business disruption to our production schedules or to our customers. The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, business continuity, quality, delivery and protection of our intellectual property and processes.
 Our customers expect us to maintain adequate levels of certain finished goods and certain component parts to support our warranty commitments and sales to our aftermarket customers, and to deliver such parts on a timely basis to support our customers’ standard and customary needs. We carry certain finished goods and component parts in inventory to meet these rapid delivery requirements of our customers. 
 Research and Development
 We finance our research and development activities primarily with our own funds. Our research and development costs include basic research, applied research, component and systems development, and concept formulation studies.  
 We collaborate closely with our customers as they develop their technology plans, which leads to new product concepts. We believe this collaboration allows us to develop technology, new systems, and products that are aligned with our customers’ needs and future performance, which increases the likelihood that our systems and components will be selected for inclusion in the platforms developed by our customers. Further, we believe our close collaboration with our customers during preliminary design stages allows us to provide products that deliver the component and system 
 5


performance necessary to bring greater value to our customers. This preliminary work may include opportunities to test new products in order to validate concepts and demonstrate performance in challenging environments. We strive to stay ahead of the competition through our modeling, prototyping, and state of the art test capabilities.  
 Aerospace is focused on developing systems and components that we believe will be instrumental in helping our customers achieve their objectives of lower fuel consumption, lighter weight, more efficient performance, reduced emissions, and improved operating economics. We support our engine and airframe customers as they develop next generation designs across the commercial aviation, general aviation, civil private and military markets. Our development efforts support technology for a wide range of:
  
• | aerospace turbine engine applications, which include commercial, business and military turbofan engines of various thrust classes, turboshaft engines and turboprop engines;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | electromechanical and hydraulic actuation systems for flight deck-to-flight surface control of fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft, and turbine engine nacelles, as well as guidance for weapon systems; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | motion control components for integration into comprehensive actuation systems.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Most technology development programs begin years before an expected entry to service, such as those for the next generation of commercial aircraft. Other development programs result in nearer-term product launches associated with new OEM offerings, product upgrades, or product replacements on existing programs.  
 We developed the fuel system, air management system, and actuation hardware for CFM International’s LEAP engine program. We also developed actuation system, combustion system and oil system components for Pratt & Whitney’s Geared Turbo Fan (“GTF” or “PurePower”) engine program. We continue to support GE and CFM for improvements to the LEAP fuel system, and Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney for improvements to the PurePower engine programs. 
 Industrial is focused on developing innovative technologies, including integrated control systems and system components, that enable our customers to cost-effectively meet mandated emissions regulations and fuel efficiency demands, allow for usage of a wider range of fuel sources, increase reliability (particularly in harsh environments), and reduce total cost of ownership. Our development efforts support technology for a wide range of:
  
• | products that improve the quality of combustion processes and provide more precise flow of various fuels and gases in our customers’ gas turbines and industrial reciprocating engines;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | electronic devices and software solutions that provide improved control and protection of reciprocating engines, gas turbines, steam turbines, and engine- and turbine-powered equipment; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | advanced prognostic and predictive intelligence that is integrated into many of our complex products and systems.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Human Capital 
 Our employees (whom we call “members”) are Woodward’s most valuable resource for current and future success.  We promote an environment that ensures safety, encourages diversity and inclusion, fosters growth and self-development, and provides meaningful work. All members participate in our success through attractive and aligned total rewards programs. Notable programs we offer to our full-time members include:

• | employer sponsored health insurance;
--+-------------------------------------


• | employer 401(k) matching contributions;
--+----------------------------------------


• | annual Woodward stock contributions for U.S. members;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | a tuition assistance program;
--+------------------------------


• | training and professional development courses through our Woodward University curriculum; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other values-based and technical development training
--+------------------------------------------------------

 Tenure of all employees averages nearly 11 years, reflective of our positive workplace culture. Our recruiting team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage and reward employee referrals for open positions.
 In addition to our comprehensive investment in our members’ success, we strive to maintain an inclusive environment that values and leverages the uniqueness of each member to the benefit of all our stakeholders. We view the combination of diverse perspectives and backgrounds as a powerful force for innovation. To promote diversity and our core principles, we emphasize dignity, value, and equality of all members, regardless of race, color, religion, age, gender or sexual 
 6


orientation, through our actions and the workplace training programs we provide. We continually strive to harness the diversity of our global workforce by cultivating a climate that permits all our members to bring their authentic selves to work every day.
 The health and safety of our members is also a top priority. We have implemented appropriate procedures and precautions to ensure the continued safety and well-being of members. We strive to comply with all federal and local workplace laws and regulations where we do business. We are always looking for ways to exceed compliance standards by utilizing continuous improvement discipline to proactively eliminate risks in the workplace.
 As of October 31, 2022, we employed approximately 8,300 full-time members of which approximately 2,500 were located outside of the United States, with the majority of such members located in Germany, Poland and China.  
 Member engagement drives better business results, and Woodward conducts biannual employee engagement surveys to give our members a voice in their work experience. In 2022, more than 68% of our members participated in our employee engagement surveys. These surveys help identify key engagement drivers at Woodward and areas where we have opportunity to improve. This has resulted in action plans at all levels of the organization and drives continuous conversations on the things that matter most to members and their teams. 
 In the United States, approximately 13% of our total full-time workforce were union members as of October 31, 2022. All union members in the United States work for our Aerospace segment. The collective bargaining agreements with our union members are generally renewed through contract renegotiation near the contract expiration dates. The MPC Employees Representative Union contract, which covered 710 members as of October 31, 2022, expires September 30, 2025. The Local Lodge 727-N International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers agreement, which covers 407 members as of October 31, 2022, expires April 23, 2024. 
 In Germany, approximately 12% of our total full-time workforce were union members as of October 31, 2022, all of whom work for our Industrial segment. Our Woodward L’Orange members are part of the IG Metall union in Germany. IG Metall covered 961 members as of October 31, 2022.
 We believe we have good, collaborative relationships with our union members and the representative unions. 
 Almost all of our other members in the United States were at-will members as of October 31, 2022, and therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. Our executive officers each have severance and change-in-control agreements which have been filed with the SEC.
 Outside of the United States, we enter into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary, including coordination through local works’ councils. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction.
 Patents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing
 We own numerous patents and other intellectual property, and have licenses for the use of patents and other intellectual property owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. Government has certain rights in our patents and other intellectual property developed in performance of certain government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes as allowed by law.  
 Intellectual property not covered by patents (or patent applications) includes trade secrets and other technological know-how that is not patentable or for which we have elected not to seek patent protection, including intellectual property relating to our manufacturing processes and engineering designs. Such unpatented technology, including research, development and engineering technical skills and know-how, as well as unpatented software, is important to our overall business and to the operations of each of our segments.  
 While our intellectual property assets taken together are important, we do not believe our business or either of our segments would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. 
 As of September 30, 2022, our Consolidated Balance Sheets includes $460,580 of net intangible assets. This value represents the carrying values, net of amortization, of certain assets acquired in various business acquisitions and does not purport to represent the fair value of our acquired intellectual property as of September 30, 2022.

Environmental Matters and Climate Change
 The Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. Compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or global competitive position.
 We use hazardous materials and/or regulated materials in our manufacturing operations. We also own, operate, have acquired, and may in the future acquire facilities that were formerly owned and operated by others that used such materials. We believe the risk that a significant release of regulated materials has occurred in the past or will occur in the future cannot be completely eliminated or prevented. From time to time, we engage in environmental remediation activities, generally in coordination with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. In addition, we may be exposed to other environmental costs including participation in superfund sites or other similar jurisdictional initiatives.  When it is reasonably probable that we will incur remediation costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for such future costs with a related charge against our earnings. In formulating that estimate and recognizing those costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies, or others, until such recovery is assured.  Currently, we have no sites undergoing remediation.  
 Our manufacturing facilities generally do not produce volumes or quantities of byproducts, including greenhouse gases, that would be considered hazardous waste or otherwise harmful to the environment. We do not expect legislation currently pending or expected in the next several years to have a significant negative impact on our operations in any of our segments. 
 Domestic and foreign legislative initiatives on emissions control, renewable energy, and climate change tend to favorably impact the sale of our energy control products. For example, our Industrial segment produces energy control products that help our customers maximize engine efficiency and minimize wasteful emissions, including greenhouse gases.
