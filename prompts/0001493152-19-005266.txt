Overview
 
“As water becomes ever more scant the world needs to conserve it, use it more efficiently and establish clear rights over who owns the stuff.” – Liquidity Crisis, The Economist, Nov 5, 2016
 
Since 2009, we have acquired strategic water assets and land in the Huerfano and Cucharas river basins in southeastern Colorado, thus the name Two Rivers. In October 2016 we began to focus on monetizing our assets by investing strategically in assets that we believe offer opportunities for significant future returns for our shareholders and by selling those assets we determine will not yield those returns. As the result of that process, the management of water has become our core business. Our water asset total drainage area spans over 1,500 square miles and drops in elevation from over 14,000 feet to 4,500 feet at the confluence of the Arkansas River just east of Pueblo, Colorado. We operate in a natural, gravity fed water alluvial, which is the last undeveloped basin along the front range of Colorado. As our first water-focused project, we plan to develop this basin to properly manage the water contained therein and serve the community while providing returns to our investors. Our water development operations and strategy are described below under “Our Water Operations.”
 
Beginning in February 2018, we opened discussions with a group of hemp related companies. Two Rivers desired to find a source of capital along with the ability to generate near-term revenue from the land and water assets owned by Two Rivers. Presently, Two Rivers has entered into a stock exchange agreement for the purchase of 100% of the three entities: Vaxa Global, LLC (“Vaxa”); Ekstrak Labs, LLC (“Ekstrak”), and Gramz Holdings, LLC (“Gramz”). Vaxa grows CBD hemp focused plants. Ekstrak extracts CBD oil. Gramz produces and sells CBD extract in the form of both isolate and full-spectrum oil within end-user products.
 
Our principal investments since commencing operations in 2009, and the status of those investments following the implementation of our monetization strategy in 2016, are described below:
 

● | HCIC: From 2009 to 2010 we purchased 95% of the outstanding shares of Huerfano-Cucharas Irrigation Company, or HCIC, in a series of transactions for $24.2 million in cash, promissory notes and Two Rivers’ common stock. HCIC is a mutual ditch company formed in 1944, and we have used its water rights and facilities to supply some of our farmland with irrigation water. In the future, we will use these water rights to supply water to farmland we lease to others and to implement our new water strategy.

● | Additional Farmland: From 2009 to 2011 we acquired 2,753 acres of farmland served by HCIC’s ditch system for purchase prices totaling $1.4 million in cash and seller carry back financing. In 2012 we acquired 1,584 acres in Butte Valley for $509,000 in cash and seller carry back financing. In 2016, we returned 187 acres around the Orlando land back to the holder of seller carry back financing in exchange for forgiveness on $187,000 of debt and associated accrued interest. 
● | Orlando: In 2011 we acquired Orlando Reservoir No. 2 Company, LLC, or Orlando, for $3.45 million in cash, promissory notes and common stock. Our ownership of Orlando increases the reliability of water supplies for our farmland in the Huerfano and Pueblo river basins. We undertook a program to refurbish and restore Orlando’s diversion structure, storage reservoirs and conveyance system. During the period from November 2011 to February 2012, we constructed new outlet works, and in 2012 we reconstructed the diversion structure, which takes water from the Huerfano River for storage in the Orlando reservoir and then conveyance to irrigate our nearby leased farmland. Additional renovation projects will be completed as necessary to provide reliable water supplies for farmland we lease to others and community use. 
● | DFP (discontinued operations): In 2012 we acquired Dionisio Farms & Produce, Inc., or DFP, for $3.4 million in cash and promissory notes. DFP, which has operated for more than 60 years, produces high-value fruits and vegetables as well as fodder crops. Through this acquisition, we obtained 146 acres of irrigable farmland, 146 shares of the Bessemer Ditch Irrigation Company, a senior water right holder on the main stem of the Arkansas River and 2 supplemental ground water wells. As part of the acquisition, we entered into leases for an additional 279 irrigable acres. In late 2016, based on three years of operational losses, we decided to sell DFP assets and wind down our produce growing and distribution business within Pueblo County. During the first quarter of 2017 we sold the DFP irrigated farmland and the associated DFP produce business that no longer served our strategic vision of water management

● | GrowCo (no longer consolidated effective April 1, 2018): We formed GrowCo, Inc., or GrowCo, in May 2014 for the purpose of constructing state-of-the-art computer-controlled greenhouses to be leased to licensed marijuana growers throughout the United States. GrowCo is not a licensed marijuana grower or retailer. GrowCo does not “touch the plant” and only provides growing infrastructure as a landlord for licensed marijuana grower tenants along with support and administrative services. In August 2014 we announced we were reserving 10 million of the GrowCo shares for distribution to holders of common stock as of four record dates (January 1, 2015; April 1, 2015; July 1, 2015 and October 1, 2015) after a registration statement for GrowCo common shares has been filed and declared effective, which has not yet occurred. Currently, GrowCo has approximately 35 million common shares outstanding. As of April 1, 2018, due to change of management and control, the Company no longer consolidates GrowCo.

● | Water Redevelopment: We formed Water Redevelopment Company, or Water Redev, in February 2017 to separate our water assets from the rest of our business and to enable additional raising of capital solely for the purpose of investing in our water assets. Water Redev is a subsidiary of Two Rivers and focuses on development and redevelopment of infrastructure for water management and delivery, as further described in “Our Water Operations” below. 

Our Water Operations
 
Colorado allocates water based on the Prior Appropriation Doctrine, whereby water rights are unconnected to land ownership. The first person to use a quantity of water from a water source for a beneficial use has the right to continue to use that quantity of water for that purpose. Subsequent users can use the remaining water for their own beneficial purposes provided that they do not impinge on the rights of previous users. Water rights can be developed, managed, purchased and sold much like real property, and the seniority of water rights are a significant consideration when we acquire additional irrigated farmland. Water rights include the ability to divert stream flow, build a storage reservoir, pump ground water and create augmentation water supplies to offset depletions of water taken out of priority.
 
Since 2009 we have acquired a portfolio of water rights in the Arkansas River Basin in connection with our purchases of irrigated farmland. With our initial marijuana greenhouse projects gaining traction, in the third quarter of 2016 we determined to investigate whether our water assets might have revenue potential of their own, separate from use in irrigating our farmland, that could benefit our stakeholders, including our shareholders and the communities near where our water assets are located.
 
As a result of that investigation, we made water management our top priority. We believe there are several opportunities to capitalize on water assets that we currently own or can acquire, in order to address serious storage and supply challenges faced by municipalities, ranches, farmlands and other commercial enterprises in the Arkansas River Basin. In order to address these opportunities, we have identified the following within the local communities we serve:
 

● | We will seek to address the need for municipal water storage. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We believe there are a variety of opportunities to lease, both short term and long term, our water assets. 
● | We have identified underutilized land that, along with the water we own, can be leased for agriculture activities. 
● | We plan to execute on a water supply agreement we entered into in January 2011, with a real estate development company in Huerfano County by beginning to supply raw water for water taps. 

 
Our principal water rights include the following:
 

● | As noted in “Overview” above, we acquired control of HCIC in order to use its water rights and facilities to supply some of our farmland with irrigation water. The HCIC farmland became fallow in the mid-twentieth century when coal mines in Huerfano County, Colorado, were shut down. The coal mines had continuously pumped water from the Vermejo/Trinidad Formation, which contained a renewable underground aquifer that is fed by Sangre de Cristo Mountains snowmelt. The U.S. Geological Service estimates that the Raton Vermejo Basin, where we have water rights, contains an estimated 12 trillion gallons or 36 million acre-feet of relatively untapped, clean and renewable water. HCIC owns the Cucharas and Huerfano Valley Reservoirs and two ditch systems located in Pueblo County, Colorado. The HCIC ditch systems have the right to distribute water over approximately 30,000 acres in Pueblo County, Colorado.

● | The Orlando water rights include the senior-most direct flow water right on the Huerfano River, or #1 priority, along with the #9 priority and miscellaneous junior water rights. The seniority of those water rights allowed the production of crops during most of the recent drought years. The Orlando assets also include the Orlando reservoir, which is situated on the Huerfano branch of the Huerfano River and has a storage capacity of 3,100 acre-feet. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
An acre-foot, or A.F., of water is the amount of water required to cover one acre to a depth of one foot. An acre-foot of water contains 325,851 gallons, generally considered enough water to supply two average households for a year. Annual irrigation in Southeastern Colorado, depending on the crops, consumes approximately three to six acre-feet of water per acre of crop.
 
By capturing water in reservoirs and releasing it later for irrigation purposes, we are able to retime the delivery of water throughout the irrigation season and ameliorate some of the inconsistencies of seasonal and annual water availability for the farmland we manage.
 
Surface Water Rights
 
Tributary ground water is any underground water that is hydraulically connected to a stream system and that influences the rate or direction of flow in that stream system. Any new ground water diversions that are tributary to an over-appropriated stream system require augmentation to offset out-of-priority depletions. In 2013, many well water users on the Arkansas River and its tributaries were unable to use their wells, as drought conditions made augmentation water unavailable. In response, an augmentation provider requested that we assist in building a more efficient and plentiful augmentation supply. We had intended to assist with an augmentation supply, but due to capital requirements, we terminated those plans.
 
We own the following surface water rights:
 

Structure | Elevation | | Priority No. | Appropriation Date | | Consumptive Use | | Decreed Amount 
--------------------------+-----------+--------------+------------------+------------------------+-----+---------------------+-----------+-------------------
Butte Valley Ditch | | 5,909 ft | | | 1 | | | 5/15/1862 | 360 A.F. | | 1.2 cfs 
Butte Valley Ditch | | | | 9 | | | 5/15/1865 | | | 1.8 cfs 
Butte Valley Ditch | | | | 86 | | | 5/15/1886 | | | 3.0 cfs 
Butte Valley Ditch | | | | 111 | | | 5/15/1886 | | | 3.0 cfs 
Robert Rice Ditch | | 5,725 ft | | | 19 | | | 3/01/1867 | 131 A.F. | | 3.0 cfs 
Orlando Canal No. 3 | | 5,911 ft | | | | | | 10/19/1906 | | | 
Huerfano Valley Ditch | | 4,894 ft | | | 120 | | | 2/2/1888 | 2,891 A.F. | | 42.0 cfs 
Huerfano Valley Ditch | | | | 342 | | | 5/1/1905 | | | 18.0 cfs 

 
“Consumptive use” is the term for the portion of a water diversion right that is actually consumed by its beneficial use. Where the beneficial use is agricultural irrigation, consumptive use represents the amount of water consumed by the irrigated crop or evaporated on the farm. After deducting consumptive use from the amount of water diverted and applied to irrigation, the remainder is described as “return flow” to the system. Such return flows are generally subject to appropriation downstream. Only the consumptive use portion of a given water right is subject to transfer (that is, a change in the point of diversion, place of use, or purpose of use). Therefore, water rights are often assigned monetary value based on the consumptive use portion. Although consumptive use varies by crop, rainfall, temperature and other factors, in southeastern Colorado, crops generally consume about two acre-feet of applied water for each acre planted, depending on the crops planted. In order to provide that amount of consumptive use water, an irrigator must generally apply three acre-feet of water (allowing for predictable return flow equal to about one-third of the applied water). We measure our water rights both in terms of the amount of the diversion or storage right, as the case may be, but also in terms of the historic consumptive use.

Storage Rights and Infrastructure
 
The following table presents our holdings of storage water rights:
 

Structure | Elevation | Priority No. | Appropriation Date | Average Annual Yield (A.F.) | | Decreed Amount (A.F.) | Estimate of Current Effective Storage (A.F.)

** | This is a conditional right while the engineering and construction of structures are completed to perfect a water right, in this case to physically store the water. The conditional right establishes a seniority date but allows time for completion of the project. Conditional rights are reviewed every six years by the water court to confirm that progress is being made on the effort to perfect the right. When a conditional water right is perfected, which can be done incrementally in the case of storage, the water right becomes absolute. In addition, the Cucharas Valley Reservoir has Conditional rights to 34,404 A.F. of additional storage. 

 
The Company, the State of Colorado (Office of the State Engineer and the local Division Engineer), and neighboring water rights holders have been involved in litigation in the Colorado Division 2 Water Court concerning water rights and claims by the State concerning an existing dam in Huerfano County, Colorado, and a demand by the State to breach the dam structure. (Two Rivers Water and Farming Co. vs. Welton Land and Water Co., Pueblo Water Court). As part of the litigation, Two Rivers sought to have certain water rights demands by the neighboring water rights holders deemed wasteful. The Company has withdrawn this suit with prejudice, and the Welton Land and Water Co. have been awarded $204,000 in legal fees that remain unpaid, which we have recognized in accrued expenses.
 
In the quarter ending March 31, 2016, Two Rivers entered into a stipulation agreement with the State, settling the State’s claims at that time. Under the stipulation agreement, Two Rivers agreed to take the existing dam structure down to the sediment level by March 31, 2018. Two Rivers was able to empty all the water in the Dam but was not able to meet the requirements of the agreement by March 31, 2018 due to lack of capital. On April 3, 2018, the State filed a motion for the issuance of a contempt of court citation against the Company, its then directors, and former director and CEO John McKowen, and certain other individuals for breach of the agreement seeking sanctions, imposition of a civil penalty of $100,000 and payment of legal fees. The Company and its then directors are contesting the sanctions sought in the contempt motion, based in part upon those sanctions being unnecessary and unduly punitive. Preliminary hearings for the defendants were held on May 10 and June 8, 2018. At the May 10, 2018 hearing it was determined that the State of Colorado could proceed with its action. At the June 8 hearing, a trial date of December 17, 2018 was set by the Court that was subsequently postponed to October 2019.
 
The Company intends to continue its efforts to seek funding so that it can comply with the agreement. In the three months ended December 31, 2018 the Colorado State Engineer (the “State”) began to take the existing dam down. This work was completed in January 2019. The State has estimated that the deconstruction work with associated fees and penalties is approximately $1,300,000. As of December 31, 2018 we have accrued a liability and other expenses of $1,800,000 for this work including a $185,000 fine to the County of Huerfano. At this time, the Company does not have funds to pay the State or the County the amounts due each but is actively seeking the required capital.
 
As part of our comprehensive water system we utilize storage reservoirs and ditches. Reservoirs allow water owners to store their water and plan the water’s distribution throughout the growing season. We currently own reservoirs associated with HCIC and Orlando. The development and improvement of storage reservoirs in the area will allow us to offer storage to other water users in the area for a storage leasing fee. Through water exchanges and other water-related transactions, the reservoirs can potentially increase and strengthen our existing water rights.

All of our reservoirs are used for irrigation in a similar manner to other reservoirs in the region, with the exception of Pueblo Reservoir, which was also constructed for flood control. Direct flow rights generally are senior to most storage rights but typically do not divert early in the spring when storage rights fill. The Arkansas River below Pueblo Reservoir operates a Winter Storage Program that re-allocates winter direct flow rights to storage in reservoirs from November 15 to March 15 each year.
 
Because our water rights and operating structures are located at succeeding elevations in the watershed, the system moves water supplies from point of diversion, through storage, to place of use primarily by means of gravity, making it more economical to operate than systems requiring energy to pump water for beneficial use.
 
In order to use these rights and structures most efficiently, we have planned and begun to implement a program of renovation and integration. For example, we began construction of new outlet works for the 1905 Orlando Reservoir in November 2011. The work was completed and successfully tested in February 2012, approximately a year after we acquired Orlando. Also in February 2012, we commenced reconstruction of the diversion structure, which takes water from the Huerfano River for storage in the Orlando reservoir, and to irrigate our nearby farmland. Additional water facility renovation projects are planned on a phased basis as necessary to provide reliable irrigation for agricultural operations and eventually commercial use.
 
We currently have the operable right to store 5,000 acre-feet of water within the Huerfano and Cucharas Rivers watershed in three separate reservoirs, subject to repair, or removal and rebuilding, limitations. When our reservoirs on the Huerfano and Cucharas Rivers have been fully restored, we will have the operable capacity and legal right to store in excess of 70,000 acre-feet of water. Similarly, based on our portfolio of water rights, we have the right to divert from the natural flows of the two rivers in excess of 90 cubic feet per second. Seasonal variability in the natural flow of the rivers, as well as the priorities of other water users in the system, limits our ability to divert the decreed amounts of water on a continuous basis. Our current water rights produce a long-term average annual diversion of 15,000 acre-feet of water.
 
The 15,000 acre-feet average is based on a record period of more than 50 years and also relies on historic studies of these rights by a variety of engineers at various times. It is common practice within the water industry in Colorado to use long periods of time to create reliable averages of water flow. We believe that using averages relating to only recent years can be misleading because an average could be skewed if only one of those years was particularly dry or wet. For example, in three out of the last ten years, there has been an extreme drought in our area of operations. Due to this drought condition, our flow averages for the most recent ten, five and three years are 8,200 acre-feet, 10,500 acre-feet and 10,400 acre-feet, respectfully. A similar request for the same averages for the decade beginning in 1980 would result in averages of 5,900 acre-feet, 18,500 acre-feet and 17,200 acre-feet. During 2017, which was a wet year, an estimated 50,000 acre-feet flowed through the Cucharas dam site. Normal flow through the Cucharas is approximately 22,000 acre-feet per year.
 
Formation of Water Redevelopment
 
In the third quarter of 2016 we determined to investigate whether our water assets might have revenue potential of their own, separate from use in irrigating farmland, that could benefit our stakeholders, including our shareholders and the communities near where our water assets are located. On September 30, 2016, our board of directors established a board-level task force to identify opportunities for our existing water assets, and perhaps acquired water assets. As a result of that investigation, water is a new top-priority for our Company.
 
Based on findings from our water task force, we believe we have several opportunities to capitalize on water assets that we currently own or can acquire, in order to address serious storage and supply challenges faced by municipalities, ranches, farmlands and other commercial enterprises in the Arkansas River Basin. In order to address these opportunities, we have identified the following:
 

● | We will seek to address the need for both agricultural and municipal water storage. As discussed in the 2015 Colorado Water Plan and its Executive Summary Colorado has set a goal of attaining an additional 400,000 acre feet of storage by 2050. (Board) 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We believe there are a variety of opportunities to lease, both short term and long term, our water assets. 
● | We have identified underutilized land and water that we own that could be used to lease to agricultural operators including growers of marijuana and hemp. 


Two Rivers Water & Farming Company | 2018 Financials | Page 5
-----------------------------------+-----------------+-------


● | In January 2011, we entered into a water supply agreement to supply water resources for real estate development in Huerfano County, Colorado. In late 2019 we intend to begin the development and legal process to begin to deliver raw water to this development. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Agreement to Purchase Companies – Subsequent Event
 
On February 22, 2019, we entered into a share exchange agreement pursuant to which we agreed to acquire the 100% membership interest in Vaxa Global, LLC, or Vaxa, from Easby Land & Cattle Company, LLC, or Easby, in exchange for 30,000,000 shares of our common stock and an earn-out arrangement for up to 20,000,000 additional shares of our common stock.
 
Vaxa owns a 100% membership interest in each of Ekstrak Labs LLC, (“Ekstrak”), and Gramz Holdings, LLC, (“Gramz”). Vaxa has been operating since 2014. Ekstrak has been operating since 2017. Gramz has been operating since 2015.
 

● | Vaxa grows CBD hemp focused plants. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Ekstrak extracts CBD hemp oil. 
● | Gramz produces and sells CBD extract in the form of both isolate and full-spectrum oil, compounds, such as Gramz Herbal Topical and Gramz Whole Plant Matrix Sublingual Drops, which has been developed to exploit the medicinal and therapeutic benefits of hemp. 

 
If the proposed acquisition is completed, we expect Vaxa will expand their operations to grow hemp on land owned, and with water supplied, by Two Rivers. This will provide additional hemp products to Ekstrak and Gramz.
 
We will issue to Easby a total of 30,000,000 shares of common stock at closing. In addition, we may be required to issue additional shares pursuant to an earn-out covenant in the share exchange agreement. The number of earn-out shares will equal the lesser of the quotient of (a) 10 times the consolidated earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of Vaxa (including Ekstrak and Gramz) for the year ending March 31, 2020 (or, if the parties agree to extend the required closing date to a date not later than July 15, 2020, the year ending June 30, 2020), divided by $1.00; and 20,000,000.
 
It is expected that the earn-out shares, if any, would be issued by May 2020 (or by August 2020, if the parties extend the closing date as described in the preceding sentence).
 
The closing must occur on or before April 15, 2019, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties. It is anticipated that an extension will be necessary and both parties will agree to an extension. The closing is subject to standard conditions, as well as a requirement that we enter into an agreement with holders of outstanding preferred units of TR Capital Partners, LLC, or TRCP, pursuant to which all of the outstanding TRCP preferred units will be exchanged for shares of our common stock. We will seek to complete the exchange for TRCP preferred units in order to, among other things, significantly simplify our capital structure.
 
Our Organizational Structure
 
Since commencing operations as a farming and water company in 2009, we have built an organizational structure that enabled us to raise capital for specific projects completed by our direct and indirect subsidiaries.
 
In January 2014, the board of directors approved a plan to reorganize our subsidiaries in a more integrated manner based on functional operations. We formed TR Capital Partners, LLC or TR Capital, which issued all of its common units to the Two Rivers. In a series of transactions from January to September 2014, TR Capital entered into Membership Interest Purchase Agreements pursuant to which it issued and sold a total of 30,158,815 preferred units to investors in exchange for consideration comprised of $6.0 million in cash and $18.9 million of outstanding equity and equity-related securities of our subsidiaries other than HCIC Holdings, LLC and Huerfano-Cucharas Irrigation Company.
 

Two Rivers Water & Farming Company | 2018 Financials | Page 6
-----------------------------------+-----------------+-------

 

The TR Capital Partners Limited Liability Company Agreement dated as of January 31, 2014 provides that holders of preferred units generally will be entitled to receive distributions each fiscal year in an amount equal to the lesser of 12% of the preferred unit holders’ aggregate capital contributions and net income, if any, over the 8% base return TR Capital for each fiscal year. Regardless of TR Capital’s operating results, however, preferred unit holders are entitled to a minimum distribution for each full fiscal year equal to 8% of their aggregate capital contributions, payable in equal quarterly installments. If net income for a fiscal year is less than 12% of the preferred unit holders’ aggregate capital contributions, the shortfall will not be payable in any subsequent fiscal year.
 
Pursuant to a binding letter of intent signed with potential outside strategic partners, the accrual of the 2% of TR Capital’s preferred unit holders distribution was suspended effective for the period beginning July 1, 2018.
 
Pursuant to an Exchange Agreement dated as of January 31, 2014 entered into with TR Capital and Two Rivers, any holder may surrender a TR Capital preferred unit to Two Rivers at any time for consideration consisting of (a) accrued but unpaid preferred distributions on the preferred unit through the exchange date, (b) one share of common stock and (c) a warrant to purchase an additional one-half share of common stock at a price of $2.10 per share. TR Capital may require (with limited exceptions) each of its outstanding preferred units to be surrendered to Two Rivers in exchange for such consideration at any time after January 31, 2017, at which (1) for a period of 20 trading days, at least 250,000 shares of common stock have been traded on a national securities exchange for a closing price of at least $3.00 and (b) a registration statement filed by us with the SEC is effective with respect to the shares of common stock, including shares purchasable pursuant to warrants, issuable upon such exchanges. Each warrant issued upon any such exchange generally will be exercisable at any time on or before January 31, 2019, subject to our right to redeem the warrant at any time after January 31, 2017, at which (A) for a period of 20 trading days, at least 250,000 shares of common stock have been traded on a national securities exchange for a closing price of at least $3.00 and (B)  a registration statement has been filed and is effective with respect to the shares of common stock issuable pursuant to such warrant. Under the Exchange Agreement, Two Rivers also granted holders of preferred units one-time demand registration rights under which Two Rivers may be required to file a registration statement covering shares of common stock (including shares subject to warrants) issued or issuable upon exchanges of TR Capital preferred units. As of April 4, 2019, Two Rivers could be required under Two Rivers to issue and deliver to holders of outstanding TR Capital preferred units, upon exchange, up to 26,294,200 shares of common stock together with warrants to purchase up to an additional 14,168,944 shares of common stock. If Two Rivers receives any TR Capital pursuant to exchanges under the Exchange Agreement, it would be entitled to receive distributions on those preferred units pro rata with other holders of preferred units.
 
In February 2019, a stock exchange agreement was signed with potential strategic partners that requires an agreement to be executed between the Company and TR Capital preferred units to exchange all preferred units into the Company’s common shares.
 
Following the completion of those transactions in September 2014, TR Capital and Two Rivers’ other direct and indirect subsidiaries (excluding HCIC Holdings, LLC and HCIC) entered into a series of related transactions as the result of which control and operation of those other subsidiaries and their businesses transferred to TR Capital, which is the operational division of Two Rivers.

Competition
 
Water
 
The rights to use water in Colorado have been fully appropriated to beneficial uses (such as agriculture irrigation and municipal and industrial applications) under court decrees and state regulation according to the prevailing Prior Appropriation Doctrine in which more senior (older) water rights take precedence in times of shortage over junior (newer) water rights. Notwithstanding significant conservation, growth in Colorado with related incremental demands for water has made the rights to divert, convey, store and use water relatively scarce and valuable. There is significant competition for the acquisition and beneficial use of historic water rights. Many competitors for the acquisition of such rights have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do and, consequently, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in assembling, developing and deploying water assets required to support our businesses. Competitors’ resources could overwhelm our efforts and cause adverse consequences to our operational performance. To mitigate such competitive risks, we concentrate our efforts in the Huerfano and Cucharas Rivers watershed where our local knowledge and control of a portfolio of water rights, storage facilities, distribution canals and productive farmland creates a somewhat protected geographic niche. To further mitigate competitive risk, we strive to actively engage with both the farming and municipalities in southeastern Colorado to explore strategies for cooperatively addressing challenges and opportunities faced by those communities—particularly to address the 130,000 acre-foot shortfall in water supplies on the Front Range, without taking valuable farmland out of production.

Regulation
 
Water
 
Background
 
The right to water in Colorado is a right that can be developed, managed, purchased or sold much like real property subject to appropriate regulation. Water rights are judicially decreed and, under Colorado’s application of the Prior Appropriation Doctrine (“first in time, first in right”), senior water right holders are entitled to the beneficial use of water prior to junior holders. Consequently senior water rights are more consistent, reliable and valuable than junior rights, which may be interrupted, or “called out” in the parlance of Colorado water administration.
 
Along the Front Range of Colorado, water is a scarce and valuable resource. Natural precipitation varies widely throughout the year and from one year to another. Rivers, which fill, and sometimes flood, with the spring melt from the mountain snowpack, may be refreshed only with the occasional thunderstorm in the heat of the summer growing season. Annual precipitation also varies between surplus and drought.
 
Additionally, the large majority of Colorado’s population resides on the Front Range (east of the Continental Divide) while the large majority of the state’s precipitation falls on the Western Slope (west of the Divide). Over time, many communities, farms and enterprises developed trans-mountain diversions to bring more water to the Front Range. Precipitation on the Front Range, and water diverted from the Western Slope (meaning west of the Continental Divide), drain to the Mississippi River through the South Platte and Arkansas Rivers. Water on the Western Slope drains through the Colorado River. All of the state’s rivers are administered pursuant to interstate compacts with neighboring states. As a result of the variability of Colorado’s hydrology, its arrangements for diversions, storage and beneficial use, and its obligations to downstream states, Colorado has developed an integrated and complex water rights administration system.
 
In Colorado and the Western United States, the right to use water is based on the Prior Appropriation Doctrine, which is often referred to as “first in time, first in right.” Under this doctrine, water use is allocated to satisfy the oldest (“most senior”) water right before water is allocated to the next water right in historic chronology (a “junior water right” in comparison to a water right perfected earlier). Moreover, in Colorado, water rights and their relative priorities are protected by judicial decrees and are administered by the Office of the State Engineer, or the State Engineer, within the Colorado Department of Water Resources. The ability to consistently irrigate farmland, and thus avoid the inconsistencies of rainfall, is therefore tied to the relative seniority of historic water rights. Two Rivers is focused on developing irrigated farmland and maximizing beneficial use of the water rights associated with that farmland.
 
To manage water uses according to the Prior Appropriation Doctrine, Colorado maintains both judicial oversight through regional water courts and administrative oversight through the Colorado State Engineer. Water rights claims are filed in the water courts, adjudicated as necessary to resolve any adverse claims, and then decreed though an enforceable judgment. The State Engineer is charged with administering the accorded priorities among the various water rights in each of the state’s river systems.
 
Colorado water law further recognizes two distinct but related prior appropriative rights: direct diversion rights and storage rights. Direct diversion rights permit a user in priority to divert water directly from the river for immediate beneficial use (such as irrigation); storage rights permit a user in priority to divert water from the river and impound the water in a reservoir to re-time the water for later beneficial use. Thus, in Colorado, a direct diversion right must be conveyed to an immediate use; it cannot be stored without a storage right. As a result, both types of appropriative rights are often paired, when possible, so that in priority diversion rights can be re-timed through the exercise of a companion storage right to address seasonal and year-to-year variability in natural supplies. The older the appropriation date of any water right, the more reliable is its yield; similarly, the more effectively a senior diversion right is paired with a senior storage right, the more reliable each becomes.
 
Administration of Water Rights
 
In addition to the intra-state administration of water flowing in its rivers, Colorado also has inter-state water administration responsibilities because each of its major rivers (the Colorado, the North Platte and the Arkansas) is governed as well by interstate compacts with downstream states. These compacts are subject to judicial review, interpretation and enforcement under the original jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court to resolve disputes among the states. In 1948, Colorado and Kansas reached an agreement that apportioned the water of the Arkansas River; Colorado was apportioned 60% of the water while Kansas is apportioned 40% of the River’s flow. In order to comply with Colorado’s obligations under the Arkansas River Compact, therefore, water rights on the Arkansas and its tributaries (including the Huerfano and Cucharas Rivers) are administered to assure the compact-required water flows at the Colorado-Kansas state line. When necessary, Colorado’s in-state uses are curtailed, in reverse order of priority, to assure compliance with the compact.

The interstate compacts (beginning with the Colorado River Compact of 1922) increased Colorado’s need to manage its apportioned water to meet the needs of its growing population along the Front Range. Trans-basin diversions (primarily tunnels and canals) were developed, under the Prior Appropriation Doctrine, to divert water from one watershed for conveyance to and use in another. Mainly, water from the Colorado River Basin, west of the Continental Divide, was diverted east to meet the water needs along the earlier developing Front Range by so-called “conservancy districts”. These projects began in the 1930’s and, although many have been in operation for decades, some remain incomplete. Increasingly, further trans-basin diversions are limited not only by competing appropriative water rights in the basins of origin but also by increasingly stringent environmental restrictions.
 
Stymied in their attempts to import additional surface water from distant watersheds, some municipalities and water providers began to rely on inherently unsustainable ground water “mining” (depleting aquifers for current consumption at a rate in excess of the rate at which natural recharge occurs). After decades of such ground water mining, many of the aquifers on the Front Range have been severely depleted. Some municipalities also purchased farms with water diversion rights and then ceased irrigating the farmland, transferring the water to their urban uses. Because neither the practice of ground water mining nor the practice of “buying up and drying up” farmland is sustainable, Colorado law has placed limits and regulations on both practices.
 
Recognizing the need for additional water sources along the Front Range, the Colorado Water Conservation Board published its 2050 Municipal and Industrial Gap Analysis in 2011. This report estimates that the Arkansas and South Platte Basins (essentially the Front Range) will have a combined average annual supply shortage of 130,000 acre-feet of water by 2050. The difficulty and expense of incremental trans-mountain diversions coupled with the unsustainability of ground water mining and agricultural-to-urban transfers—as documented by the Colorado Water Conservation Board—motivates Front Range water purveyors to address the projected gap and to identify and develop inherently scarce renewable sources of water.
 
In order to address a portion of the identified gap between forecast supply and demand within the Arkansas Basin and to provide a substitute source of water for Front Range communities that are too reliant on depleted ground water aquifers, the design and planning for the Southern Delivery System anticipate that other water purveyors will subscribe for pipeline capacity to transport renewable water supplies to their service areas.
 
As early as 2005, the Colorado General Assembly created basin roundtables to convene regional water purveyors to address the looming municipal supply gap. The roundtables were charged to identify “projects and methods to meet the consumptive and non-consumptive needs of the basin.” (Colorado House Bill 05-1177). The potential solutions include Identified Plans and Process or IPPs, Conservation, New Supply Development, and Alternatives to Agricultural Transfers.
 
The Arkansas River Basin Roundtable has only a few IPPs to meet the water supply gap identified in its basin. The most significant of the Arkansas Basin IPPs is the Southern Delivery System, a two-stage development project budgeted at $1.45 billion primarily funded by four regional water purveyors including Colorado Springs. Phase One of the 62-mile water supply pipeline began operations in 2016. The Southern Delivery System connects the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation’s Pueblo Reservoir on the Arkansas River, the point of delivery under the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation contracts, with the purveyors’ service areas.
