Impact of COVID-19 pandemic

 We continue to actively address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact globally. Due to economic uncertainty connected to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced lengthened sales cycles and reduced demand for some of our security solutions. ​

1



 In the current and future periods, we may experience weaker customer demand, requests for discounts or extended payment terms, customer bankruptcies, supply chain disruption, employee staffing constraints and difficulties, government restrictions or other factors that could negatively impact the Company and its business, operations and financial results.​
As we cannot predict the duration or scope of the pandemic or its impact on the economy, financial markets and our customers, any negative impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated, but it could be material. We continue to closely monitor the Company’s financial health and liquidity and the impact of the pandemic on the Company. We are able to serve the needs of our customers while taking steps to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners, and communities. See Part I – Item 1A – Risk Factors of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the potential impact of COVID-19 on the Company.
Industry Background
Rapid global growth in cloud and mobile banking transactions is driving increased demand for multi-channel security solutions and enhanced user experiences across the financial services industry. Similarly, increasing remote corporate access of important resources by employees, business partners and customers is introducing new security risks for participants. Large and powerful criminal hacking organizations are launching more sophisticated hacking attacks with greater frequency. The criminal activities of private and state-sponsored hacking organizations have driven an increased need for security solutions and expansion of regulations requiring improved security measures to protect against hacking attacks and breaches. Several governments worldwide have issued specific recommendations either requiring or advocating multi-factor authentication and other security measures to improve the security of remote banking transactions. We believe these global trends have been accelerated by the pandemic and will continue and that the market for authentication, anti-fraud, and e-signature solutions will continue to grow driven by growth in digital banking transactions, digital commerce, work-from-home corporate access requirements, growing awareness of the impact of cyber-crime, and new government regulations.
Our Background
Our predecessor company, VASCO Corp., entered the data security business in 1991 through the acquisition of a controlling interest in ThumbScan, Inc., which we renamed as VASCO Data Security, Inc.
In 1996, we expanded our computer security business by acquiring Lintel Security NV/SA, a Belgian corporation, which included assets associated with the development of security tokens and security technologies for personal computers and computer networks. Also in 1996, we acquired Digipass NV/SA, a Belgian corporation, which was also a developer of security tokens and security technologies. In 1997, the acquired entity was renamed VASCO Data Security NV/SA.
In 1997, VASCO Data Security International, Inc. was incorporated and in 1998, we completed a registered exchange offer with the holders of the outstanding securities of VASCO Corp., becoming a publicly traded company.
In 2006, we opened our international headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland.
In 2013, we acquired Cronto Limited (“Cronto”), a provider of secure visual transaction authentication solutions for online banking. 
In 2014, we acquired Risk IDS, a provider of risk analysis solutions to the banking community. 
In 2015, we acquired Silanis Technology Inc., a leading provider of electronic signature (e-signature) and digital transaction solutions used to electronically sign, send, and manage documents. The solution is sold under the OneSpan Sign (formerly eSignLive) name and is trusted by many of the largest banks, insurers, and government agencies.

In May 2018, we acquired Dealflo Limited, a leading provider of identity verification and end-to-end financial automation solutions. 
Also in May 2018, VASCO Data Security international, Inc. changed its name to OneSpan Inc. The Company’s name change reflects a shift in our strategy and solution offerings.
Including our predecessor companies, we have engaged in sixteen acquisitions and two dispositions.
Our Products and Services Portfolio
Digital Agreements
OneSpan Sign supports a broad range of e-signature requirements from simple to complex, and from the occasional agreement to processing tens of thousands of transactions. OneSpan Sign provides multiple deployment options including public cloud, private cloud, or on-premises without compromising security or functionality. The solution is also available in a Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) SaaS-level compliant cloud, allowing U.S. government agencies to implement e-signatures in the cloud and meet GSA security requirements.
Customers can configure OneSpan Sign to reinforce their brand for a seamless signing experience. Each step of the digital agreement workflow can be customized, from authentication to e-signing and secure storage. OneSpan Sign also provides comprehensive and secure electronic evidence for strong legal protection by capturing all actions that took place during the agreement process. This reduces the time and cost of gathering evidence and demonstrating legal and regulatory compliance. Electronic signature capabilities can be a critical component of the account opening and onboarding processes, providing a secure and user-friendly way to execute legally binding agreements.
The OneSpan Sign Virtual Room option adds videoconferencing and collaboration capabilities to OneSpan Sign to support human-mediated agreement processes. This helps businesses deliver secure, interactive experiences for complex agreements that require human assistance. 
Digital Identity & Authentication
OneSpan Cloud Authentication is a quick-to-deploy, cloud-based multifactor authentication solution that supports a full range of authentication options including biometrics, push notification, visual cryptograms for transaction data signing, SMS and hardware authenticators. It eliminates cost associated with managing legacy on-premises authentication technology and provides a seamless upgrade path to more comprehensive capabilities such as Intelligent Adaptive Authentication, which applies a precise level of security for each unique customer interaction using advanced real-time risk analysis and scoring. 
Mobile Security Suite is a comprehensive software development kit that allows application developers to natively integrate security features including geolocation, device identification, jailbreak and root detection, fingerprint and face recognition, one-time password delivery via push notification, and electronic signing, among others. Through a comprehensive library of APIs, application developers can extend and strengthen application security, deliver enhanced convenience to their application users, and streamline application deployment and lifecycle management processes. Mobile Security Suite also includes a Runtime Application Self-Protection module, which can detect and mitigate malicious app activity and potential loss to hacking activities. 
Mobile Authenticator Studio is a user-friendly and secure mobile authenticator that operates as a discrete mobile application. It includes many of the features of the Mobile Security Suite and can easily be tailored to meet the needs of numerous authentication processes. It can be customized and deployed rapidly without extensive technical support ensuring strong security with compelling value.
Mobile App Shielding protects a mobile banking app from the inside out. It allows the app to securely operate even in potentially hostile environments, such as jailbroken or rooted devices – and only deny service when necessary.​

OneSpan Identity Verification gives banks and other financial institutions access to a wide range of identity verification services – all through a single API integration. This includes identity document (e.g., driver’s license, passport, etc.) capture and real-time authenticity verification, as well as facial comparison (“selfie”) and liveness detection to establish that the individual presenting the identity document is the same person whose picture appears on the authenticated identity document. 
Authentication Server resides on-premises and incorporates a range of strong authentication utilities and solutions designed to allow organizations to securely authenticate users and transactions. The solution, once integrated, becomes largely transparent to users, minimizing rollout and support issues. Authentication Server encompasses multiple authentication technologies (e.g., passwords, dynamic password technologies, certificates, and biometrics) and allows the use of any combination of those technologies simultaneously.
We also offer a wide variety of hardware authenticators, each of which has its own distinct characteristics to meet the needs of our customers. All models of the Digipass family of authenticators are designed to work together so customers can switch devices without changes to their existing infrastructure. Our models range from one-button devices and smart card readers to devices that include more advanced technologies, such as public key infrastructure (“PKI”) and visual cryptography. 
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights and Licenses
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, design, and trade secret laws, as well as employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights. In particular, we hold several patents in the U.S. and in other countries, which cover multiple aspects of our technology. These patents expire between now and more than 10 years from now. In addition to the issued patents, we also have several patent applications pending in the U.S., Europe, and other countries. The majority of our issued and pending patents cover our Digipass product line. We believe these patents to be valuable property rights and we rely on the strength of our patents and on trade secret law to protect our proprietary technology. We furthermore have registrations for most of our trademarks in most of the markets where we sell the corresponding products and services and registrations of the designs of many of our hardware products primarily in the EU and China. To the extent that we believe our intellectual property rights are being infringed upon, we intend to assert vigorously our intellectual property rights, including but not limited to, pursuing all available legal remedies.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts historically have been, and will continue to be, concentrated on solution enhancement, new technology development, and related new software introductions. We employ a team of full-time engineers and, from time to time, also engage independent engineering firms to conduct non-strategic product development efforts on our behalf. For fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we incurred expenses of $47.4 million, $41.2 million, and $42.5 million, respectively, for research and development.
Production
Our Digipass security hardware products are manufactured by third party manufacturers pursuant to purchase orders that we issue. Our hardware Digipass products are made primarily from commercially available electronic components purchased globally. Our software solutions are produced in-house or developed by third parties and sold under license.
Hardware Digipass products utilize commercially available programmable microprocessors purchased from several suppliers. The microprocessors are the most important components of our security authenticators that are not commodity items readily available on the open market. Some microprocessors are single sourced. Orders of microprocessors generally require a lead-time of 12-16 weeks. We attempt to maintain a sufficient inventory of all parts to handle short-term increases in orders.

Large orders that would significantly deplete our inventory are typically required to be placed with more than twelve weeks of lead-time, allowing us to make appropriate arrangements with our suppliers. We purchase microprocessors and arrange for shipment to third parties for assembly and testing in accordance with our design specifications. The majority of our Digipass products are manufactured by four independent factories in Southern China and one in Romania. Purchases are made on a volume purchase order basis. We supply product test equipment at the point of assembly. We maintain local teams in China and Romania to conduct quality control and quality assurance procedures. Periodic visits are conducted by our personnel for quality management, assembly process review, and supplier relations.
The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a temporary closure of some component suppliers and third party manufacturers, and a reduction in global marine and to some degree air transportation capacity. Adjustments to our supply chain, manufacturing and transportation workflow processes have enabled us to meet customer delivery requirements.
Competition
The market for digital solutions for identity, security, and business productivity solutions is very competitive and, like most technology-driven markets, is subject to rapid change and constantly evolving solutions and services. Our anti-fraud products are designed to allow authorized users access to a computing environment or application, in some cases using patented technology, as a replacement for or supplement to a static password. Although certain of our security technologies are patented, there are other organizations that offer anti-fraud solutions that compete with us for market share. Our main competitors in our anti-fraud markets are Gemalto, a subsidiary of Thales Group, and RSA Security. There are many other companies, such as Transmit Security, Yubico, Symantec, Forgerock and Early Warning that offer competing services. In addition to these companies, we face competition from many small authentication solution providers, many of whom offer new technologies and niche solutions such as biometric or behavioral analysis. We believe that competition in this market is likely to intensify as a result of increasing demand for security products. Our primary competitors for electronic signature solutions include DocuSign and Adobe Systems. Both companies are significantly larger than us. In addition to these companies, there are dozens of smaller and regional providers of electronic signing solutions.
We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for digital solutions for identity, security, and business productivity, as well as electronic signatures include the strength and effectiveness of the solution, technical features, ease of use, quality and reliability, customer service and support, brand recognition, customer base, distribution channels, and the total cost of ownership of the solution. Although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to such factors, there can be no assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors.
Some of our present and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, purchasing, and other resources. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products, or to deliver competitive products at a lower end-user price. Current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers. It is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. Accordingly, we have forged, and will continue to forge, our own partnerships to offer a broader range of products and capabilities to the market.
Sales and Marketing
Our solutions are sold worldwide through our direct sales force as well as through distributors, resellers, systems integrators, and original equipment manufacturers. Our sales staff coordinates sales activity through both our sales channels and those of our partners making direct sales calls either alone or with the sales personnel of our partners. Our sales staff also provides product education seminars to sales and technical personnel of resellers and distributors with whom we have working relationships and to potential end-users of our products.

We offer customers a choice between SaaS, private cloud, and traditional on-premise software deployments.
Part of our expanded selling effort includes finding additional applications for our products. In addition, our marketing plan calls for the identification of new business opportunities that may require enhanced security or areas where we do not currently market our products. 
Customers and Markets
We generally focus our sales and marketing efforts in three primary areas. The first is financial institutions where the majority of our revenue is derived. This segment includes traditional banks, credit unions, and online-only banks. We also sell to the enterprise market segment and the government, healthcare and insurance market segments in select regions around the globe. We believe there are substantial opportunities for future growth in the market segments we serve as we expand our product portfolio of digital agreement and digital identity and authentication solutions.
Our top 10 customers contributed 22%, 21%, and 29%, in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, of total worldwide revenue. 
A significant portion of our sales is denominated in foreign currencies and changes in exchange rates impact results of operations. To mitigate exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, we attempt to denominate an amount of billings in a currency such that it would provide a hedge against operating expenses being incurred in that currency. For additional information regarding how currency fluctuations can affect our business, please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”
We also experience seasonality or variation across the year in our markets. These trends can include lower sales during the summer months, particularly in EMEA.
Financial Information Relating to Foreign and Domestic Operations
For financial information regarding OneSpan, see our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have a single operating segment for all our products and operations. See Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a breakdown of revenue, gross profit and long-lived assets between the U.S. and other regions.
Government Regulation
As a global cybersecurity company, we are subject to complex and evolving global regulations in the various jurisdictions in which our products and services are used. The most significant government regulations that impact our business are discussed below. For further discussion of how global regulations may impact our business, see Item 1A – Risk Factors.
We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and other laws that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage.
In addition, we are subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the U.S. Therefore, we do not permit financial institutions or entities that are domiciled in countries or territories subject to comprehensive OFAC trade sanctions (currently, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria and Crimea), or that are included on OFAC’s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked persons, to purchase OneSpan products and services or engage in transactions using our services.
The European General Data Production Regulation (GDPR) took effect in May 2019 and applies to certain of our products and services used by customers in Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that 

6



receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different from those previously in place in the European Union, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Other jurisdictions, such as Canada and Australia have enacted data privacy or data protection laws. As these laws continue to emerge in the countries where we or our customers operate, we need to analyze each of them to determine the applicability to our corporate operations and the applicability to our solutions and customers.
We are subject to the Restriction on the Use of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC (also known as the “RoHS Directive”) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (also known as the “WEEE Directive”). These directives restrict the distribution of products containing certain substances, including lead, within applicable geographies and require a manufacturer or importer to recycle products containing those substances. These directives affect the worldwide electronics and electronics components industries as a whole.
Because banking and financial services is our largest industry target market, the government regulations affecting our customers in this area have a significant indirect effect on our business. For example, regulatory changes in Europe to promote a more open and connected digital banking ecosystem create compliance needs for our customers as well as market opportunities for those market participants that move to capitalize on these changes. Similar regulatory dynamics occur in the other primary markets where we have customers, such as healthcare and government. Additional proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business.
Human Capital
OneSpan’s values focus on developing and maintaining a world class innovative workforce through collaboration, accountability, transparency, and speed. Our talented teams are carefully managed to ensure retention and ability to sustain business performance with an eye toward the future. 
Our talent management and succession plan process at OneSpan includes the identification of key positions based on current and future business strategies, the identification of potential successors, and a plan for talent development. In addition to deep technical and skill development opportunities that enable OneSpan to foster employee engagement, we conduct extensive compliance-related training which is completed by all employees annually. Our managers of people are offered a variety of leadership development modules. Moreover, all employees are empowered to lead from any seat. 
 OneSpan strives to offer competitive base and variable pay programs. We use market benchmarks to ensure external competitiveness while maintaining internal value or equity within the organization. Our short-term and long-term incentive plans are designed to provide a variable pay opportunity to reward the attainment of key financial and operational goals and shareholder value creation. The mix among base compensation, short-term incentives and long-term incentives is designed to align with the competitive market.
​
 OneSpan is committed to fostering, cultivating, and preserving a culture of diversity, equality and inclusion. Our vision is to embrace an inclusive and engaged culture that drives a sense of belonging and respects and celebrates our differences. In addition, we have an evolving program and sets of policies and procedures regarding corporate social responsibility, privacy, compliance and security. We believe these issues are important not only to our customers and investors, but also to our employees. Certain highlights on these matters are presented publicly on our website onespan.com under the About Us section.
​
As of December 31, 2021, we had 879 total employees, including 463 located in the Americas, 381 located in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa), and 35 located in Asia Pacific. Of the total employees, 367 were involved in sales, marketing, operations, and customer support, 373 in research and development and 139 in general and administration.
