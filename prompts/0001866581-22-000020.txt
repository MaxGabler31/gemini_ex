ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Dutch Bros Inc. is a Delaware corporation, formed on June 4, 2021 for the purpose of facilitating our IPO in September 2021 in order to carry on the Company’s business. Dutch Bros Inc. Class A common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “BROS”. 
OUR COMPANY
Dutch Bros is a high growth operator and franchisor of drive-thru shops that focus on serving high QUALITY, hand-crafted beverages with unparalleled SPEED and superior SERVICE. Founded in 1992 by brothers Dane and Travis Boersma, Dutch Bros began with a double-head espresso machine and a pushcart in Grants Pass, Oregon. Today, we believe that Dutch Bros is one of the fastest-growing brands in the foodservice and restaurant industry in the United States by location count. In the past 6 years, we have increased our shop count from 254 shops in seven states at the end of 2015 to 538 shops in 12 states as of December 31, 2021, of which 271 were company-operated shops and 267 franchise shops. Our shops are located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Washington.
While our espresso-based beverages are still at the core of what we do, Dutch Bros now offers a wide variety of unique, customizable cold and hot beverages that strive to delight a broad array of customers. Dutch Bros is more than just the products we serve—we are dedicated to making differences in the lives of our employees, customers and communities. The combination of hand-crafted and high-quality beverages, our unique drive-thru experience and our community-driven, people-first culture has allowed us to successfully open new shops and continue to share the “Dutch Luv.”
In 2021, our company-operated shops generated gross margin of 21.1% and contribution margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, of 25.1%1. These highly attractive financial returns generated by our existing and new shops, coupled with our desire to develop our people and culture, have led us to focus primarily on company-operated shops as we accelerate our new shop development, all while our current franchise partners continue to open new shops in their existing markets.

The Dutch Bros Experience
Dutch Bros is entirely focused on delivering on its core values of QUALITY, SPEED and SERVICE in every interaction we have. Every visit to Dutch Bros should feel like a celebration. Broistas are genuinely excited to serve our customers and interested in how they can make their day better. Runners greet our customers before they get to the drive-thru window to personalize every order and, when needed, explain our menu. They use tablets to take orders, allowing broistas to sequence the crafting of beverages and manage car throughput in the drive-thru lane, ensuring that QUALITY, SPEED and SERVICE remain consistent throughout the day. This Dutch Bros experience has built our strong base of recurring, loyal customers and contributed to our sustained growth.
Our Broistas
Our people are the key to our success, and broistas are the face of Dutch Bros. We embrace a customer-first attitude and use every interaction during the drive-thru experience to connect with our customers. To achieve this experience, we and our franchise partners are committed to attracting and retaining broistas who are passionate about delivering an experience that exceeds our customers’ expectations each and every day. Our broistas are trained and provided with support to enable them to remember our regular customers by name, recall their usual order, have treats ready for four-legged members of the family and know when to offer a complimentary drink to someone having a tough day. Broistas serve our beverages to our customers with a smile, an encouraging word, or a high-five.
Our Menu
Our hand-crafted beverage-focused lineup features hot and cold espresso-based beverages, cold brew coffee products, our proprietary Dutch Bros. Blue Rebel energy drinks, tea, lemonade, smoothies and other beverages curated from the Dutch Bros “secret” menu where customers can customize their beverages, such as adding “soft-top,” a sweet, creamy whipped topping, to almost any order. Our Private Reserve coffee is a 100% Arabica three bean blend sourced through our in-house coffee roasting facility and extracted using the finest La Marzocco machines to deliver shots of smooth, full-bodied espresso. The variety, innovation and customization of our menu drives broad demographic appeal and balance throughout the day and across all geographies.

Our Shops
Our business model is built around highly efficient drive-thru shops, which place a premium on customer convenience without sacrificing the personal experience. Our new shops are typically 865 to 950 square feet, and we target lots that are at least 25,000 square feet to handle substantial car volume throughout the day. All our shops deploy either a single or double drive-thru window with multiple feeder lanes for traffic flow. Most of our shops also have walk-up ordering windows, party patios and escape lanes to prevent unnecessary congestion. In 2021, our company-operated shops generated AUVs of approximately $1.8 million with strong shop-level gross margin of 21.1% and contribution margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, of 25.1%1.
Our Growth
Our Long-Term Franchise Partners
Historically, Dutch Bros used a franchising strategy alongside company-operated shop development to drive growth in select markets. Over time, as we decided to grow more from within, we only offered franchise partnership opportunities to the highest-quality employees within our network. In 2008, we stopped selling franchises to people that did not come from within our system. In 2017, we decided to stop franchising altogether and moved to a company-operated strategy with all operators recruited from within our system. While we maintain great relationships with our existing franchise partners and they continue to open new shops as they look to infill their high-demand markets, the majority of our growth is expected to continue to come from company-operated shops. 
A People-First Culture
We believe that our success is correlated with employee engagement, which is dependent on hiring, retaining, developing, and motivating employees. We plan all our new shop growth around existing, high-performing Dutch Bros broistas ready to assume leadership roles and eventually become shop managers and then operators. We believe this ensures a consistent experience and extends our culture in all our shops and markets. In 2021, we successfully entered Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas by promoting leaders from within.
Simplify Operations and Grow the Business
Over the last several years, we executed critical, infrastructure-building corporate investments to position us for future growth, including: our loyalty app, ERP and HRIS tools, an enterprise-based point of sale tool for all shops in the system, expansion of capacity in our Grants Pass, Oregon roasting facility and the addition of industry experts to our leadership team. We made these foundational investments in our organizational infrastructure and employees to support future new shop growth.

OUR GROWTH STRATEGIES TO SHARE THE “DUTCH LUV”
Dutch Bros is in the early stages of its growth story. We will expand our business to positively impact our communities through the following growth strategies:

Continue to Attract and Develop Great People, Who are our Growth Capital

•Robust internal training and career advancement programs, which provide a high-quality talent pool of candidates striving for larger roles within our company.
•New hires in all shops participate in a 12-day training program and shadow our experienced broistas before qualification as a broista. In addition, broistas in new shops receive training from experienced traveling leaders before permanently taking over the shop.
•Our people systems are designed to maintain the Dutch Bros culture as we scale, enabling us to continue making a positive impact in new communities and providing career development opportunities for employees.

Open New Shops Wherever People Want Great Beverages

•Long-term potential for at least 4,000 Dutch Bros locations in the United States.1 We have a strong new shop pipeline of sites identified, which exceeds our planned company-operated shops to be opened in 2022 and 2023. 
•Build scale within our existing footprint by proactively opening new shops in our existing markets to reach new customers and alleviate capacity constraints at nearby shops to provide the best customer experience.
•Enter and scale new markets with comprehensive market and development plans for not only the initial new shop, but also future shops in the new market.

Increase Brand Awareness and Encourage Deeper Customer Engagement

•One of the strongest drivers of Dutch Bros brand awareness is word-of-mouth advocacy from our customers. Our commitment to our people encourages them to become enthusiastic brand ambassadors, and we believe that their visible love for the brand is infectious.
•Our digital presence enables us to serve customers unique beverage-focused content, information related to our social impact initiatives and new ways to engage with Dutch Bros. As a people-focused company, we believe our Dutch Rewards program provides an opportunity to connect with customers, learn more about them and enhance our relationships with them.
•We intend to enhance our digital and social media footprint to allow our passionate customers and crews to engage with Dutch Bros across multiple channels by sharing experiences with friends and family. To further support our customer engagement, we plan to continue building deep connections within the communities we serve.

Invest in and Use Digital Technology to Improve the Customer Experience

•At our core, we are in the people business and believe the purpose of technology should be to remove friction in our customer interactions, thereby providing opportunities to create deeper connections and a better service experience.
•Improve speed and efficiency by investing and integrating technology to continue delivering the best Dutch Bros experience to our growing number of customers. 
•Menu innovation based on customer insights utilizing customer data to refine our menu and “secret” menu offerings to further drive new business, increase guest spends, and encourage more frequent visits from new and legacy customers. 

Expand Margins Through Operating Leverage

•Procurement system set up for adaptability and scalability allows for flexibility of our input costs. 
•Flexibility to increase production of our coffee and beverages through our Grants Pass, Oregon facilities and strong relationships with several co-manufacturers, along with plans for an additional roasting facility allow for us to support our expansion strategy and long-term supply chain requirements.
•We expect the relative rate of our corporate costs to allow our operating margins to be enhanced going forward, as we anticipate our selling, general and administrative costs to grow at a slower rate than our shop base and revenue. 
Operations
Sourcing and Supply Chain
We roast our own proprietary blend of 100% Arabica coffee. We partner with third-party importers and exporters to purchase and import our green coffee beans. Through this relationship, we source high-quality coffee beans from across Central and South America. We typically purchase coffee contracts 18-24 months in advance of when we take physical delivery of the beans, allowing us to lock in pricing and to manage our input costs. This practice also allows us to be a good partner to our coffee producers, providing security of future business.
We currently roast all of our coffee in our roasting facility in Grants Pass, Oregon. We roast our coffee bean varietals to specific profiles designed to highlight each of the coffee bean’s unique flavors and aromas. After the coffee beans are roasted, we blend them to create our signature Private Reserve espresso. We package and ship our Private Reserve, Decaf and White Coffee espresso blends to six distribution centers that supply all our company-operated and franchised locations.
We have taken several steps to increase our diversity of supply and reduce transportation costs as we expand company-operated shops eastward within the United States. We are finalizing the economics of our plan to build a second roasting facility in the Midwest United States. We anticipate the new roasting facility will be operational in 2023, and will cost approximately $15 million - $20 million. 
We designed our supply chain to be flexible in order to respond efficiently to changes in the market. On average, we typically have approximately four months of green coffee bean inventory stored at our two ports of entry in the United States or at our roasting plant in Grants Pass, Oregon. In the event of a supply disruption in any one of our production origins, we have identified alternate coffee beans with substantially similar flavor profiles that can be sourced and incorporated to produce our blend.
We also manufacture our own proprietary Dutch Bros. Blue Rebel Energy Drink via a co-bottling and co-packaging relationships.

Quality and Safety
We and our franchise partners maintain a safe, healthy environment at each shop through the careful training and supervision of personnel and by following rigorous quality standards. Our Quality Assurance team informs, monitors, and reports on standards for preparation and cleaning, as well as inspects every shop in the system on a quarterly basis. 
Our commitment to beverage and food safety is strengthened through the direct relationship between our supply chain, culinary, and quality assurance teams. We review all our supply partners’ decisions regarding ingredients, and we reserve the right to conduct spot-checks. We examine each suppliers’ safety and quality records and verify insurance coverage. We believe that our established requirement for franchise partners to purchase certain supplies and equipment from approved vendors further enhances safety and quality within our system.
Shop and Corporate Systems
Our franchise and company-operated shops use a computerized point of sale and back-office system, which we believe will support our growth plans and enhance our customer experience. This point-of-sale system is designed to increase order quality and consistency and make it easier for the broista to interact with the customer. This integrated system allows us to manage labor, product mix, throughput, ticket, among others, in real time. We also have made additional investments in our corporate and enterprise wide systems, which we believe prepare us for future growth. 
People
Our people are the driving force of our mission and are a fundamental driver of our success. One of the most important relationships we have is with our employees, who are key members of the communities we love and support. We attract and seek out potential broistas by identifying people with a love for life, a natural ability to connect with folks from all walks of life, and most of all, a big smile!
As of December 31, 2021, we and our franchise partners have approximately 19,000 employees, of which 11,000 employees are in our company-operated shops. Of our company-operated shop employees, approximately 71% are female, 27% are male, and 2% gender is not disclosed. The chart below provides the approximate percentage of systemwide employees by shop type and by state location.

* As of December 31, 2021, we had employees in Tennessee as part of pre-opening activities for our shops that opened in the first quarter of 2022, which are not included in our locations as part of “Properties” section in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-K.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
As a company, we are striving to be a leader in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). Our leadership and policies stand united in our support of employees, customers and communities in the fullness of their identities. We are actively working to develop a holistic DEI program that can be a resource for everyone we serve. The events of the past several years, have offered another reminder of how critically important our efforts have become, and as a result we have taken real, meaningful steps toward advancement of our DEI program including, but not limited, to the following:
•hiring an industry expert to serve as our Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and developing long term programs;
•offering DEI training to headquarters and field leadership;
•launching employee resource groups at our headquarters for leaders of color and for women leaders; and
•reviewing our policies to make sure they are promoting equity, as well as supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace for everyone.
Health and Safety
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we took quick and decisive action to protect the health and safety of our employees and began following CDC, state, and local health guidelines. As a result, we began requiring employees to wear masks, instituting and enforcing mandatory employee handwashing at set intervals, conducting temperature checks and daily health screenings, and enhancing cleaning protocols. We also quickly pivoted to a cashless and frictionless payment system, eliminated mug refills, transitioned to wrapped straws, and eliminated our paper stamp card loyalty program. In March 2021, based on updated guidance, we returned to accepting cash. In lieu of returning to our paper stamp card loyalty program, we transitioned to our new Dutch Rewards app-based rewards program. 
We adjusted staffing models to accommodate social distancing, reduced in-person meetings, transitioned to virtual meetings and took steps to encourage any sick employees to stay home by offering paid catastrophic leave and loosened guidelines for use of sick leave. Additionally, we instituted a temporary “Thank You” pay bonus to our frontline shop workers of $3.00 per hour throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in recognition of our employees’ hard work, sacrifices, and commitment during the pandemic. We phased out the “Thank You” pay bonus in the second quarter of 2021.
Total Rewards
We offer competitive salaries and wages with continual assessment by location of the business environment and labor market. We are continually making enhancements to our total rewards program to attract and retain top talent as part of our expanding growth strategy. We offer a comprehensive suite of benefits to our broistas, shop management, and headquarters support employees, such as:
•company paid medical, dental, vision, and life insurance for all full-time employees
•company paid parental leave of more than eight weeks, after 6 months of employment for shop management and headquarters support employees;
•wellness program to help employees live their best lives;
•access to free drinks and Dutch Bros swag for employees to show off their “Dutch Luv”;
•tuition assistance toward employees’ professional development after one full year of employment; 
•up to 16 hours of paid volunteer hours to use when helping out the community, which is available to all employees; and

•team focused culture with growth and leadership opportunities for career advancement
Training and Development
We commit resources to train and develop our broistas. Our standard training consists of two phases—two days of cultural immersion, history and fundamental knowledge, followed by 10 shifts of on-the-job training. All new broistas read and review our employee handbook and our Manifesto to ensure they have a baseline understanding of our policies, procedures, operations, and an appreciation for our unique culture. After on-the-job training and successfully passing a mandatory quality check on operations, history, and culture with 100% proficiency the new hire is officially qualified to work a shift as a broista. Generally, new broistas must demonstrate proficiency in beverage builds within three weeks of hire.
Our people are the driving force of our mission, and we are committed to inspiring and facilitating their personal and professional growth as they fulfill their dreams and contribute to their communities. We have created our own program to develop and track broistas’ performance as they progress towards their goals. This program is designed to help our people maximize their personal potential, either inside or outside our organization. Our shop managers conduct regular check-ins to help broistas understand where they are on their personal path and within their career at Dutch Bros. Our leadership development model clarifies and outlines growth opportunities at all levels of the organization and furthers our philosophy of hiring and developing leaders from within.
Our development focus allows us to create and maintain a robust pipeline of talent to support our growth. We pride ourselves on our ability to train, retain, and promote across all levels of our organization, and it is our policy to have a homegrown operator base, whether from our company-operated or franchise shops. We believe this arrangement is a unique “win-win-win” situation, where Dutch Bros has access to a larger pool of high-quality qualified potential operators. Because of our decision to have a homegrown operator base, our new shop growth is predicated on developing a healthy pipeline of home-grown talent. We believe we have a sufficient pipeline to sustain our new shop growth for the next several years. As we continue to add additional shops, we expect our people pipeline to continue to grow and provide additional runway for development into the foreseeable future.

Planet
Part of giving back to our communities is supporting the environment. We are focused on and are preparing to commit to a series of initiatives to ensure our products, processes, and shops are in line with, and are moving toward, environmental best practices, such as reducing our shop water use, diverting waste from landfills, responsibly sourcing our coffees, and procuring renewable energy to offset our energy usage. 
Philanthropy
Since our inception, we have been dedicated to giving back to the communities in which we serve, and we consider our brand to be a powerful platform for social impact. Today, we host three company-wide givebacks days each year.
•“Dutch Luv” — every February, we donate $1 from every drink sold to local organizations working to fight food insecurity in our communities.
•“Drink One for Dane” — every May, in honor of our co-founder Dane Boersma, we raise funds for the Muscular Dystrophy Association to find a cause and cure for ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), or Lou Gehrig’s disease.
•“Buck for Kids” — every September, we dedicate a day to give $1 from every drink sold to nonprofit organizations helping create brighter futures for local kids.
Additionally, our operators and franchise partners are empowered to create their own local, shop-specific giveback programs to build relationships within their communities. Dutch Bros Foundation also contributes annually to causes we care about to ensure love abounds, and donated approximately $3.3 million in 2021 across multiple causes. A culture of philanthropy and giving back to build better communities permeates the entire Dutch Bros organization, energizing both our broistas and customers alike.
Competition
The beverage industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and our shops compete on a variety of factors, including convenience, taste, price, quality, service, and location. We believe our primary competitors include drive-thru coffee shops, specialty coffee shops and drive-thru quick service restaurants. Our competitors range from multi-unit national and regional chains to single-location local shops. Our competitors operate both company-operated, franchised and mixed business models. Because of our proprietary Dutch Bros. Blue Rebel energy beverages, we also compete with companies outside of the beverage industry, such as convenience food shops.
Intellectual Property
We own many registered trademarks and service marks in the United States, the most important of which might be our trademarked Windmill logo which we anticipate achieving the iconic status of other recognized brands in the quick service restaurant market segment. Other important trademarks include our “Dutch Bros.,” “Dutch Bros. Coffee,” and “Dutch Bros. Blue Rebel” word marks and our recognizable Dutch Bros sign logo. We believe the Dutch Bros. name and the many distinctive marks associated with it are of significant value and are very important to our business. Accordingly, as a general policy, we pursue registration and monitor the use of our marks in the United States and challenge any unauthorized use.

We license the use of our marks to franchise partners, third-party vendors and others through franchise agreements, vendor agreements and licensing agreements. These agreements typically restrict third parties’ activities with respect to use of the marks and impose brand standards requirements. We require licensees to inform us of any potential infringement of the marks.
We register some of our copyrighted material and otherwise rely on common law protection of our copyrighted works. Such copyrighted materials are not material to our business.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, as well as other statutory and regulatory requirements, including those related to, among others, nutritional content labeling and disclosure requirements, food safety regulations, local licensure, building and zoning regulations, employment regulations and laws and regulations related to our licensed operations. New laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may also impact our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high, are likely to increase in the future, and any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. See "Regulatory and Legal Risks" in Item 1A, Risk Factors for more information.
We are not aware of any federal, state or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, that have materially affected, or are reasonably expected to materially affect, our results of operations, competitive position, or capital expenditures.
