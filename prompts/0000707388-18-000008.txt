ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Digirad delivers convenient, effective, and efficient healthcare solutions on an as needed, when needed, and where needed basis. Our diverse portfolio of mobile healthcare solutions and diagnostic imaging equipment and services, provides hospitals, physician practices, and imaging centers throughout the United States access to technology and services necessary to provide exceptional patient care in the rapidly changing healthcare environment. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that our competitive strengths are our streamlined and cost-efficient approach to providing healthcare solutions to our customers at the point of need as well as providing an array of industry-leading, technologically relevant healthcare imaging and monitoring services:
Imaging Services and Products

• | Broad Portfolio of Imaging Services. Approximately 78% of our revenues are derived from provision of diagnostic imaging services to our customers. Based on this, we have developed and continue to refine an industry leading, customer service focused approach to all our customers. We have found our focus in this area is a key factor in acquiring and keeping our service-based customers. 


• | Unique Dual Sales and Service Offering. For the majority of our businesses, we offer a service-based model to our customers, allowing them to avoid making costly capital and logistical investments required to offer these services internally. Further, for a portion of our business, we have the ability to sell the underlying capital equipment directly to our customers should their needs change and they desire to provide services on their own with the underlying capital equipment. This ability to serve our customers in a variety of capacities from selling equipment directly, or providing more flexibility through a service-based model, allows us to serve our customers according to their exact needs, as well as the ability to capture both ends of the revenue spectrum.


• | Utilization of Highly Trained Staff. We recruit and maintain highly trained staff for our clinical and repair services, which in turn allows us to provide superior and more efficient services.


• | Leading Solid-State Technology. Our solid-state gamma cameras utilize proprietary photo-detector modules that enable us to build smaller and lighter cameras that are portable, with a degree of ruggedness that can withstand the vibration associated with transportation. Our dedicated cardiac imagers require a floor space of as little as seven feet by eight feet, can generally can be installed without facility renovations, and use standard power. Our portable cameras are ideal for mobile operators or practices desiring to service multiple office locations or imaging facilities.

Strategy
We seek to grow our business by, among other things:

1. | Organic growth from our core businesses. We believe that we operate in markets and geographies that will allow us to continue to grow our core businesses, allowing us to benefit from our scale and strengths. We plan to focus our efforts on markets in which we already have a presence in order to take advantage of personnel, infrastructure, and brand recognition we have in these areas. 


2. | Introduction of new services. We plan to continue to focus on healthcare solutions related businesses that deliver necessary assets, services and logistics directly to the customer site. We believe that over time we can either purchase or develop new and complementary businesses and take advantage of our customer loyalty and distribution channels. 


3. | Acquisition of similar or complementary businesses. We plan to continue to look at similar or complementary businesses that meet our internally developed financially disciplined approach for acquisitions to grow our company. We believe there are many potential targets in the range of $3 million to $10 million in annual revenues that can be acquired over time and integrated into our businesses. We will also look at larger, more transformational acquisitions if we believe the appropriate mix of value, risk and return is present for our shareholders. The timing of these potential acquisitions will always depend on market conditions, available capital, and the value for each transaction. In general, we want to be “value” buyers, and will not pursue any transaction unless we believe the post-transaction potential value is high for shareholders. 

History of our Business
We have grown both organically and through acquisitions over the last three years. The following table provides a summary of the acquisitions over the last three years:

Name | Date | Descriptions 
MD Office Solutions ("MD Office") | March 2015 | Acquired MD Office, a provider of mobile nuclear imaging in Northern and Central California and included operations in our Diagnostic Services reportable segment. 
Project Rendezvous Holding Corporation ("PRHC") | January 2016 | Acquired PRHC, the ultimate parent company of DMS Health Technologies, Inc. (collectively referred to hereinafter as "DMS Health Technologies" or "DMS Health"). DMS Health is a provider of mobile diagnostic imaging services and provides medical product sales and service. The acquisition resulted in two new reportable segments: Mobile Healthcare and Medical Device Sales and Services. 

Business Segments
As of December 31, 2017, our business is organized into four reportable segments: Diagnostic Services, Mobile Healthcare, Diagnostic Imaging and Medical Device Sales and Services. See Note 13 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for financial data relating to our segments. For discussion purposes, we categorized our Diagnostic Services and Mobile Healthcare reportable segments as “Services,” and our Diagnostic Imaging and Medical Devices Sales and Services reportable segments as “Product and Product-Related.” For the last three fiscal years, Services and Product and Product-Related activities had the following relative contribution to consolidated revenues: 

 | Year ended December 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Revenues: | | | | | 
Services | 77.6 | % | | 76.1 | % | 76.3 | %
Product and product-related | 22.4 | % | | 23.9 | % | 23.7 | %
Total revenues | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

Prior to the year ended December 31, 2016, we were organized as two reportable segments: Diagnostic Services and Diagnostic Imaging. With the acquisition of DMS Health on January 1, 2016, we added two additional reportable segments: Mobile Healthcare and Medical Device Sales and Services.

Diagnostic Services
Nuclear and Ultrasound Imaging Services.
Through Diagnostic Services, we offer a convenient and economically efficient imaging and monitoring services program as an alternative to purchasing equipment or outsourcing the procedures to another physician or imaging center. For physicians who wish to perform nuclear imaging, echocardiography, vascular or general ultrasound tests, we provide imaging systems, qualified personnel, radiopharmaceuticals, licensing services, and the logistics required to perform imaging in their own offices, and thereby the ability to bill Medicare, Medicaid, or one of the third-party healthcare insurers directly for those services, which are primarily cardiac in nature. We provide imaging services primarily to cardiologists, internal medicine physicians, and family practice doctors who typically enter annual contracts for a set number of days ranging from once per month to five times per week. Many of our physician customers are reliant on reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, and third-party insurers. Although reimbursement for procedures provided by our services have been stable during the last several years, any future changes to underlying reimbursements may require modifications to our current business model in order for us to maintain a viable economic model.
Our portable nuclear and ultrasound imaging operations utilize a “hub and spoke” model in which centrally located regional hubs anchor multiple van routes in the surrounding metropolitan areas. At these hubs, clinical personnel load the equipment, radiopharmaceuticals, and other supplies onto specially equipped vans for transport to customer locations, where they set up the equipment for the day. After quality assurance testing, a technologist under the physician’s supervision will gather patient information, inject the patient with a radiopharmaceutical, and then acquire images for interpretation by the physician. At the conclusion of the day of service, all equipment and supplies are removed from the customer location and transported back to the central hub location. Our model relies on density and customer concentration to allow for efficiencies and maximum profitability, and therefore we are only located in geographies where there is a high concentration of people, cardiac disease and associated likely customer locations.
For our nuclear imaging services, we have obtained Intersocietal Accreditation Commission ("IAC") and Intersocietal Commission for Echocardiography Laboratories ("ICAEL") accreditation for our services. Our licensing infrastructure provides radioactive materials licensing, radiation safety officer services, radiation safety training, monitoring and compliance policies and procedures, and quality assurance functions, to ensure adherence to applicable state and federal nuclear regulations. 
Cardiac Event Monitoring Services
We also offer within Diagnostic Services remote cardiac event monitoring services through our Telerhythmics business. These services include provision of a monitor, remote monitoring by registered nurses, and 24 hours a day, 7 days a week monitoring support for our patients and physician customers. We offer modalities of mobile cardiac telemetry ("MCT"), mobile cardiac event monitoring (both in wireless and analog versions), holter monitoring, and pacemaker analysis. Providing these services offers flexibility and convenience to our customers who do not have to incur the costs of staffing, equipment, and logistics to monitor patients as part of their standard of care. 
Our monitoring service operates out of a centralized monitoring center located near Memphis, Tennessee. From this location, the majority of monitoring equipment is shipped directly to patient homes once they are enrolled in our service. Patients hook up the equipment with easy to follow instructions, as well as assistance from our monitoring center. Once they are hooked up to the monitoring device, patients are monitored for a period of time ranging from 7 to 30 days. At the conclusion of the monitoring period, the equipment is packaged up and sent back to our monitoring center, after which the equipment is redeployed to the next patient.
Our cardiac event monitoring services are provided primarily through an independent diagnostic testing facility model that allows us to bill Medicare, Medicaid, or one of the third-party healthcare insurers directly for services provided, and is the only business at Digirad that bills Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance directly. As such, our cardiac event monitoring services are directly subject to reimbursements from these entities which are subject to change on a periodic basis. Typically, our contracts can be canceled at any time, and are generally present to create understanding on billing responsibilities.

Mobile Healthcare
Through Mobile Healthcare, we provide contract diagnostic imaging, including computerized tomography (“CT”), magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”), positron emission tomography (“PET”), PET/CT, and nuclear medicine and healthcare expertise to hospitals, integrated delivery networks (“IDNs”), and federal institutions on a long-term contract basis, as well as provisional (short-term) services to institutions that are in transition. These services are provided primarily when there is a cost, ease, and efficiency component of providing the services directly rather than owning and operating the related services and equipment directly by our customers.
Our Mobile Healthcare operations operate throughout the United States, with a heavier concentration in rural areas, particularly in the Upper Midwest region of the United States. We have a range of customer types, but our most typical customer is a small or regional hospital that does not have enough volume of activity to justify owning a piece of imaging equipment on a full-time basis. Our services typically offer the diagnostic imaging equipment, placed in a large patient friendly coach or tractor-trailer, coupled with either an owned or operator-owned tractor, that is then transported to each customer location. Our mobile routes are designed to provide for maximum utilization and efficiency by allowing our units to travel to the next customer location during non-working hours of a typical imaging clinic, meeting our technical staff at each location. Our customers commit to annual contracts ranging from service once every two weeks to up to two days of service per week, depending on modality type and their local demand for services.
Diagnostic Imaging
Through Diagnostic Imaging, we sell our internally developed solid-state gamma cameras, imaging systems and camera maintenance contracts. Our imaging systems include nuclear cardiac imaging systems, as well as general purpose nuclear imaging systems. We sell our imaging systems to physician offices and hospitals primarily in the United States, although we have sold a small number of imaging systems internationally. Our imaging systems are sold in both portable and fixed configurations, provide enhanced operability and improved patient comfort, fit easily into floor spaces as small as seven feet by eight feet, and facilitate the delivery of nuclear medicine procedures in a physician’s office, an outpatient hospital setting, or within multiple departments of a hospital (e.g., emergency and operating rooms). Our Diagnostic Imaging segment revenues derive primarily from selling solid-state gamma cameras and post-warranty camera maintenance contracts. 
The central component of a nuclear camera is the detector, which ultimately determines the overall clinical quality of images a camera produces. Our nuclear cameras feature detectors with advanced proprietary solid-state technology developed by us. Solid-state systems have a number of benefits over conventional photomultiplier tube-based camera designs typically offered by our competitors. Our solid-state technology systems are typically 2 to 5 times lighter and considerably more compact than most traditional nuclear systems, making them far easier and less costly to build, very reliable, and able to be utilized for mobile applications. We are a market leader in the mobile solid-state nuclear camera segment.
We believe our current imaging systems, with their state-of-the-art technology and robust underlying patents, will continue to be relevant for the foreseeable future. We will continue to enhance and adjust our existing systems for the changing nuclear imaging market, including software updates and smaller enhancements. However, to accomplish any significant changes and enhancements, we will utilize what we believe is a deep available pool of contract engineers on a flexible, as needed basis and do not maintain a staff research and development department, thereby eliminating the fixed costs of a fully staffed research and development department.
Medical Device Sales and Services 
Through Medical Device Sales and Service (“MDSS”), we provided: (a) contract sales services and (b) warranty and post-warranty services, under our contracts with Philips Healthcare (“Philips”), within a defined region in the upper Midwest region of the United States. Under the contract sales services, we primarily sold Philips branded imaging and patient monitoring systems, including CT, MRI, PET, PET/CT systems, ultrasound and patient and monitoring systems, and received a commission on these sales. For our equipment contract sales services, we did not take title to the underlying equipment; it was delivered directly to the end user by Philips. Under our warranty and post-warranty services, we provided warranty and post-warranty services on certain Philips equipment within this territory related to equipment we sold or other equipment sold in the territory.
On September 28, 2017, we received a notice of termination (the “Termination Notice”) from Philips that the Consolidated Agreement, dated April 1, 2014, as amended on June 9, 2015, between Philips and DMS Health Technologies ("DMS"), and the Remote Inside Sales Services Agreement dated March 23, 2016 (collectively, the "Philips Agreements"), were terminated upon the close of business on December 31, 2017 (the “Philips Termination”). The impact of the Termination Notice was to (a) end our contract sales services relationship with Philips as of December 31, 2017, effectively ending revenue associated with these services, and (b) end our relationship and support under our warranty and post-warranty services in the upper Midwest territory with Philips. However, the Philips Termination did not impact our ability to continue to service our existing contracts and allowed us opportunities to enter into new service contracts with customers outside the territory we were previously constrained to. 
5

Based on the Philips Termination, we carefully considered the opportunity to run the post-warranty service business outside the relationship with Philips, but determined that ultimately due to pricing challenges and logistics, the best economic decision was to sell the business to Philips. Therefore, on December 22, 2017, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Philips Purchase Agreement”) with Philips to sell all of our MDSS customer contracts relating to the post-warranty service business for $8.0 million (the “Philips Transaction”). The Philips Transaction is subject to certain post-closing adjustments. In connection with entering into the Philips Purchase Agreement, we entered into an agreement with Philips pursuant to which we continued to provide installation and warranty services pursuant to an existing Service Agreement until January 31, 2018. On February 1, 2018, the Philips Transaction was closed. Following the closing, the Company's MDSS reportable segment ceased to exist. As a result, in 2018, the MDSS reportable segment is expected to be reported as discontinued operations. 
Market Opportunity
Diagnostic imaging depictions of the internal anatomy or physiology are generated primarily through non-invasive means. Diagnostic imaging facilitates the early diagnosis of diseases and disorders, often minimizing the scope, cost, and amount of care required and reducing the need for more invasive procedures. Currently, the major types of non-invasive diagnostic imaging technologies available are: x-ray, MRI, CT, ultrasound, PET, and nuclear imaging. The most widely used imaging acquisition technology utilizing gamma cameras is single photon emission computed tomography, or SPECT. All our current internally-developed cardiac gamma cameras employ SPECT technology. 
Cardiac event monitoring is a diagnostic test that allows physicians to see the electrocardiogram ("ECG") of a patient’s heart rhythm over a period of time or related to a specific event. The test includes a small monitor that is worn on the patient’s waist and is connected to lead wires affixed to the patient’s chest. The purpose of this test is to capture infrequent heart conditions that may only be experienced outside a physician’s office, as well as to observe the state of the heart in various resting and active situations.
Diagnostic imaging is the standard of care in diagnosis of diseases and disorders. We offer, through our businesses, the majority of these diagnostic imaging modalities. All of the diagnostic imaging modalities that we offer (both from provision of services and product sales) have been consistently utilized in clinical applications for many years, and are stable in their use and need. By offering a wide array of these modalities, we believe that we have strategically diversified our operations in possible changing trends of utilization of one diagnostic imaging modality from another.
Competition
The market for diagnostic products and services is highly competitive. Our business, which is focused primarily on the private practice and hospital sectors, continues to face challenges of demand for diagnostic services and imaging equipment, which we believe is due in part to the impact of the Deficit Reduction Act on the reimbursement environment and the 2010 Healthcare Reform laws, as well as general uncertainty in overall healthcare and legislative changes in healthcare, such as the Affordable Care Act. These challenges have impacted, and will likely continue to impact, our operations. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include acceptance by hospitals and physicians, relationships that we develop with our customers, budget availability for our capital equipment, requirements for reimbursement, pricing, ease-of-use, reliability, and mobility.
Diagnostic Services. In providing Diagnostic Services imaging services, we compete against many smaller local and regional nuclear and/or ultrasound providers, often owner-operators that may have lower operating costs. The fixed-installation operators often utilize older, used equipment, and the mobile operators may use older Digirad single-head cameras or newer dual-head cameras. We are the only mobile provider with our own exclusive source of triple-head mobile systems. Some competing operators place new or used cameras into physician offices and then provide the staffing, supplies, and other support as an alternative to a Diagnostic Services service contract. In addition, we compete against imaging centers that install fixed nuclear gamma cameras and make them available to referring physicians in their geographic vicinity. In these cases, the physician sends their patients to the imaging center.
In providing cardiac event monitoring services, we compete against many smaller local and regional service providers, as well as a few larger, more well established medical device companies that provide devices and a service model similar to ours. We believe our advantage in this market is our ability to utilize almost any cardiac event device on the market in the United States, and not being constrained by using any particular device. However, our larger competitors have larger sales forces and deeper financial resources that may allow them to be more cost effective. Further, larger competitors may develop devices that may make our owned devices obsolete, causing us to suffer financial losses as we attempt to change our technology and service model to adapt.
Diagnostic Imaging. In selling our imaging systems, we compete against several large medical device manufacturers who offer a full line of imaging cameras for each diagnostic imaging technology, including x-ray, MRI, CT, ultrasound, nuclear medicine, or SPECT/CT and PET/CT hybrid imagers. The existing nuclear imaging systems sold by these competitors have been in use for a longer period of time than internally developed nuclear gamma cameras, and are more widely recognized and used by physicians 
6

and hospitals for nuclear imaging; however, they are generally not solid-state, lightweight, as flexible, or portable. Additionally, certain medical device companies have developed a version of solid-state gamma cameras that may directly compete with our product offerings. Many of the larger multi-modality competitors enjoy significant competitive advantages over us, including greater brand recognition, greater financial and technical resources, established relationships with healthcare professionals, broader distribution networks, more resources for product development and marketing and sales, and the ability to bundle products to offer discounts.
Mobile Healthcare. The market for selling, servicing and operating diagnostic imaging services, patient monitoring equipment and imaging systems is highly competitive. In providing our Mobile Healthcare services, we compete against a few large national and regional providers. In addition to direct competition from other providers of services similar to those offered by us, we compete with freestanding imaging centers and health care providers that have their own diagnostic imaging systems, as well as with equipment manufacturers that sell imaging equipment directly to healthcare providers for permanent installation. Some of the direct competitors, which provide contract MRI and PET/CT services, have access to greater financial resources than we do. In addition, some of our customers are capable of providing the same services we provide to their patients directly, subject only to their decision to acquire a high-cost diagnostic imaging system, assume the financial and technology risk, and employ the necessary technologists, rather than obtain equipment and services from us. We may also experience greater competition in states that currently have certificate of need laws if such laws were repealed, thereby reducing barriers to entry and competition in those states. We also compete against other similar providers in quality of services, quality of imaging systems, relationships with health care providers, knowledge and service quality of technologists, price, availability, and reliability.
Medical Device Sales and Services. Through our relationship with Philips Healthcare, we provided contract sales services of larger imaging systems and patient monitoring systems, as well as certain post warranty service contracts within a defined region in the upper Midwest region of the United States. For the imaging systems, we competed directly with other well-established healthcare products companies in the United States and throughout the world that sell similar devices that may have had a differing array of features and benefits that exceed the Philips products that we sold. Further, these competitors may have had a greater manufacturing capacity, reach and sales forces relative to the region we sold in, providing a competitive advantage.
For our post warranty service contracts, we compete with a variety of smaller and larger independent service providers that may pay their field staff lower wages, utilize used parts instead of OEM parts and fail to provide the training we provide. Competing with these entities sometimes puts us at a cost and price disadvantage. 
See discussion above under “Medical Device Sales and Services” related changes with the MDSS reportable segment.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements, and other measures to protect our intellectual property. We require our employees, consultants, and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements and to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the workday, using our property, or which relate to our business. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
Patents
We have developed a patent portfolio that covers our products, components, and processes. We have 28 issued U.S. patents. The patents cover, among other things, aspects of solid-state radiation detectors, including our photodiodes, signal processing, and system configuration. Our issued patents expire between July 3, 2017 and August 27, 2030. We have multiple patents covering unique aspects and improvements for many of our products. We have entered into royalty-bearing licenses for several U.S. patents with third parties, where we are the licensee, for exclusive or non-exclusive use in nuclear imaging (subject to certain reservation of rights by the U.S. Government). While each of our patents applies to nuclear medicine, many also apply to the construction of area detectors for other types of medical and non-medical imagers and imaging methods.
Trademarks and Copyrights
We hold a variety of trademark registrations and copyrights in the United States for our product sales and mobile operations. 
Raw Materials
Diagnostic Imaging. We and our contract manufacturers use a wide variety of materials, metals, and mechanical and electrical components for production of our nuclear imaging gamma cameras. These materials are primarily purchased from external suppliers, some of which are single-source suppliers. Materials are purchased from selected suppliers based on quality assurance, cost effectiveness, and constraints resulting from regulatory requirements, and we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. Global commodity supply and demand can ultimately affect pricing of certain of these raw materials. Though we believe we have adequate available sources of raw materials, there can be 
7

no guarantee that we will be able to access the quantity of raw material needed to sustain operations, as well as at a cost-effective price.
Diagnostic Services and Mobile Healthcare. Our Diagnostic Services and Mobile Healthcare operations utilize radiopharmaceuticals for our nuclear services. The underlying raw material for creation of the array of doses utilized in nuclear medicine is produced from a total of five main production facilities throughout the world, typically from highly enriched uranium resources. Prior to 2016, there were a total of six of these world sources; one source, Chalk River, Canada, ceased its production of these raw materials as planned in 2016. The remaining resources have been and are expected to continue to produce enough raw materials to address the global market, but there continues to be pressure to utilize low or non-enriched uranium resources to produce the underlying nuclear doses. 
Manufacturing
Diagnostic Imaging. We manufacture our nuclear imaging gamma cameras by employing a strategy that combines using internal manufacturing resources for devices requiring specific expertise due to our proprietary design coupled with qualified contract manufacturers. Mechanical and electronic components of our systems are produced by contract manufacturers, whereas the most complex components, final assembly and final system performance tests are performed at our facility. All of our suppliers of critical materials, components, and subassemblies undergo supplier qualifications and ongoing quality audits in accordance with our supplier quality process.
We and our contract manufacturers are subject to FDA Quality System Regulations, state regulations, and standards set by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO. We are currently certified to the EN ISO 13485:2012 quality standard. We have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") 510(k) clearance for our complete nuclear imaging camera product line [Cardius® XPO, Cardius® X-ACT, and Ergo™ gamma cameras]. In addition, the X-ACT camera utilizes an x-ray technology to provide attenuation correction information for the SPECT reconstruction. We also have received additional FDA clearance of our Ergo™ large-field-of-view General Purpose Imager for use in intraoperative and molecular breast imaging.
Reimbursement
Our only businesses that bills Medicare, Medicaid and private payors directly is our cardiac event monitoring services business; however, all of our customers typically rely primarily on the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private payors for reimbursement. As a result, demand for our products and services are dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these payors. Third party coverage and reimbursement is subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign regulation, and private payor rules and policies. In many instances, the applicable regulations, policies, and rules have not been definitively interpreted by regulatory authorities or the courts, are open to a variety of interpretations, and are subject to change without notice.
The scope of coverage and payment policies vary among third-party private payors. For example, some payors will not reimburse a provider unless the provider has a contract with the payor, and in many instances such payors will not enter into such contracts without the approval of a third party “radiology benefit manager” that the payor compensates based on reducing the payor’s imaging expense. Other payors prohibit reimbursement unless physicians own or lease our cameras on a full-time basis, or meet certain accreditation or privileging standards. Such payor requirements and limitations can significantly restrict the types of business models we can successfully utilize.
Medicare reimbursement rules are subject to annual changes that may affect payment for services that our customers provide. In addition, Congress has passed healthcare reform proposals that are intended to expand the availability of healthcare coverage and reduce the growth in healthcare spending in the U.S. Many of these laws affect the services that our customers provide, and could change further over time.
Medicare reimbursement rules impose many standards and policies on the payment of services that our customers provide. For instance, physicians billing for the technical component of nuclear imaging tests must be accredited by a government-approved independent accreditation body and many private payors are adopting similar requirements. We offer our customers a service to assist them in obtaining and maintaining the required accreditation. We believe we have structured our contracts in a manner that allows our customers to seek reimbursement from third-party payors in compliance with Medicare reimbursement rules. Our physician customers typically bill for both the technical and professional components of the tests. Assuming they meet certain requirements including, but not limited to, performing and documenting bona fide interpretations and providing the requisite supervision of the non-physician personnel performing the tests, they may bill and be paid by Medicare. If the failure to comply is deemed to be “knowing” or “willful,” the government could seek to impose fines or penalties, and we may be required to restructure our agreements and/or respond to any resultant claims by such customers or the government. Our hospital customers typically seek reimbursement by Medicare for outpatient services under the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System.
8

Sales
We maintain separate sales organizations that are aligned with each of our business units, which operate independently but in cooperation with each other. Mobile Healthcare sales efforts are throughout the United States and Canada, though there typically is more effort expended in rural and smaller hospital areas, as these are the primary customers that we sell our services to and provide the most value. Diagnostic Services concentrates its efforts on twelve regional areas where the majority of our business is concentrated based on concentrations of people and cardiac disease. Diagnostic Imaging sales efforts are conducted throughout the United States and certain foreign countries, and are not concentrated to any particular region or area within the United States as the customer profile for this business can be at any hospital or physician practice. Diagnostic Services and Diagnostic Imaging, though separate sales teams, work collaboratively to help fulfill customer needs in either small practice mobile nuclear cardiac imaging services, or the potential to provide capital equipment sales should the customer decide to own the equipment in house. Traditionally, Medical Device Sales and Services concentrated its sales efforts in the Upper Midwest area of the United States based on our sales and service agreement with Philips. Similar to Diagnostic Imaging and Diagnostic Services, the sales teams of Mobile Healthcare and Medical Device Sales and Services worked collaboratively to field opportunities that could result in both the sale of capital equipment and/or an opportunity for mobile services to provide solutions for our customers in large imaging modalities to fit their needs. See discussion above under “Medical Device Sales and Services” related changes with the MDSS reportable segment.
Government Regulation
We and our medical professional customers and must comply with an array of federal and state laws and regulations. Violations of such laws and regulations can be punishable by criminal, civil, and/or administrative sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Accordingly, we maintain a vigorous compliance program and a hotline that permits our personnel to report violations anonymously if they wish.
The following is a summary of some of the laws and regulations applicable to our business:

• | Anti-Kickback Laws. The Medicare/Medicaid Patient Protection Act of 1987, as amended, which is commonly referred to as the Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibits us from knowingly and willingly offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any form of remuneration in return for the referral of items or services, or to purchase, lease, order, or arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, service, or item, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program. Violation of the federal anti-kickback law is a felony, punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, or both, and can result in civil penalties and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted similar statutes prohibiting payments intended to induce referrals of products or services paid by Medicaid or other nongovernmental third-party payors.


• | Physician Self-Referral Laws. Federal regulations commonly referred to as the “Stark Law” prohibit physician referrals of Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity for certain designated health services if the physician or an immediate family member has an indirect or direct financial relationship with the entity, unless a statutory exception applies. We believe that referrals made by our physician customers are eligible to qualify for the “in-office ancillary services” exception to the Stark Law, provided that the services are provided or supervised by the physician or a member of his or her “Group Practice,” as that term is defined under the law, the services are performed in the same building in which the physician regularly practices medicine, and the services are billed by or for the supervising physician or Group Practice. Violations of the Stark Law may lead to the imposition of penalties and fines, the exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and liability under the federal False Claims Act and its whistleblower provisions. Many states have adopted similar statutes prohibiting self-referral arrangements that cover all patients and not just Medicare and Medicaid patients.


• | HIPAA. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits schemes to defraud healthcare benefit programs and fraudulent conduct in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services. HIPAA also establishes standards governing electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information. Some states have also enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, enacted February 17, 2009, made significant changes to HIPAA privacy and security regulations. Effective February 17, 2010, we are regulated directly under all of the HIPAA rules protecting the security of electronic individually identifiable health information and many of the rules governing the privacy of such information.

• | Medical Device Regulation. The FDA classifies medical devices, such as our cameras, into one of three classes, depending on the degree of risk associated with the device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are placed in either class I or II, which generally requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification requesting permission for commercial distribution. This process is known as 510(k)

9

clearance. Devices deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices, are placed in Class III, requiring an approved Premarket Approval Application ("PMA"). Our cameras are Class II medical devices that have been cleared for marketing by the FDA. We are also subject to post-market regulatory requirements relating to our manufacturing process, marketing and sales activities, product performance, and medical device reports should there be deaths and serious injuries associated with our products.

• | Pharmaceutical Regulation. Federal and state agencies, including the FDA and state pharmacy boards, regulate the radiopharmaceuticals used in our Diagnostic Services business.


• | Radioactive Materials Laws. We must maintain licensure under, and comply with, federal and state radioactive materials laws, or RAM laws.
