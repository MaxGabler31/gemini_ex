IMPACT OF COVID-19
The outbreak of the novel strain of Coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and the impact of the variants has created significant impacts and disruptions to the U.S. and global economies and are likely to do so for the foreseeable future. We expect that COVID-19 will continue to adversely affect portions of our business, including our global supply chain and manufacturing operations. We experienced reductions in customer demand in certain of our served markets and increases in demand in other of these markets during the periods of 2020 and 2021 due to the impact of COVID-19. The net result was a record level of total bookings in 2021. The operational ability of our suppliers to provide the necessary quantity of materials on a timely basis has been reduced, which has impacted the predictability of our global supply chain, and resulted in some increased costs to secure and place materials into production and forced us to delay product shipments. Throughout 2022, we expect the impact of COVID-19 on our operations will continue to challenge certain aspects of our business, particularly our global supply chain and our ability to hire direct labor. Certain materials and components used in our products are required and qualified to be sourced from a single or a limited number of suppliers. Any interruption in the supply from any supplier that serves as a sole source could delay product shipments and have a material adverse effect on our business.
In response to COVID-19, we have taken and will continue to take proactive, aggressive action to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and communities. We continue to follow rigorous safety 

4



measures in all of our sites, including social distancing protocols, incorporating a work from home model at certain times for those employees that do not need to be physically present to perform their work, limiting travel, implementing temperature checks at the entrances to our facilities, extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces and providing masks and other protective equipment to those employees who must be physically present. These measures have been implemented on a worldwide basis and have been adjusted prudently as requirements and conditions change. We will continue to monitor and act in accordance with government authorities requirements or recommendations and evolving best practices.
Our Company provides essential and important products, including some that our customers rely on to address COVID-19. We manufacture and deliver critical motion control components, including electronic drives, motors and control assemblies to manufacturers of medical equipment including respirators, ventilators, infusion pumps, medical fluid pumps and other breathing assist equipment required to care for patients with respiratory issues including COVID-19. We are a long-term, qualified supplier to leading medical device manufacturers of ventilators and respirators around the world.
Global demand and capacity to produce ventilators increased significantly during portions of 2020, and we supplied the critical motion control components for the ventilators. The Company rapidly deployed resources to increase production capacity to meet the surge in demand that has been experienced for certain types of medical products related to combatting the COVID-19 virus. While the demand for certain items, such as ventilators, has returned to normalized levels in 2021, we continue to provide solutions to suppliers of other types of medical equipment, including surgical tools and equipment, surgical robots, diagnostic equipment, test equipment, patient mobility and rehabilitation equipment, hospital beds and mobile equipment carts. 
Our worldwide locations are considered to be essential suppliers to our customers and therefore most of our locations have remained substantially operational throughout the outbreak while implementing the enhanced safety procedures. 
We have taken actions since the beginning of the pandemic to strengthen our liquidity and financial condition. We renewed and increased our revolving credit facility to $225 million through February 2025 (refer to Note 7, Debt Obligations from our consolidated financial statements). Through this amendment we lowered our cost of debt, and secured more favorable covenants. This liquidity preserves our financial flexibility during the pandemic and subsequent to it. We believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity are sufficient to support our short and long-term liquidity needs.
To conserve cash and maximize operational efficiency while supporting growth plans, we continue to align variable costs with demand, maintain and enhance key engineering capabilities, and control discretionary spending. The Company continues to closely monitor events and conditions resulting from COVID-19.
The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our operational and financial performance will continue to depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the virus and variants, the potential for additional waves, its impact on our customers, suppliers and the range of governmental reactions to the pandemic, which cannot be predicted at this time. We will continue to proactively respond to the situation and will take further actions as warranted to alter our business operations as necessary. 

Recent Events
The current conflict in Ukraine has created general economic uncertainty with regard to energy prices, interest rates and our supply chain. We are monitoring the developments as they unfold in order to react accordingly. The impact of the conflict on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments that cannot be predicted, the Company does not believe the impacts to be material at this time. 
During the last half of 2021, certain regions of China experienced energy shortages which impacted our facilities. One of our China locations was shut down for one week as a result of the restrictions on energy usage imposed by the Chinese government. The impact was not material to our results during 2021, however, there continue to be uncertainties related to the energy shortages that may impact us in 2022 and beyond. We have been able to proactively 

5



mitigate the impact of the restrictions on energy usage to date by managing our scheduling at the impacted facilities.
Twinsburg Consolidation
In September 2021, the Company announced its plans to consolidate its manufacturing facility in Twinsburg, Ohio with its Watertown, New York and Reynosa, Mexico facilities in 2022. Costs of $545 are included in business development on the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the consolidation of the Twinsburg facility. Total costs of approximately $1,000 are expected to be incurred in connection with this initiative and will include accelerated lease costs, severance and other payroll related costs, legal costs, accelerated depreciation, and costs to relocate inventory and machinery and equipment. This initiative is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2022.
Stock Split
On April 30, 2021, we effected a 3-for-2 stock split. References to numbers of shares of common stock and per share data have been adjusted to reflect the stock split on a retrospective basis. Refer to Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further information.
Cyber Breach
During the second quarter 2021, we were the subject of a cyber security breach. We discovered the issue soon after the intrusion and implemented our contingency and disaster recovery plans, including engaging legal, security and forensic experts in this field. We were able to contain the issue and were successful in getting our operations back up and running without a material impact to our results. We have implemented additional security measures that further safeguard our systems. No ransom was paid related to this breach.

OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING OUR OPERATIONS
Sales and Marketing
We design and develop our products within our Technology Centers and can manufacture these products in various facilities located in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Asia-Pacific. We also operate Allied Motion Solution Centers that evaluate and focus all Allied Motion products to create integrated controlled motion solutions for our customers. We sell our products and solutions globally to a broad spectrum of customers through our own direct sales force and authorized manufacturers’ representatives and distributors. Our customers include end users and original 

7



equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”).
Allied Motion Sales Organization:
The Company’s sales organization is focused on becoming the best sales and service force in its industry. Through the One Team approach for providing controlled motion solutions and components that best address customers’ needs, the Company has broadened the knowledge and skills of its direct sales force, while creating sales and service support in its Solution Centers. This enables the entire sales organization to be capable of selling all products designed, developed and produced by Allied Motion globally. The Company’s primary channels to market include the direct sales force and external authorized Sales Representatives, Agents and Distributors that provide field coverage in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Canada, Israel and the Americas. While the majority of the Company’s sales are directly to OEMs, it is working to expand its market reach through Distribution channels.
Allied Motion Solution Centers: 
Allied Motion has Solution Centers in China, Europe and North America that enable the design and sale of individual component products as well as integrated controlled motion systems that utilize multiple Allied Motion products and technology. In addition to providing sales and applications support, the solution center function may include final assembly, integration and tests as required to support customers within their geographic region.
Sales Backlog:
Backlog as of December 31, 2021 was $249,927 compared with $141,344 as of December 31, 2020. Included in backlog as of December 31, 2021 is $47,934 from the acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. The time to convert the majority of backlog to sales is approximately three to nine months. Given the short product lead times, we do not believe that the amount of our backlog of orders is a reliable indication of our future sales. We may on occasion receive multi-year orders from customers for product to be delivered on demand over that time frame. There is no assurance that the Company’s backlog from these customers will be converted into revenue.
Major Customer
Sales to one customer were 15% of total sales in 2021 and 2020. We believe the diversification of the target markets we serve reduces our exposure to negative developments with any single customer.
Competitive Environment
Our products and solutions are sold into the global market with a large and diverse group of competitors that vary by product, geography, industry and application. We believe the controlled motion market is highly fragmented with many competitors, some of which are substantially larger and have greater resources than Allied Motion. We believe our competitive advantages include our electro-magnetic, mechanical and electronic controlled motion expertise, the breadth of our motor technologies and our ability to integrate these technologies with our encoders, gearing, power electronics, digital control technologies and network/feedback communications capabilities, as well as our global presence. Unlike many of our competitors, we are unique in our ability to provide custom-engineered controlled motion solutions that integrate the products we manufacture such as embedded or external electrical control solutions with our motors. We compete on technological capabilities, quality, reliability, service responsiveness, delivery speed and price. Our competitors include Altra Industrial Motion Corp., Ametek, Inc., Parker Hannifin Corporation and other smaller competitors.
Availability and Prices of Parts and Raw Materials
We purchase critical raw materials from a limited number of suppliers due to the technically challenging requirements of the supplied product and/or the lengthy process required to qualify these materials both internally and with our customers. We cannot quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for these materials in some cases because of these rigid requirements. For these critical raw materials, we maintain minimum safety stock levels and partner with suppliers through contract to help ensure the continuity of supply. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic and supply chain disruptions, we continue to face upward pricing pressure on parts and raw materials. This 

8



has also resulted in increased operational challenges from workplace disruptions and restrictions on the movement of raw materials and goods, both at our own facilities and at our customers and suppliers, leading to increases in prices and freight costs. As we seek to secure supply during these uncertain times, we have proactively increased the levels of certain inventories to put us in the position to meet the needs of our customers.
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions
We hold a number of patents and trademarks for components manufactured by our various subsidiaries, and we have several patents pending on new products recently developed, which are considered to be of significance.
Working Capital Items
We currently maintain inventory levels adequate for our short-term needs based upon present levels of production. We consider the component parts of our different product lines to be generally available and current suppliers to be reliable and capable of satisfying anticipated needs under normal conditions. As discussed herein, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions, we have experienced increased costs and have purposely increased certain inventories to deal with global supply chain issues.
Engineering and Development Activities
Our engineering and development (E&D) activities are for the development of new products, enhancement of the functionality, effectiveness and reliability of current products, to redesign products to reduce the cost of manufacturing of products or to expand the types of applications for which our products and solutions can be used. Our engineering and development expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $27,818 and $25,487, respectively, or 7% of sales in 2021 and 2020. We believe E&D is critical to our success and expect to continue to invest at these levels in the future. Of these expenditures, no material amounts were charged directly to customers, although we record non-recurring engineering charges to certain customers for custom engineering required to develop products that meet the customer’s specifications.
Environmental Issues
No significant pollution or other types of hazardous emission result from the Company’s operations and it is not anticipated that our operations will be materially affected by Federal, State or local provisions concerning environmental controls. Our costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements are not material.
We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our business or markets that we serve, nor on our results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. The board of directors provide oversight as part of their environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) initiatives and we will continue to monitor emerging developments and assess our performance in this area.
International Operations
Our operations outside the United States are conducted through wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries and are located primarily in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Our international operations are subject to the usual risks inherent in international trade, including currency fluctuations, local government contracting regulations, local governmental restrictions on foreign investment and repatriation of profits, exchange controls, regulation of the import and distribution of foreign goods, as well as changing economic and social conditions in countries in which our operations are conducted. The information required by this item is set forth in Note 13, Segment Information, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.
