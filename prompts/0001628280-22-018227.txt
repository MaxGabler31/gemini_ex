Company Overview
American Software, Inc. (“American Software” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Georgia in 1970. The Company is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia with U.S. offices in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, St. Louis, Miami and San Diego; and international offices in the United Kingdom, India, Germany, New Zealand and Australia.
We provide our software and services solutions through three major operating segments; (1) Supply Chain Management (“SCM”), (2) Information Technology Consulting (“IT Consulting”) and (3) Other. The SCM software business is our core market. We also offer technology staffing and consulting services through our wholly-owned subsidiary, The Proven Method, Inc., in the IT Consulting segment, and we continue to provide limited services to our legacy enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) clients included in the Other segment.

American Software delivers an innovative technical platform that enables enterprises to accelerate their digital supply chain optimization from product concept to client availability via the Logility Digital Supply Chain Platform, a single platform spanning Product, Demand, Inventory, Supply and Deploy aligned with Integrated Business Planning. Our Logility Digital Supply Chain Platform includes advanced analytics and is fueled by supply chain master data, allowing for the automation of critical business processes through the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to a variety of internal and external data streams.
We believe enterprises are facing unprecedented rates of change and disruption across their operations. Increasing consumer expectations for convenience and personalization, fast and free delivery and product freshness are forcing enterprises to adapt or be left behind. Given constraints arising from a shortage of skilled supply chain talent and a desire to keep costs at a minimum, we expect enterprises to embrace digital transformation initiatives to meet these challenges. Our solution reduces the business cycle time required from product concept to client availability. Our platform allows our clients to create a digital model of their physical supply chain networks that improves the speed and agility of their operations by implementing automated planning processes. These processes continuously analyze business and market signals to better inform product design and development, increase forecast accuracy, optimize inventory across the supply chain source products sustainability and ethically, and ensure high client satisfaction.
Our platform is highly regarded by clients and industry analysts alike. We are named a leader in multiple IDC MarketScape reports including; the September 2020 report IDC MarketScape: Worldwide PLM Applications for Apparel, Footwear, and Retail Brands 2020 Vendor Assessment; the January 2020 report IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Supply Chain Supply Planning 2019 Vendor Assessment; and the January 2020 report IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Supply Chain Demand Planning 2019 Vendor Assessment.
We have been positioned in the Challenger quadrant in Gartner, Inc.’s (“Gartner”) May 17, 2022 report, Magic Quadrant for Supply Chain Planning Solutions. We believe our platform is rated highly due to our flexible advanced analytics, underlying Software as a Service (“SaaS”) architecture, ease of integration with third-party systems, lower total cost of ownership relative to competitors and the broad scope of supply chain planning functions supported.
We serve approximately 860 clients located in approximately 80 countries, largely concentrated within key vertical markets including apparel and other soft goods, food and beverage, consumer packaged goods, consumer durable goods, wholesale distribution, specialty chemical and other process manufacturing. Our solutions are marketed and sold through a direct sales team as well as an indirect global value-added reseller (“VAR”) distribution network. Our solutions may be deployed in the cloud or with existing on-premise clients who may require additional components. We further support our clients with an array of consulting, implementation, operational and training services as well as technical support and hosting.
We derive revenue from four sources: subscriptions, software licenses, maintenance and services. We generally determine SaaS subscription and software license fees based on the breadth of functionality and number of users and/or divisions. Services and other revenues consist primarily of fees from software implementation, training, consulting services, hosting and managed services. We bill for consulting services primarily under time and materials arrangements and recognize revenue as we perform services. Subscription and maintenance agreements typically are for a three- to five-year term. We generally bill these fees annually in advance and then recognize the resulting revenue ratably over the term of the agreement. Deferred revenues represent advance payments or fees for subscriptions, software licenses, services and maintenance billed in advance of the time we recognize the related revenue.
Market Opportunity

Today’s manufacturers, distributors and retailers must respond to rising consumer expectations to buy anywhere, deliver anywhere and return anywhere, even as global economic conditions and competitive pressures force businesses to reduce costs, decrease order cycle times and improve operating efficiencies. To meet these demands, we believe businesses must dramatically improve the performance of their supply chains, which can only be achieved through automation, artificial intelligence and advanced analytics. We leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms throughout our supply chain management software platform, enabling enterprises to accelerate the cycle time from product concept to client availability.
Supply chain management refers to the process of managing the complex global network of relationships that organizations maintain with external trading partners (clients and suppliers) to design products, forecast demand, source supply, manufacture products, distribute and allocate inventory and deliver goods and services to the end client. Supply chain management involves the activities related to sourcing and supplying and merchandising products or services as well as the sales and marketing activities that influence the demand for goods and services, such as new product introductions, promotions, pricing and forecasting. Additional aspects of supply chain management include comprehensive sales and operations planning (“S&OP”) as well as product lifecycle management (“PLM”), product sourcing quality and vendor compliance, to ensure the right products are brought to market on time and in good condition. Companies that effectively communicate, collaborate and integrate with their trading partners across the multi-enterprise network or supply chain can realize significant competitive advantages in the form of lower costs, greater customer loyalty, reduced stock-outs, more efficient sourcing, reduced inventory levels, synchronized supply and demand and increased revenue.
Gartner’s December 2021 report, Forecast: Enterprise Application Software, Worldwide, 2019-2025, 4Q21 Update, predicts spending on Supply Chain Management software solutions will exceed $20 billion in 2022 and reach $31 billion by 2025. This represents a compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 14.6% through 2025. Within the Supply Chain Management software market, Gartner includes solutions for supply chain planning, supply chain execution and procurement. 
We focus primarily on supply chain planning processes and certain procurement and sourcing functions, which we estimate account for approximately one-third of the Supply Chain Management software market as defined by Gartner. Our platform includes more than thirty components spanning seven key supply chain planning processes that clients may adopt independently or as a comprehensive solution platform. We believe our opportunity to cross-sell and up-sell existing clients is significant, given the potential for clients to adopt additional components over time. Within the sourcing function, organizations are increasing their focus on vendor compliance and sourcing linked with supply chain planning and other enterprise applications, in order to increase the efficient and effective fulfillment of customer orders in both the business-to-business and the business-to-consumer sectors. These multi-enterprise supply chains have heightened the need for robust supply chain master data management (“MDM”) to provide an accurate digital twin of the supply chain network, allowing enterprises to quickly plan strategically and accurately respond to dynamic market conditions to take advantage of business opportunities and mitigate risk.
Company Strategy
Our goal is to deliver the fastest time to value for our clients to achieve an agile, resilient and higher velocity sustainable supply chain. Our strategy includes the following key elements:
Create Sustainable Supply Chains for Our Clients. By enabling our clients to shorten their supply chains, reduce energy consumption, reduce water usage, increase the use of recyclable material, enforce proper labor practices and track products through their entire lifecycle, we enable them to achieve more sustainable operations and improve conditions in the world in which we live.

Expand Strategic Relationships. We are increasingly working with industry-leading consultants and other software and services providers. Our strategic partnerships help us to grow more quickly and to more efficiently deliver our products and services. We intend to continue to develop strategic relationships with systems integrators and other providers to combine our software solutions with their services and products and create joint marketing and co-development opportunities.
Acquire or Invest in Complementary Businesses, Products and Technologies. We believe that selective acquisitions or investments may offer opportunities to broaden our product offering for our target markets. We will evaluate acquisitions or investments that will provide us with complementary products and technologies, expand our geographic presence and distribution channels, penetrate additional vertical markets with challenges and requirements similar to those we currently meet, and further solidify our leadership position within the SCM market.
Products and Services
We provide a comprehensive, cloud-architected supply chain management platform that helps our clients manage seven critical planning processes, Product, Demand, Inventory, Supply, Deploy, Integrated Business Planning and Supply Chain Data Management. Within each of these process areas, we offer one or more components that clients may leverage independently, in combination, or as a comprehensive solution platform, either in the cloud or on-premise. Our supply chain MDM platform and advanced analytics capabilities enable clients to derive new insights and automate planning processes that continuously analyze demand, production, supply and distribution signals to inform product design and development, increase forecast accuracy, optimize inventory across the global supply chain and in-store, and ensure high client satisfaction.
While clients can use our software applications individually, we have designed them to be combined as integrated systems to meet specific client requirements. Clients may select virtually any combination of components to form an integrated solution for a particular business problem, from a single module to a multi-module, multiple-user solution incorporating our full range of products.
Our platform, which may be deployed as a hosted SaaS solution or on-premise, encompasses the following processes and associated components:
Product: Streamlines moving product concepts to market, rationalizes complex product lines, and drives smart assortment plans and allocation strategies. Includes merchandise and assortment planning, product lifecycle management, and traceability.

Supply Chain Data Management: Gains access to tailored data integration, machine learning and advanced analytics without the headaches of custom development. Includes data management, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and advanced analytics. 

Additional Products and Services
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, The Proven Method, Inc., we provide technology staffing and services to a diverse client base to solve business issues. These services include professional services, product management, and project management outsourcing; staff augmentation for cloud, collaboration, network and security; and social media and analytic marketing.
We also continue to provide software, support and services related to our legacy American Software ERP products, which include our e-Intelliprise solution and e-applications for various integrated business functions.
Client Support and Maintenance
We provide our clients with ongoing product support services, which are included in subscription fees. For licenses, we enter into support or maintenance contracts with clients for an initial one- to three-year term, billed annually in advance, with renewal for additional periods thereafter. Under both subscription and license contracts, we provide telephone consulting, product updates and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the client, as well as error reporting and correction services. We provide ongoing support and maintenance services on a seven-days-a-week, 24-hours-a-day basis through telephone, email and web-based support, using a call logging and tracking system for quality assurance.
Consulting Services
Clients frequently require services beyond our standard support and maintenance. To meet those clients’ needs, our professional services team provides specialized business and software implementation consulting, development and configuration, system-to-system interfacing and extensive training and certification. We offer these services for an additional fee, usually based upon time and materials utilized. We provide the following professional services to our clients:
Cloud Hosting and Managed Services. Our clients can deploy our solutions in a hosted or on-premise environment. Companies may choose and then adjust the deployment methodology and services that best suit their individual needs as their business changes and their IT strategies evolve. Managed Services leverage our resources to assist and augment the client’s technical and operational needs on a day-to-day basis. We also have some clients for which we operate the solution on a daily basis in support of their supply chain operations.
Implementation and Training Services. We offer our clients a professional and proven program that facilitates rapid implementation of our software products. Our consultants help clients define the nature of their project and proceed through the implementation process. We establish measurable financial and logistical performance indicators and then evaluate them for conformance during and after implementation. We offer training for all users and managers. Implementation of our products typically requires three to nine months, depending on factors such as the complexity of a client’s existing systems, breadth of functionality, and number of business units and users. 
We also offer our clients post-delivery professional services consisting primarily of implementation and training services, for which we typically charge on a daily basis. Clients that invest in implementation services receive assistance in integrating our solution with existing enterprise software applications and databases. Additional services may include post-implementation reviews and benchmarks to further enhance the benefits to clients, and training and user certification programs can help our clients gain even greater benefits from our robust planning platform.

No client accounted for more than 10% of fiscal 2022 revenue. We typically experience a slight degree of seasonality, reflected in a slowing of services revenue during the winter holiday season, which occurs in the third quarter of our fiscal year. We are not reliant on government-sector clients.
Competition
Our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions targeted at various aspects of the supply chain, retail and general enterprise application markets. Our existing competitors include, but are not limited to:
•Large ERP application software vendors such as SAP, Oracle and Infor, each of which offers sophisticated ERP solutions that currently, or may in the future, incorporate supply chain management, advanced planning and scheduling, warehouse management, transportation, collaboration or S&OP software components; 
•Vendors focusing on the supply chain application software market, including, but not limited to, Blue Yonder, o9 Solutions, Kinaxis and OM Partners; 
•Other business application software vendors that may broaden their product offerings by internally developing, acquiring or partnering with independent developers of supply chain management software; and 
•Internal development efforts by corporate information technology departments. 
We also expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the market for advanced retail planning and supply chain management software and/or introduce new products and technologies. In addition, current and potential competitors have made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties.
The principal competitive factors in the target markets in which we compete include product functionality and quality, domain expertise, integration technologies, product suite integration, breadth of products, and related services such as client support, training and implementation. Other factors important to clients and prospects include:
•customer service and satisfaction; 
•ability to provide relevant client references; 
•compliance with industry-specific requirements and standards; 
•flexibility to adapt to changing business requirements; 
•ability to generate business benefits; 
•rapid payback and measurable return on investment; 
•vendor financial stability and company and product reputation; and 
•initial price, cost to implement and long term total cost of ownership. 
We believe that our principal competitive advantages are our comprehensive, end-to-end solution platform, the ability of our solutions to quickly generate business benefits for our clients, our substantial investment in product development, our deep domain expertise, the ease of use of our software products, our client support and professional consulting services, our ability to deploy quickly, and our ability to deliver rapid return on investment for our clients.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our products globally through direct and indirect sales channels. We conduct our principal sales and marketing activities from our corporate headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, and have North American sales and/or support offices in Boston, Chicago, Dallas, St. Louis, Miami and San Diego. We manage sales and/or support outside of North America from our international offices in the United Kingdom, India, Germany, New Zealand and Australia.

In addition to our direct sales force, we have developed a network of VARs who assist in selling our products globally. We will continue to utilize these and future relationships with software and service organizations to enhance our sales and marketing position. Currently located in North America, South America, Mexico, Europe, South Africa, and the Asia/Pacific region, these independent distributors and resellers distribute our product lines domestically and in foreign countries. These vendors typically sell their own consulting and systems integration services in conjunction with contracts for our products. Our global distribution channel consists of 20 organizations with sales, implementation and support resources serving clients in approximately 80 countries.
Marketing and communications contribute significantly to our growth and the demand for our products and services in the market. We made significant changes in the last year to modernize the marketing department and increase focus on digital promotion. We raise market awareness of our brands and engage with the prospective market through concentrated marketing and communications programs. The consolidation of resources supporting the entire SCM business that has occurred over the last year will provide the Company with an opportunity to amplify a unique and market leading value proposition. We do this through a variety of marketing efforts, including public and media relations, direct marketing, advertising, events, and industry influencers. We also collaborate and participate in a variety of global industry associations, such as those organized by the Association for Supply Chain Management, the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals, and the Institute of Business Forecasting.
Research and Development
Our success depends in part upon our ability to continue to recognize and meet client needs, anticipate opportunities created by changing technology, adapt our products to the changing expectations of our client community, and keep pace with emerging industry standards. As a part of our ongoing commitment to these goals, we continue to focus on the people, processes, and technology that help to achieve them. We are committed to partnering with our clients in co-development efforts to ensure our products map well to market needs from day one. We are continually shortening release cycles to more rapidly respond to market opportunities. We leverage design thinking approaches to ensure that we understand not only the expressed needs of our clients, but also the lived realities of the people that use them to accomplish their supply chain goals each and every day.
We continue to leverage the opportunities presented by artificial intelligence, machine learning, advance analytics platforms, in-memory computing, and alternative data management approaches as well as advancing research efforts in the application of blockchain and other technologies with promise in supply chain use cases. Our research and development efforts will continue to focus on deploying solutions within a complex global supply chain landscape. Our cloud-architected solutions designed for SaaS deployment with master data management built in will be increasingly important for our long-term growth. As of April 30, 2022, we employed 104 persons in product research, development and enhancement activities. We also engage contractors for research and development, bringing our total human capital resources dedicated to research and development to 163 persons.
Proprietary Rights
Our success and ability to compete are dependent in part upon our proprietary technology. To protect this proprietary technology, we rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality obligations and other contractual provisions. However, we also believe that factors such as the knowledge, ability, and experience of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, reliable maintenance and timeliness and quality of support services are essential 

to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. The source code for our proprietary software is protected as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work. Generally, copyrights expire 95 years after the year of first publication. In addition, we have registered a number of trademarks in the U.S. and internationally and have applications pending for others. We enter into confidentiality or similar agreements with our employees, consultants and clients, control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information, and deliver only object code (compiled source code) to our licensed clients. As is customary in the software industry, in order to protect our intellectual property rights, we do not sell or transfer title to our products to our clients.
Human Capital Resources
As of April 30, 2022, we had 418 full-time employees, including 104 in product research, development and enhancement, 43 in client support, 151 in professional services, 75 in marketing, sales and sales support, and 45 in accounting, facilities and administration. Of these, 344 are based in the United States and 74 are based in our international locations. Our operations are further supported by over 100 independent full-time contractors who fulfill critical needs around the globe. We have never had a work stoppage and no employees or contractors are represented under collective bargaining arrangements.
Core Values. Our corporate culture is based on our core values: Passion, Accountability, Curiosity, and Teamwork. Employee performance and Company fit are assessed in part based on these core values. We reinforce them in employee communications and celebrate extraordinary examples of these values with quarterly “Living the Core Values” awards for employees nominated by colleagues and selected by the executive leadership team.
Diversity. American Software and its subsidiaries are enriched by the diverse, talented and highly skilled workforce that brings a variety of experiences and perspectives to address the needs of our team, Clients and shareholders. We make better decisions and draw strength from this diversity and thus, are purposefully committed to providing an accessible workplace where members from every race, national origin, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age and personality profile feel included and valued. We will ensure that all qualified candidates receive full consideration and that for every open role we seek a diverse pool of candidates for consideration prior to selecting the most qualified individual to fill those open roles.
Talent and Career Development. We support and encourage continuous learning, training and career development for all employees. In addition to our general new hire orientation, employees are trained on job-specific requirements, as well as topics such as cybersecurity, data privacy, anti-harassment and anti-bullying.
Employee career development is a key focus in the attraction, retention and management of our human capital resources. Our success planning process allows each employee to discuss career development goals with his or her manager and to provide feedback on broader company processes, to help both the employee and the Company become more successful. Success plans are tracked via the employee portal, which senior management monitors to ensure full participation. 
Community Engagement. We believe in the importance of giving back to the communities where we live and work. Our Community imPACT initiative has two major components. We organize Company-sponsored volunteer opportunities with selected organizations across our geographic locations that focus on combating food insecurity. We also encourage our employees to take action in their own communities by volunteering with charitable organizations of their choice, and we support their efforts by providing up to 16 hours of paid time off each year for individual volunteering.
COVID-19 and Employee Safety. During the COVID-19 pandemic our primary focus has been the health and safety of our employees and their families. We encouraged all employees to transition to remote work, implemented additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work, and restricted travel to essential business-critical needs. We have taken a flexible approach to help our employees manage their work and personal responsibilities. In addition, we have provided our employees with health and wellness resources, such as up-to-date COVID information and counseling resources. Our CEO 

and President has provided COVID-19 updates in all of our monthly all-hands town hall calls, and we believe that these transparent, ongoing communications have been critical to maintaining our productivity during the pandemic. As a result, we have been able to seamlessly transition to primarily virtual work without interruption.
Data Privacy
Regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of data protection and privacy continues to increase worldwide. We have established and continue to maintain policies to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws. We also ensure that third parties processing data on our behalf are contractually obligated to follow or are otherwise compliant with such laws.
We are subject to certain privacy and data protection laws in other countries in which we operate, many of which are stricter than those in the United States. Some countries also have instituted laws requiring in-country data processing and/or storage of data. Most notably, in the European Union (“EU”) and United Kingdom (“UK”), the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and comparable UK law create legal and compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of individuals in those regions, regardless of the geographical location of the company, and impose significant fines for non-compliance. We process a limited amount of personal data (as defined under the GDPR) for our clients and act as a data controller with respect to the personal data of our employees and job applicants, some of whom are located outside the United States. Therefore, our privacy policies comply with the GDPR.
In the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us to offer certain specific data privacy rights to California residents. Other states have adopted or are considering similar requirements that may be more stringent and/or expansive than federal requirements. Our privacy policies are compliant with the CCPA and other existing state laws.
Data Security
Information Security Management. Our Software Security Program is managed by our Manager of Information Security, who reports to the VP of Information Systems. We conduct vendor and internal risk assessments at least annually. Our Security Incident Response Team, consisting of personnel from Legal, Human Resources, Marketing, and IT across our business units, is responsible for implementing our Incident Response Policy and Procedure, which includes processes for detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery, as well as an annual tabletop exercise.
Our employees are regularly trained on appropriate security measures. We provide security awareness training for new hires, and for all employees at least quarterly. We conduct user testing through “phishing” campaigns and require remedial training based on results. Our Manager of Information Security produces a monthly security awareness newsletter and periodic updates on recent malicious information security trends and scams.
The Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 Type II examination demonstrates that an independent accounting and auditing firm has reviewed and examined an organization’s control objectives and activities, and tested those controls to ensure that they are operating effectively. The Company obtains a SOC 2 Type II report annually based on an independent third-party audit. The third party examines the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls to provide reasonable assurance that our service commitments and system requirements were achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria for security, availability, processing integrity and confidentiality.

Client Data Security. We have web application firewalls and data encryption (both in transit and at rest) to ensure that our client data is adequately protected. Our software applications undergo manual code reviews, static code analysis to test for vulnerabilities, and annual third-party penetration testing, with a formal change control process in place to correct any deficiencies. Our SaaS environments are safeguarded by vulnerability management software that detects Operating Systems ("OS") and third-party application vulnerabilities; applies vulnerability patching on a monthly basis; and ensures emergency patching of critical vulnerabilities. Data security is monitored with fully-integrated Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) software, and we provide 24/7 security monitoring and alerting for all SaaS client environments. Only approved users may access our SaaS environments, and such access is further controlled through two-factor authentication and quarterly access reviews.
Data in our cloud-based solutions is hosted in a Microsoft Azure environment. Microsoft provides numerous security measures, including geo-redundant storage (GRS) with cross-regional replication for storage of backup data, and site recovery that replicates virtual machines in real-time to a different Azure region.
Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery. We have a documented Disaster Recovery Procedure and Business Continuity Plan. Key actions and responsibilities are handled by a designated Disaster Recovery Team and Emergency Management Team, respectively. The policies and procedures are reviewed, updated, and approved by executive management annually, and a Business Impact Analysis is performed as part of our Business Continuity Plan.
Sustainability in Data Operations
Hosting. Sustainability is a critical factor when we evaluate potential hosting partners. We continue to expand our partnership with Microsoft, including increases in our Azure footprint for hosting client SaaS environments as well as many internal operations. Microsoft has been carbon neutral since 2012 and is committed to being carbon negative by 2030, with the commitment by 2050 to remove all the carbon it has directly emitted since its founding in 1975. Our primary hosting partner, Microsoft Azure, has committed to focus on four key areas of environmental impact on local communities—carbon, water, waste, and ecosystems:
a.100% renewable energy by 2025
b.Water positive by 2030 (replenish more water than consumed)
c.Zero-waste certification by 2030
d.Net-zero deforestation for all new data centers.
Data Destruction & Sanitation Policy. Third parties perform secure destruction of media and we receive a certificate of secure destruction from such parties. Items for destruction or recycling are processed using an environmentally friendly waste-to-energy incineration process or e-Stewards® certified recycling process so that the information cannot be reconstructed.
