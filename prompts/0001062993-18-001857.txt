Our Current Business
We entered into a license agreement to obtain an exclusive, 40 year, worldwide license to use and commercialize 15 domain names related to the automotive e-commerce business. In consideration for the granting of the license, we will pay to the licensor a royalty of 2.5% of gross sales for any revenue derived from the use of the licensed domains. Consistent with our historical operations in this area, we intend to continue to pursue automotive e-commerce opportunities.
 Our recent business plan has been to launch a retail consumer portal for the sale of auto parts and accessories. However, we are currently reviewing our business strategy with respect to launching a business to consumer website. Major competitors including eBay and Amazon have recently launched major initiatives to sell auto parts and accessories on-line. We are continuing to monitor these developments. In addition, we are also currently reviewing other potential business ventures, in an effort to capitalize on our logistics and distribution expertise. We have not been able to raise, sufficient capital to launch our e-commerce business, particularly given these developments in the industry.
 Other than as set out in this annual report, we have not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, nor have we been a party to any material reclassification, merger, consolidation or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of our business. 
 Competition
 We will encounter active competition in all of our businesses from both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses via e-commerce. We have a large number of competitors; however, aside from a small number of who market a range of products somewhat comparable to us, the majority of our competitors compete only with respect to one or more individual products or product lines in that segment. Certain large customers offer private label brands (house brands) that compete across a wider spectrum of our DIY segment product offerings.
