Item 1. Business.
History
 
We were originally incorporated in the State of Colorado in August 1998 under the name “Network Acquisitions, Inc.” We changed our name to Cavion Technologies, Inc. in February 1999 and subsequently to Concord Ventures, Inc. in October 2006. On December 21, 2000, we filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. In connection with the filing, on February 16, 2001, we sold our entire business, and all of our assets, for the benefit of our creditors. After the sale, we still had liabilities of $8.4 million and were subsequently dismissed by the Court from the Chapter 11 reorganization, effective March 13, 2001, at which time the last of our remaining directors resigned. On March 13, 2001, we had no business or other source of income, no assets, no employees or directors, outstanding liabilities of approximately $8.4 million and had terminated our duty to file reports under securities law. In February 2008, we were re-listed on the OTC Bulletin Board.
 
In April 2010, Concord Ventures, Inc. ("Concord"), a Colorado corporation, incorporated three new subsidiary companies, CCVG, Inc. ("CCVG"), CCAPS Co. ("CCAPS") and Golden Dragon Holding Co. ("Golden Dragon"). All three of the new subsidiary companies were domiciled in Delaware.
 
In order for Concord to re-domicile in Delaware from Colorado, on September 29,2010, Concord entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger ("the Merger Agreement") with its wholly owned subsidiary, CCVG. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Concord shares of common stock converted automatically to CCVG shares, without change or necessity to reissue. Also under the Merger Agreement, CCVG became the surviving company domiciled in Delaware.
 
Effective December 31, 2010, CCVG completed an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization y (the “Reorganization") with CCAPS and Golden Dragon, both becoming wholly-owned subsidiaries of CCVG. The Reorganization provided for the merger of CCVG with and into CCAPS, with CCAPS being the surviving corporation in that merger. Contemporaneously with CCVG's merger with and into CCAPS, the shareholders of CCVG were converted into our shareholders on a one share for one share basis.
 
As a result of this reorganization Golden Dragon became the surviving publicly quoted parent holding company with CCAPS, the surviving corporation of the merger between CCVG and CCAPS, becoming the sole remaining wholly-owned subsidiary of Golden Dragon.
 
On May 9, 2014, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with CannaPharmaRX, Inc., a Colorado corporation (“Canna Colorado”), and David Cutler, a former President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and director of our Company. Under the Share Purchase Agreement, Canna Colorado purchased 1,421,120 restricted shares of our common stock from Mr. Cutler and an additional 9,000,000 restricted common shares directly from us.

On May 15, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Plan of Merger”) pursuant to which Canna Colorado would become a subsidiary of the Company. In October 2014, we changed our legal name to “CannaPharmaRx, Inc.” During the fourth quarter of 2014, in light of the Cohen litigation described in Item 3, below (Legal Proceedings), as well as in the notes to our financial statements included in this report, the parties determined to delay the closing of the transaction contemplated by the original Plan of Merger. After this litigation settled, on April 21, 2015, we entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Canna Colorado and CPHR Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Company (“Acquisition Sub”), pursuant to which Acquisition Sub merged with and into Canna Colorado, with Canna Colorado remaining as the surviving corporation and wholly-owned non-operating subsidiary of our Company and the outstanding shares of Canna Colorado converted into 9,750,000 shares of our common stock (the “Merger”). The Merger Agreement amended and restated in its entirety the Plan of Merger from May 2014.
 
On January 29, 2015, we received a deficiency notice from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), stating that FINRA would not process our name change from October 2014 due to questions about our ownership raised in the Cohen litigation described above. We appealed the notice, arguing among other things that the ownership of our Company was not at issue in the Cohen litigation. On March 20, 2015, FINRA reversed the deficiency notice and subsequently processed ours request to change our name and trading symbol.
 
On June 29, 2015, we closed the Merger Agreement, with 100% of the Canna Colorado shareholders exchanging, on a 1:1 exchange ratio, a total of 9,750,000 Canna Colorado shares in return for a total of 9,750,000 shares of our common stock. Additionally, pursuant to the Merger, all of the shares of our common stock previously owned by Canna Colorado were cancelled. Canna Colorado is now a wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
As a result of the aforesaid transactions, we became an early-stage pharmaceutical company whose purpose was to advance cannabinoid research and discovery using proprietary formulation and drug delivery technology then under development. We also intended to own and operate compounding and specialty pharmacies. We regularly engaged in discussions to acquire such pharmacies and to finance such acquisitions, but to date but have not successfully consummated any such acquisition.
 
We intended to accomplish the following:
 

· | advance cannabinoid discovery. Cannabinoids are a class of chemicals active in the endocannabinoid system.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | advance endocannabinoid science and research and development and to work to bring novel prescription, personal care, and veterinary cannabinoid-based products to market in the U.S. and worldwide.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | focus our operations on endocannabinoid research; product development and packaging; distribution channel development and management; and information technology date and registry.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | serve the marketplace for drug products in the following therapeutic categories: schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, oncology, infectious disease, pain management, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory disease, gastrointestinal disorders and ophthalmology.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | operate our operations in compliance with all applicable federal laws and regulations, including those enforced by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, Department of Agriculture, Food and Drug Administration and Federal Trade Commission.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We did not intend to become a marketing or service company attempting to operate outside of federal marijuana prohibitions.
 
Our then management understood the wide range of efficacies that the cannabis plant possesses, and tried to apply the pharmaceutical research, manufacturing and distribution system that is already in place to provide novel treatments to patients who can benefit from cannabinoid therapies.
 
It was also an aspect of our strategy to acquire, own and operate marijuana grow facilities which were federally licensed to operate in Canada.
 
We have a limited operating history in our proposed business and have never generated operating revenue. We make no representation, and can provide no assurance, that our Company will be able to successfully operate as we intend or to raise the necessary capital required to conduct such operations.

During our fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we attempted to accomplish the following:
 
Research & Development and Commercialization Product Portfolio. We intended to research, develop and potentially commercialize a diverse line of cannabinoid-based products that will meet the needs of healthcare providers serving various human and veterinary patient population needs. Products will be labeled for medical indications, strengths, dosing and safety, as well as route of administration.
Compounding Pharmacies. We intended to acquire multiple licensed pharmacies and pharmacy compounding centers. Each center will compound non-sterile, standardized and labeled products.
 
Patient Acquisition. We believed that patient acquisition will play an important role in the success of our business. We had has relationships with specialty pharmacy providers treating patients with diseases requiring concomitant or mono-cannabinoid therapies.
Cannabinoid Sourcing Platform. Once enough clinical and safety data is amassed and we began to understand consumer needs, we intended to outsource, build, acquire or partner with a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility for product development to further ensure consistency of product quality, as well as to control manufacturing costs due to scalable economies.
 
RECRUIT Registry™ Development and Implementation. We intended to design, develop and implement a longitudinal database metaregistry compendium, branded as the RECRUIT Registry™, for product usage, clinical management and outcomes reporting supported by real-world evidence from data gathering through our monitoring. We completed a software development project for the related registry website in late 2014, but the database never became operational.
 
Post Marketing Surveillance Platform Tools. We intended to design applications to provide healthcare providers with a prescribing and monitoring tool for our patients to track and report the clinical outcomes from their use of cannabinoid products, including the following types of tools:
Physician Portal – Will provide physicians with access to information about common medical conditions, and assist physicians in matching our formulary products to the needs of our patients.
 
Patient Portal – Will allow patients to make product selections based upon disease and available products. Applications designed for hand-held and mobile electronic devices, such as a smart phone or iPad, will allow patients to report and track their therapies, side effects, and dosage adjustments, as well as disease progress and clinical outcomes.
Pharmacist Portal – Will provide pharmacists with access to data allowing them to provide clinical therapy management of patients on cannabinoid therapy.
 
Payer Portal – Will provide payers with access to cost-benefit analyses to assist with access, reimbursement and formulary decision for care delivery, quality and anticipated outcomes.
 
Value Differentiation
 
We intended to provide licensed healthcare providers with a safe environment for their patients to receive cannabinoid-based products, while being able to develop their own compendium and knowledge of real-world clinical evidence. We intended to provide healthcare providers such as physicians and pharmacists with tools to track the results of cannabinoid therapy and document retrospective results. This may allow them to learn and apply intelligence to future prescribing decisions.
Clinical Research and Real World Evidence-based Medicine
 
We intended to provide cannabinoid-based products and monitor patients in controlled studies as well as real-world environments. We also intended to collaborate with the leading scientific and medical researchers working with cannabinoid-based products and patients.

Public Relations
 
We intended to establish our operating subsidiary as the new model in the United States for the safe manufacture and distribution of cannabinoid-based products. With the guiding principle of promoting the best interests of patient safety, we intend to communicate with our peers in the pharmaceutical, legal, scientific and medical communities regarding the best practices to use in approaching the development of cannabinoid-based therapies. Publication dissemination will help make known our mission of bringing novel endocannabinoid therapeutics to underserved patient populations through professional and public media relations.
Background – The Science of Endocannabinoids
 
The recent identification of cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous lipid ligands has triggered an exponential growth of studies exploring the human endocannabinoid system – the largest identified system of receptors in the human body – and its regulatory functions in health and disease. Such studies have been greatly facilitated by the introduction of selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists and inhibitors of endocannabinoid metabolism and transport, as well as mice deficient in cannabinoid receptors or the endocannabinoid-degrading enzyme fatty acid amidohydrolase.
 
In the past decades, the endocannabinoid system has been implicated in a growing number of physiological functions, both in the central and peripheral nervous systems and in peripheral organs. More importantly, modulating the activity of the endocannabinoid system may have therapeutic promise in a wide range of disparate diseases and pathological conditions, ranging from mood and anxiety disorders, movement disorders such as Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases, neuropathic pain, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury, to cancer, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension, glaucoma, obesity/metabolic syndrome, and osteoporosis, among others.
 
An impediment to the development of cannabinoid medications has been the psychoactive properties of plant-derived or synthetic agonists, mediated by CB1 receptors, which are illegal under federal law and the laws of many states and other jurisdictions. However, this problem does not arise when the therapeutic aim is achieved by treatment with a CB1 receptor antagonist, such as in obesity, and may also be absent when the action of endocannabinoids is enhanced indirectly through blocking their metabolism or transport. The use of selective CB2 receptor agonists, which lack psychoactive properties, could represent another promising avenue for certain conditions.
 
The abuse potential of plant-derived cannabinoids may also be limited through the use of preparations with controlled composition and the careful selection of dose and route of administration. We believe that the growing number of preclinical studies and clinical trials with compounds that modulate the endocannabinoid system are likely to result in new and entirely legal novel therapeutic approaches in a number of diseases for which current treatments do not fully address patients’ needs.
 
We intended to further develop as well as leverage our commercial, health system and academic relationships, domestically and worldwide, to further explore and exploit the endocannabinoid system (eCS), and commence extensive discovery, research, and development of cannabinoid molecules, potentially offering not only new insights into the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic actions of plant-derived phytocannabinoids, but also producing molecular targets for pharmacotherapy.
 
Innovative Development of Prescription, Personal Care and Veterinary Products
 
Prescription Brand Medicines: We intended to invest in the due diligence of drug discovery through product registration and approvals by regulatory authorities in the U.S. and abroad. It was our intent that our products be vetted through the accepted, proven and rigorous FDA drug research and development process: Discovery, Pre-clinical, Formulation, Proof-of-Concept, Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, and post-marketing Phases IV and V.
 
There is substantial pre-clinical evidence in the worldwide literature on the effects of cannabinoid substances in animal models. We had already undertaken an in-depth analysis into these data to help determine which compounds may be further studied in additional animal models and to move selected compounds into early clinical evaluation in humans.

By developing collaborative relationships and working together through such collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, research and academic institutions, as well as physicians and researchers, both domestically and worldwide, We intended to develop both single and combination prescription entity products and bring them to market, as well as to develop protocols, apply to institutional review boards, and conduct animal and human Phase I – Phase V clinical trials.
 
We hoped to partner with existing organizations that comply with good manufacturing practices (GMP) guidelines for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products and comply with good clinical practices (GCP) guidelines in the conduct of clinical trials. Our goal is to become the worldwide leader in cannabinoid science and in the research, development and commercialization of cannabinoid-based molecules for prescription and personal care drug candidates.
 
Our purpose is to innovate to bring cannabinoid-based therapies that significantly improve patients’ lives to market. Research and development will be at the heart of our purpose as we work to transform advanced science and technologies into the therapies that matter most.
 
We intended to focus our efforts in core areas where we believed we would be best positioned to bring needed therapies to patients. This includes chronic inflammatory disease, oncology, pain, neurosciences, and metabolic disorders. All are specialty areas in which our executive team has expertise. We bring differentiated capabilities in medicine design and development, and our approach will be to collaborate in new and dynamic ways with other innovators across the health landscape including academic scientists, patient foundations, governments, other biopharmaceutical companies and treating physicians.
 
To execute on our commitment, we attempted to develop an extensive international network of prominent scientists in the cannabinoid field and are also hiring a leadership team with extensive experience in developing plant-based prescription pharmaceutical products.
 
Where advantageous, we planned to enter into license agreements with other pharmaceutical companies. We planned on retaining control over product development and also retaining the manufacturing expertise for our products.
 
Personal Care and Neutraceutical Product Therapies: We intended to establish a cannabinoid sourcing platform that can potentially supply manufacturers with pharmaceutical grade products. We planned to develop strategic relationships and to complete acquisitions that will establish us as a global leader in cannabinoid supply. We understood the need to establish a current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) facility for packaging, testing, and logistics. We sought an opportunity to provide compounding pharmacies with cannabinoid molecules and compounds. We also intended to supply the cannabinoid material needs to neutraceutical and personal care industries.
 
Veterinary products: Current research suggests that many animals have a higher prevalence of endocannabinoid receptors than humans. Given this evidence in animal models, CannaPharmaRx believes cannabinoid therapeutic applications in the veterinary marketplace will be numerous, and development will run parallel to the human prescription program.
 
In order to implement our business plan we needed to raise a significant amount of money, which we were unable to accomplish. See “Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion – Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a discussion of this issue.
 
In October 2015, we ceased active operations due to an insufficiency of funds and an inability to raise further funding. Most of our management resigned their respective positions with our Company in late 2015 and early 2016. See “Part III, Item 10, Management,” below.
 
Employees
 
During 2015, we employed 8 persons, including six executives, one general staff and one administrative person. Additionally, we employed one consultant. 
 
As of the date of this report we have no employees except our current management. See “Part III, Item 10, Management” below.

Competition
 
There are other emerging pharmaceutical companies that are exploring cannabinoid-based molecules. These companies have products at all stages of development, from discovery to Phase 3, and launched commercially. We expected that products that we develop will be competitive in the marketplace with other products serving the same market sectors. Our management believed that our team’s experience in bringing products to market would permit us to achieve success despite the existence of other developmental companies.
 
We believed some of our competitors include:
 

· | GW Pharmaceuticals PLC – A biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product platform in a broad range of disease areas.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Insys Therapeutics, Inc. – A pharmaceutical company with two marketed products, Subsys and Dronabinol SG Capsule, focused on sublingual spray drug delivery technology and dronabinol formulation/manufacturing capabilities, respectively, plus conducting research on other cannabinoid-based products under development.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc. – A pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of next-generation synthetic cannabinoid therapeutics formulated for transdermal delivery for patients with significant medical need.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Nemus Bioscience Inc. – A biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of cannabis-based therapeutics through a partnership with the University of Mississippi for the treatment of a variety of diseases or symptoms.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Easton Pharmaceuticals Inc. – A specialty pharmaceutical company involved in various industries including medical marijuana who also owns, designs, develops, and markets topically-delivered drugs and therapeutic / cosmetic healthcare products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
There are competitors in the cannabinoid pharmaceutical industry with far greater resources, particularly financial and marketing resources, which might compete with us. Such resources could overwhelm our efforts and cause us to not meet its stated objectives.
 
Government Regulation
 
The prospect for cannabinoid-based pharmaceuticals to be approved through the FDA approval pathway has been the subject of statements from the White House, Congress and the DEA. The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy states on its “Answers to the Frequently Asked Questions About Marijuana” on the White House website that the FDA has recognized and approved the medicinal use of isolated components of the “marijuana” plant and related synthetic compounds. In its June 2012 report titled “Reducing the U.S. Demand for Illegal Drugs,” the U.S. Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control expressed the view that the development of “marijuana”-based therapeutics through an approved FDA process is the best route to explore. In its April 2013 report titled “The DEA Position on Marijuana,” the DEA expressed support for ongoing research into potential medicinal uses of marijuana’s active ingredients. Our Company intended to focus only on non-THC, hemp based products, which are exempt from the Canadian Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and the Industrial Hemp Regulations promulgated thereunder (although not under U.S. federal law), so long as the THC component is less than .3% (the legal definition of “hemp,” a cultivar of cannabis).
 
DEA Registration and Inspection of Facilities
 
Facilities conducting research, manufacturing, distributing, importing or exporting, or dispensing controlled substances must be registered to perform these activities and have the security, control, recordkeeping, reporting and inventory mechanisms that comply with DEA regulations to prevent drug loss and diversion. All these facilities must renew their registrations annually, except dispensing facilities, which must renew every three years. The DEA conducts periodic inspections of certain registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Obtaining the necessary registrations from the DEA may result in delays, which could be substantial. Furthermore, failure to maintain compliance with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act, as amended (the “CSA”), particularly non-compliance resulting in loss or diversion, can result in regulatory action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to restrict, suspend or revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings.

State-Controlled Substances Laws
 
Individual states have also established controlled substance laws and regulations. Though these controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may place products on their controlled substances schedules. While some states automatically schedule a drug based on federal action, other states schedule drugs through rulemaking or a legislative action. State scheduling may delay commercial sale of any product for which we obtain federal regulatory approval and adverse scheduling could have a material adverse effect on the commercial marketability of such product. We or our partners must also obtain separate state registrations, permits or licenses in order to be able to obtain, handle, and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions by the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law.
Clinical Trials
 
To conduct clinical trials of a preparation with a controlled substance in the United States prior to approval, research sites must submit a research protocol to the DEA and obtain and maintain a DEA researcher registration that will allow those sites to handle dispense and obtain the product. If the DEA delays or denies the grant of a research registration to one or more research sites, the clinical trial could be significantly delayed, and we could lose clinical trial sites. The importer for the clinical trials must also obtain a Schedule I importer registration and an import permit for each import.
FDA Approval Process
 
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications (“NDAs”), warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 
Pharmaceutical product development in the United States typically involves pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate, well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 
Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of pre-clinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term pre-clinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations, (ii) in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors, and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.

The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board “IRB”, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or may impose other conditions.
 
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the trial is a large multi-center trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with potentially serious outcome, and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all pre-clinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,169,000, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $104,000 per product and $554,000 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually.
 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months, while most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. For biologics, priority review is further limited only for drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease relative to the currently approved products. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, which is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices or cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
The Hatch-Waxman Act
 
Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement, certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use, rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
 
If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 
The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.

Exclusivity
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (“NCE”), which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which time the FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug.
 
Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.
 
For a botanical drug, FDA may determine that the active moiety is one or more of the principle components or the complex mixture as a whole. This determination would affect the utility of any 5-year exclusivity as well as the ability of any potential generic competitor to demonstrate that it is the same drug as the original botanical drug.
 
Patent Term Extension
 After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase — the time between IND submission and NDA submission — and all of the review phase — the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.
 
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the PTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
 
Advertising and Promotion
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet.
 
Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 
Adverse Event Reporting and GMP Compliance
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.

In July 2018, we commenced an offering of up to $2MM of convertible notes.  The notes carry an interest rate of 12% and are convertible into shares of our common stock at the lesser of $0.40 or 50% discount to the market price on the date of conversion.  The term of the notes is for one year and they must be converted upon closing a financing, acquisition or other form of business combination in an amount greater than $5 million.  As of the date of this report we have accepted aggregate subscriptions of $640,000 in this Offering, none of which has been converted. The offering remains open as of the date of this Report.
