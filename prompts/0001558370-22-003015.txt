ITEM 1. BUSINESS
​
We are a gene therapy company focused on developing life-changing treatments and next-generation platform technologies. We focus on diseases where we believe a single dose adeno-associated virus, or AAV, gene therapy approach that either increases or decreases the production of a specific protein can either halt or slow disease progression or reduce symptom severity, therefore providing clinically meaningful impact to patients.  Our gene therapy platforms enable us to engineer, optimize, manufacture and deliver AAV-based gene therapies that we believe have the potential to safely provide durable efficacy. Our team of experts in the field of AAV gene therapy first identifies and selects diseases that are well-suited for treatment using AAV gene therapy. We then engineer and optimize AAV vectors for delivery of the virus payload to the targeted tissue or cells. 

We are identifying proprietary AAV capsids, the outer viral protein shells that enclose genetic material of a virus payload. Our team has developed a proprietary AAV capsid discovery platform called TRACERTM (Tropism Redirection of AAV by Cell Type-Specific Expression of RNA) to facilitate the selection of AAV capsids with blood brain barrier, or BBB, crossing and cell-specific transduction properties for particular therapeutic applications. The TRACER discovery platformis a broadly-applicable, functional RNA-based AAV capsid discovery platform that allows for rapid in vivo evolution of AAV capsids with cell-specific transduction properties in multiple species, including non-human primates. We believe our single dose gene therapies have the potential to be delivered directly, with targeted or systemic surgical delivery or infusions, in conjunction with capsids we discover through our TRACER platform, which we refer to as TRACER capsids.
We are also applying the TRACER discovery platform towards further capsid variant libraries and selection for tropism and transduction in additional cell and tissue types. We are actively engaged in discussions with multiple parties to make TRACER capsids available to third parties for use in their drug development programs through potential licensing and other arrangements. 
Our quality and manufacturing processes employ an established system capable of enabling production of high quality AAV vectors at scale sufficient for clinical trials. In addition to our TRACER discovery platform, we have developed a vectorized antibody platform which we believe will overcome many of the challenges of passive immunization.
Our business strategy focuses on discovering, developing, manufacturing and commercializing our gene therapy programs. As part of this strategy, we have developed core competencies specific to AAV gene therapy development and manufacturing. This business strategy also includes business development activities that may include in-licensing activities or partnering certain programs in specific geographies with collaborators, as we have demonstrated through our ongoing collaboration with Neurocrine, or out-licensing activities including license agreements related to our TRACER capsids such as our October 2021 licensing agreement with Pfizer Inc., which we refer to as Pfizer, and our March 2022 licensing agreement with Novartis Pharma, AG, which we refer to as Novartis. We believe there is an ongoing opportunity for out-licensing transactions related to the TRACER capsids. To maximize the potential of TRACER capsids for both our own programs and out-licensing transactions, we have retained to date, and expect to retain in the future, all rights associated with such TRACER capsids other than the rights specific to their use in combination with a particular licensee’s transgenes. Since our inception, our operations have focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, establishing our intellectual property portfolio, determining which neurological, cardiac, and other diseases to pursue, advancing our product candidates including delivery and manufacturing, and conducting preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. 
We have funded our operations primarily through private placements of redeemable convertible preferred stock, public offerings of our common stock, and our strategic collaborations, including our prior collaboration with Sanofi Genzyme Corporation, or the Sanofi Genzyme Collaboration, which commenced in February 2015 and was terminated in June 2019, our prior collaboration with AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd. focusing on tau-related disease, or the AbbVie Tau Collaboration, which commenced in February 2018 and was terminated in August 2020, our prior collaboration with AbbVie Ireland Unlimited Company focusing on pathological species of alpha-synuclein, or the AbbVie Alpha-




Synuclein Collaboration, which commenced in February 2019 and was terminated in August 2020, our ongoing collaboration with Neurocrine, which commenced in March 2019, our licensing agreement with Pfizer, which commenced in October 2021, and our licensing agreement with Novartis, which commenced in March 2022. We refer to our collaboration agreement with Neurocrine as the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement. We refer to our licensing agreement with Pfizer as the Pfizer License Agreement. We refer to our licensing agreement with Novartis as the Novartis License Agreement.
In August 2021, we initiated a strategic initiative and reevaluated our existing product candidate portfolio. As a result of this reevaluation, we intend to invest additional resources in our TRACER discovery platform, to expand discovery of TRACER capsids with broad tissue tropism in central nervous system, or CNS, cardiac and other tissues. We also plan to advance innovative gene therapy programs that leverage these TRACER capsids as well as our vectorized antibody technology. 
We determined in 2021 that we would not advance our VY-AADC program for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease on our own. Additionally, to take advantage of our TRACER capsid development efforts, we decided in 2021 to discontinue our VY-HTT01 program for the treatment of Huntington’s disease and to initiate a second-generation program for the treatment of Huntington’s disease leveraging a proprietary AAV capsid that may enable intravenous administration and achieve broad distribution to affected tissue. We have also initiated gene therapy programs using our TRACER capsids in treatment programs for monogenic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS; spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA; and various diseases linked to GBA1 mutations, including Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body dementia and Gaucher’s disease. We continue to advance our vectorized antibody platform capability with programs for tauopathies and indications in neuro-oncology. We continue to partner with Neurocrine on programs for diseases including Friedreich’s ataxia. All of our current product candidates are in the early stages of development. We continue to evaluate additional diseases that could be treated using AAV gene therapy and are also actively exploring additional potential treatment methods that can utilize our proprietary TRACER capsids.
Our pipeline of gene therapy programs is summarized in the table below: 





TRACER Capsid Discovery
Our scientists have developed TRACER, a proprietary AAV capsid discovery platform to facilitate the selection of TRACER capsids with BBB crossing and cell-specific transduction properties for particular therapeutic applications. In May 2021, we presented new data demonstrating that we have developed a series of novel AAV capsids which, following intravenous administration, achieve up to 1000-fold higher RNA expression in the brain and 100-fold higher expression in the spinal cord of nonhuman primates than AAV9, the current natural AAV serotype with the best ability to ability to cross the BBB. We also identified a capsid which displayed strong cardiac transduction and significant dorsal root ganglia detargeting in nonhuman primates, which may avoid toxicities associated with AAV9 delivery. We believe these capsids may allow for significantly enhanced gene delivery to specific types of cells in the brain at lower doses. These capsids are now in advanced stages of characterization for deployment in our gene therapy development programs. We are also applying the TRACER discovery platform towards further capsid variant libraries and selection for tropism and transduction in additional cell and tissue types, such as cardiac and other tissues. 
We are actively engaged in discussions with multiple parties to make TRACER capsids available to third parties for use in their drug development programs through potential licensing and other arrangements. We believe there is significant opportunity for out-licensing transactions related to our TRACER capsids. To maximize the potential of our TRACER capsids for both our own programs and out-licensing transactions, we have retained to date, and expect to retain in the future, all rights associated with such TRACER capsids other than the rights specific to their use in combination with the licensee’s transgenes.
Pfizer Option and License Agreement 
On October 1, 2021, we entered into an option and license agreement with Pfizer, which we refer to as the Pfizer License Agreement, pursuant to which we have granted Pfizer options to receive an exclusive license, or the License Options, to certain TRACER capsids to develop and commercialize certain AAV gene therapy candidates comprised of a capsid and specified Pfizer transgenes, which we refer to as the Pfizer Transgenes. Under the terms of the Pfizer License Agreement, Pfizer intends to evaluate the potential use of the capsids in combination with up to two Pfizer Transgenes to help treat respective central nervous system and cardiovascular diseases. 
Under the Pfizer License Agreement, we have agreed to provide Pfizer with certain quantities of materials encoding specified existing capsids for Pfizer’s evaluation. During the research term, which extends until October 1, 2022, or, in the event Pfizer exercises a License Option, until October 1, 2024, we may, at our sole discretion and expense, conduct additional research activities to identify additional proprietary capsids that may be useful for AAV gene therapies for the treatment of central nervous system or cardiovascular diseases. We have agreed to disclose to Pfizer, on a rolling basis, the performance characteristics identified during the research term for all such capsid candidates. Following such disclosure, Pfizer has the right, in its sole discretion, to select any capsid candidate for evaluation to determine its interest in exercising a License Option with respect to such capsid candidate. Pfizer may exercise up to two License Options, provided that it may exercise only one License Option for each Pfizer Transgene. We have granted Pfizer, effective upon Pfizer’s exercise of a License Option, with respect to a capsid candidate for the Pfizer Transgene identified therein, an exclusive, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, under certain of our intellectual property, the rights to develop and commercialize the applicable licensed capsid as incorporated into products containing the corresponding Pfizer Transgene, or the Licensed Products. Additionally, upon such option exercise, we and Pfizer have agreed that we shall provide certain additional know-how that has not been previously provided to Pfizer to enable Pfizer to exploit such licensed capsid and the corresponding Pfizer Transgene for use in a Licensed Product. Pfizer may, during the research term, conduct additional evaluation of capsid candidates and has the right to substitute any other capsid candidate for the capsid it previously elected to license. 
Subject to our obligations to disclose new capsid candidates and certain know-how, we and Pfizer have agreed to conduct our respective research and evaluation activities independently, with communications being managed by two alliance managers comprised of a designee from each of us and Pfizer. 
Under the Pfizer License Agreement, Pfizer is solely responsible for, and has sole decision-making authority with respect to, development and commercialization of the Licensed Products. In the event Pfizer exercises a License

Pfizer is also required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize each Licensed Product in the United States and at least one Major Market Country where Pfizer or its designated affiliates or sublicensees has received regulatory approval for such Licensed Product, subject to certain limitations. 
We have agreed to provide to Pfizer materials encoding the existing capsid candidates for Pfizer’s evaluation. During the research term, if we identify a new capsid candidate through a specified screening campaign that has not been previously identified and disclosed to Pfizer, we have agreed to, at Pfizer’s request, provide plasmids to Pfizer for the production of such new capsid candidates for evaluation as requested by Pfizer. We have also granted Pfizer, effective upon an option exercise and in addition to its exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property described above, a nonexclusive license, on a licensed capsid-by-licensed capsid basis, under certain of our know-how to exploit the applicable licensed capsid as incorporated into Licensed Products containing the corresponding Pfizer Transgene. 
Under the terms of the Pfizer License Agreement, Pfizer agreed to pay us an upfront payment of $30.0 million. We received this upfront payment in October 2021. Pfizer has also agreed to pay us, upon each License Option exercise, a fee of $10.0 million. Following each License Option exercise with respect to a Pfizer Transgene, we are also eligible to receive specified development, regulatory, and commercialization milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $115.0 million for the first corresponding Licensed Product to achieve the corresponding milestone. On a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis, we are also eligible to receive (a) specified sales milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $175.0 million per Licensed Product and (b) tiered, escalating royalties in the mid- to high-single-digit percentages of annual net sales of each Licensed Product. The royalties are subject to potential reductions in customary circumstances including patent claim expiration, payments for certain third-party licenses, and biosimilar market penetration, subject to specified limits. 
Under the terms of the Pfizer License Agreement, each of us and Pfizer owns the entire right, title, and interest in and to all patents or know-how controlled by such party and existing as of or before the effective date of the Pfizer License Agreement, or invented, developed, created, generated or acquired solely by or on behalf of such party after such effective date. 
Subject to certain specified exceptions, any patents and know-how that are invented or otherwise developed jointly by or on behalf of the parties during the term of the Pfizer License Agreement and in the course of our and Pfizer’s activities under the Pfizer License Agreement will follow inventorship under U.S. patent law. Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, we have agreed (i) during the research term, not to conduct any internal program or program on behalf of a third party that is directed to development or commercialization of any capsid candidates, or grant any third party or affiliate any right or license under our rights in such capsid candidates to exploit any therapeutic product, in combination with any Pfizer Transgene in any indication for therapeutic, diagnostic and prophylactic human and veterinary use; and (ii) after Pfizer’s exercise of a License Option, not to grant any third party or affiliate any right or license under our patents to exploit any licensed capsid in combination with any Pfizer Transgene. 
Unless earlier terminated, the Pfizer License Agreement expires on the earlier to occur of (i) the first anniversary of the effective date of the Pfizer License Agreement, if no License Option is exercised, and (ii) the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term with respect to all Licensed Products in all countries if at least one License Option is exercised. Subject to a cure period, either party may terminate the Pfizer License Agreement, in whole or in part, subject to specified conditions, in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. Pfizer may also terminate the Pfizer License Agreement, in whole or in part, subject to specified conditions, for our insolvency, the occurrence of a violation of global trade control laws, or for our noncompliance with certain anti-bribery or anti-corruption covenants. Pfizer may also terminate the Pfizer License Agreement, in whole or in part, for any or no reason upon ninety days’ written notice to us. 
Upon certain terminations for cause by Pfizer, the licenses that we have granted to Pfizer under the Pfizer License Agreement shall become irrevocable and perpetual, and all milestone payments and royalties that would have 




otherwise been payable by Pfizer under such licenses had the Pfizer License Agreement remained in effect would be substantially reduced. 
Novartis Option and License Agreement
On March 4, 2022, or the Novartis Effective Date, we entered into an option and license agreement with Novartis, or the Novartis License Agreement. Pursuant to the Novartis License Agreement, we have granted Novartis options, which we refer to as the Novartis License Options, to license novel capsids generated from our TRACER™ discovery platform, or Novartis Licensed Capsids, for exclusive use with certain targets to develop and commercialize adeno-associated virus gene therapy candidates comprised of Novartis Licensed Capsids and payloads directed to such targets, or the Novartis Payloads. 
During the period, which we refer to as the Novartis Research Term, commencing on the Novartis Effective Date and ending on the first anniversary thereof or, in the event Novartis exercises a Novartis License Option, the third anniversary thereof, we have granted Novartis a non-exclusive research license to evaluate our TRACER capsids for potential use, in combination with Novartis Payloads, in programs targeting three specified genes, which we refer to as the Initial Novartis Targets. Upon the payment of additional fees, Novartis may also assess our TRACER capsids for use with two other targets, which we refer to as Additional Novartis Targets, subject to certain conditions including that such target is not part of, or reasonably competitive with, our current development programs. We refer to the Initial Novartis Targets and the Additional Novartis Targets, collectively, as the Novartis Targets. During the Novartis Research Term, we may, at our sole discretion and expense, conduct further research activities to identify additional TRACER capsids. If we elect to do so, we have agreed to disclose performance characteristics of such new TRACER capsids to Novartis on a rolling basis.
During the Novartis Research Term, Novartis may exercise up to three Novartis License Options—or up to five Novartis License Options if Novartis is evaluating the Additional Novartis Targets—in the aggregate, provided that Novartis may only exercise one Novartis License Option for each Novartis Target. Upon the exercise of any Novartis License Option, we have agreed to grant Novartis a target-exclusive, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, under certain of our intellectual property, the rights to develop and commercialize the applicable Novartis Licensed Capsid as incorporated into products containing the corresponding Novartis Payload, or the Novartis Licensed Products. Upon the exercise of a Novartis License Option, we have agreed to provide certain additional know-how to enable Novartis to exploit the Novartis Licensed Capsid and the corresponding Novartis Payload for use in a Novartis Licensed Product. Novartis may, during the Novartis Research Term but following the exercise of a Novartis License Option, conduct additional evaluation of our capsid candidates and has the right to substitute any other TRACER capsid for a Novartis Licensed Capsid.
Subject to our disclosure obligations described above, we and Novartis have agreed to conduct our respective research and evaluation activities independently, with communications being managed by two alliance managers comprised of a designee from each of us and Novartis.
Under the Novartis License Agreement, Novartis is solely responsible for, and has sole decision-making authority with respect to, development and commercialization of the Novartis Licensed Products.

Upon certain terminations for cause by Novartis, the licenses granted by us to Novartis under the Novartis License Agreement shall become irrevocable and perpetual, and all milestone payments and royalties that would have otherwise been payable by Novartis under such licenses had the Novartis License Agreement remained in effect would be substantially reduced.
Neurocrine Collaboration
In January 2019, we entered into the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement for the research, development and commercialization of four programs including the VY-AADC Program, a gene therapy for the treatment of Friedreich’s ataxia, or the FA Program, and other undisclosed programs, or the Discovery Programs. The Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement became effective in March 2019. Under the terms of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $115.0 million and may receive future development and regulatory milestone payments and royalties. In connection with the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, Neurocrine also paid us $50.0 million as consideration for an equity purchase of 4,179,728 shares of our common stock. In June 2019, in conjunction with the termination of the Sanofi Genzyme Collaboration Agreement that we entered into with Genzyme Corporation in 



February 2015, we transferred ex-U.S. rights to the FA Program to Neurocrine pursuant to an amendment to the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement and received a $5.0 million payment from Neurocrine. Neurocrine is responsible for all costs incurred by us in conducting development activities for programs under the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, in accordance with an agreed budget.
Under the terms of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement for the VY-AADC Program, Neurocrine agreed to fund the clinical development of the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial for VY-AADC (NBIb-1817). After the data readout of the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 trial, we would have had the option to either: (i) co-commercialize VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) with Neurocrine in the United States under a 50/50 cost- and profit-sharing arrangement and receive milestones and royalties based on ex-U.S. sales, or (ii) grant Neurocrine full global commercial rights in exchange for milestone payments and royalties based on global sales. We were eligible to receive aggregate development milestone payments under the VY-AADC Program of up to $170.0 million. We were also eligible to receive royalties, based on future net sales of the collaboration product for the VY-AADC Program in and outside the United States as applicable, at a rate of mid-teens to thirty and low-teens to twenty, respectively.
On February 2, 2021, Neurocrine notified us that it has elected to terminate the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement solely with regards to the VY-AADC Program, effective August 2, 2021, or the Neurocrine VY-AADC Program Termination Effective Date. The Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement remains in full force and effect for each other program thereunder. As a result of the termination, as of the Neurocrine VY-AADC Program Termination Effective Date, the license granted by us to Neurocrine under the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement for the VY-AADC Program expired and we regained worldwide intellectual property rights regarding the VY-AADC Program. Subsequent to the VY-AADC Program Termination Effective Date, Neurocrine no longer reimburses us for research and development activities related to the VY-AADC Program.
Under the FA Program, we and Neurocrine are developing a gene therapy for the treatment of Friedreich’s ataxia, a debilitating neurodegenerative disease resulting in poor coordination of legs and arms, progressive loss of the ability to walk, generalized weakness, loss of sensation, scoliosis, diabetes and cardiomyopathy as well as impaired vision, hearing, and speech. We and Neurocrine are evaluating potential development candidates that will comprise a capsid, promoter, and FXN transgene. If we and Neurocrine successfully identify a lead candidate and an AAV capsid for this program and reach agreement on a product profile and product development program, we plan to complete IND enabling studies to evaluate its safety and efficacy.
In addition to the upfront payment, we are eligible to receive aggregate development milestone payments under the FA Program of up to $195.0 million, and under each of the Discovery Programs of up to $130.0 million per program. We may also be entitled to receive aggregate commercial milestone payments for each collaboration product of up to $275.0 million, subject to an aggregate cap on commercial milestone payments across all programs of $1.1 billion. We are also eligible to receive royalties, based on future net sales of the collaboration products. Such royalty percentages, for net sales in and outside the United States, as applicable, range (i) for the FA Program, from the low-teens to high-teens and high-single digits to mid-teens, respectively; and (ii) for each Discovery Program, from the high-single digits to mid-teens and mid-single digits to low-teens, respectively.
AbbVie Collaborations
In 2018, we began collaborating with AbbVie on the research and development of specified vectorized antibody compounds comprised of an AAV or other viral capsid and a virus vector genome that encodes one or more antibodies that target and bind to a tau protein, which we refer to as the AbbVie Tau Collaboration. Separately, in 2019, we began collaborating with AbbVie on the research and development of specified vectorized antibody compounds comprised of an AAV or other viral capsid and a virus vector genome that encodes one or more antibodies and development against pathological species of alpha-synuclein for the potential treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other synucleinopathies which we refer to as the AbbVie Alpha-Synuclein Collaboration. Our vectorized antibody approach aimed to deliver, with a potential one-time intravenous, or IV, administration, the genes that encode for the production of therapeutic antibodies utilizing our proprietary BBB-penetrant AAV capsids. This approach could potentially result in higher levels of therapeutic antibodies in the brain compared with current systemic administration of antibodies. 




Both of our collaborations with AbbVie were terminated by AbbVie, effective as of August 3, 2020, or the AbbVie Collaboration Termination Date. As a result of such terminations, we were relieved of future research and development obligations under each collaboration. We are not obligated to repay the upfront payment we received from AbbVie in connection with entering into either collaboration agreement, but we are no longer eligible to receive option payments, milestone payments or royalties thereunder. 
We expect to continue to advance our research and development efforts related to vectorized antibodies, including vectorized antibody compounds comprised of an AAV or other viral capsid and a virus vector genome that encodes one or more antibodies that target and bind to a tau protein, and we are currently evaluating our options for advancing these efforts individually or with other potential collaborators. We are evaluating our options for potentially advancing our alpha-synuclein program in the future.
Mission and Strategy 
Our mission is to develop and deliver life-changing gene therapies to people around the world. Our strategy to achieve this mission is to: 

● | Continuously invest in our AAV gene therapy platform. We plan to continuously invest in our gene therapy platform to maintain our strong position in the development of next-generation AAV gene therapies for neurological disorders and other serious diseases. Specifically, we intend to further develop and enhance our gene therapy platform by focusing on vector engineering and optimization and dosing and delivery techniques. We plan to continue generating proprietary AAV vectors by engineering and optimizing vectors best suited to targeted tissue types and diseases or conditions. Leveraging our TRACER discovery platform and TRACER capsids, we believe that our gene therapy platform will have the ability to treat certain neurological and other diseases through systemic delivery of our AAV gene therapies. We expect to utilize established and novel techniques for dosing and delivery of our AAV gene therapies to improve transduction efficiency and immune response.

● | Partner and collaborate to maximize the opportunities for our pipeline of gene therapy programs focused on severe neurological diseases and other serious diseases. We believe that our experience in AAV gene therapy for severe neurological diseases, our pipeline of gene therapies, and our gene therapy platform provide us with the opportunity to collaborate to maximize long-term value. As such, we plan to pursue partnerships and licensing opportunities for select pipeline programs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Partner with gene therapy developers to make available AAV capsids identified by our TRACER system. We intend to make available to multiple parties pursuing gene therapy development programs in the CNS and other disease areas capsids identified by our TRACER system that may benefit such development activities given the enhanced performance characteristics of these proprietary capsids. We expect to make these capsids available through potential licensing agreements and other arrangements. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Establish a leadership position in high quality AAV manufacturing. We believe that manufacturing capacity and expertise are critical to successfully treating patients using gene therapy. We have built an onsite, state-of-the-art process research and development facility to enable the manufacturing of high quality AAV gene therapy vectors at research scale. We have previously established relationships with multiple current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, contract manufacturers for clinical scale manufacturing activities and expect to do so again in the future as necessary to support our research and

development programs. We utilize a baculovirus/sf9 production platform that has been developed and continues to be optimized by current and former members of our production team.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Retain commercialization rights to select pipeline programs. We hold worldwide rights to our programs for Huntington’s disease, SOD1 ALS, SMA, various diseases linked to GBA1 mutations, including Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body dementia and Gaucher’s disease, tauopathies, and indications in neuro-oncology. We have retained co-development and co-commercialization rights for the FA Program under our Neurocrine Collaboration, recovered worldwide rights for the VY-AADC Program as of the Neurocrine VY-AADC Program Termination Effective Date, and maintain commercialization rights for our two Discovery Programs under the Neurocrine Collaboration. As we pursue and obtain marketing approval for these and other programs, we expect to build our own sales and marketing infrastructure. for select programs and leverage our partnerships to support our programs where we have retained commercialization rights. Collaborations represent an important advance in our strategy to leverage our AAV gene therapy platform and programs through collaborative partnerships with biopharmaceutical companies that bring complementary expertise, capabilities, and experience, in addition to capital. We will consider future collaborations or licensing arrangements for programs where potential partners have expertise, capabilities or experience that would improve the probability of success or commercial opportunity for the program.

AAV Gene Therapy
Gene therapy is an approach whereby gene expression is directly altered in patients to address the underlying cause or predominant manifestations of disease. We believe that the targeted nature of gene therapy may enable powerful treatment options and provide these patients with meaningful and durable benefits. 



While AAV gene therapy can potentially be harnessed for multiple treatment methods, we are currently focused on gene replacement, gene knockdown and vectorized antibody approaches. Gene replacement is intended to restore the expression of a protein that is not expressed, expressed at abnormally low levels or functionally mutated with loss of function. Gene knockdown, or gene silencing, is intended to reduce the expression of a pathologically mutated RNA or protein that has detrimental effects. Vectorizing an antibody for delivery using AAV has the ability to increase exposure of large antibodies in brain parenchyma that otherwise cannot cross the BBB in any meaningful way when administered passively. 
Our gene therapy approach uses AAV vectors which we believe are ideal vectors for gene therapy for several reasons: 
Broad Applicability. AAV is able to transduce, or transfer a therapeutic gene, into numerous cell types including target cells in the CNS, cardiac, and other tissues.
Safety. We believe AAV is safe and is not known to cause any disease in humans. 
Does Not Readily Integrate. AAV does not readily integrate into the genome of the target cell, reducing the potential for oncogenesis, or the induction of cancer.
Scalability. AAV is able to be manufactured at commercial quality and scale. 
We believe that neurological, cardiac, and other diseases are well-suited for treatment with AAV gene therapy for the following reasons: 
Validated Targets. Many neurological, cardiac, and other diseases are caused by well-defined mutations in genes and these genes represent genetically validated drug targets for AAV gene therapy. 




Targeted Delivery. We believe our TRACER capsids may allow for significantly enhanced gene therapy delivery to specific types of cells and tissues at lower doses. 
Durable Expression. Long-term gene expression may be achievable in the CNS and other tissues following one-time dosing and transfer of the therapeutic gene with an AAV vector. Repeated or continual dosing with direct injection of drugs into the CNS and other tissues is complex, therefore a one-time AAV gene therapy has significant advantages. 
We are currently focused on gene replacement, gene knockdown, and vectorized antibody approaches, and we are also actively exploring additional potential treatment methods such as gene editing to correct or delete a gene in the cell genome. 
The Voyager Gene Therapy Platform
We have built a gene therapy platform that we believe positions us to be the leading company at the intersection of AAV gene therapy and neurological, cardiac, and other diseases. Our team of experts in the field of AAV gene therapy first identifies and selects diseases that are well-suited for treatment using AAV gene therapy. We then engineer and optimize AAV vectors, identifying a capsid for delivery of a payload, comprising a therapeutic gene or transgene, and a promoter to drive expression of the transgene, to the targeted tissue or cells. Finally, we leverage established routes of administration and advances in dosing techniques to optimize delivery of our AAV vectors to target cells that are critical to the disease of interest. We believe that optimizing each of these parameters is a key factor for overall program success. We expect that our current and future pipeline programs will make use of technological advances generated with our gene therapy platform. 
Disease Selection 
We assess potential product programs based upon the following criteria: 
Unmet Need. There is a significant unmet medical need for the indication and substantial commercial potential. 
Target Validation. There is strong evidence that expression of a specific gene or protein, or lack thereof, is causing, or critical to, the disease state. 
Delivery Using AAV. There is strong evidence supporting the ability to target the relevant tissues and cells using an AAV vector to achieve sufficient target gene expression. 
Clinical Readouts. The clinical impact of an AAV gene therapy can be clearly measured, including through well-accepted clinical endpoints and the use of both existing and novel biomarkers. 
Scalability of Manufacturing. Sufficient AAV vector to supply late-stage clinical development and commercialization can be manufactured. 
In addition to the criteria above, we also look for groups of diseases where we can apply our knowledge across multiple diseases or conditions. 
Vector Engineering and Optimization
We have advanced or intend to advance our multiple preclinical programs towards selection of lead clinical candidates using AAV vectors that we believe are best suited for each of our programs either through use of our existing capsids, through exercising a non-exclusive worldwide commercial license to capsid sequences covered by third parties, or by engineering or optimizing TRACER capsids. The key components of an AAV vector include: (i) the capsid; (ii) the therapeutic gene, or transgene; and (iii) the promoter, or the DNA sequence that drives the expression of the transgene. 
Members of our team have co-discovered many of the known naturally occurring AAV capsids and have also created promising genetically engineered AAV capsids. Genetically engineered capsids have yielded vectors with 




desirable properties, such as higher biological potency and enhanced tissue specificity. We believe that there is an opportunity to further optimize AAV capsids to confer desired characteristics relating to properties such as tissue specificity and immunogenicity. We have a significant effort dedicated to the design and selection of proprietary AAV capsids using a number of different scientific approaches. We believe that the information generated by this work will enhance our ability to rationally design AAV capsids with specific properties for particular therapeutic applications. For example, we have identified several proprietary capsids that demonstrate significantly higher BBB penetrance than naturally occurring AAV capsids in preclinical experiments conducted to date, and we are evaluating the possibility of leveraging these TRACER capsids in current and potential programs. 
In early 2019, we presented on our discovery and development of AAV capsids that cross the BBB, after IV administration with improved transduction of the brain and spinal cord and enhanced cellular specificity using libraries under the control of either the neuron-specific synapsin, or SYN, promoter or the astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein, or GFAP, promoter to apply selective pressure for capsid variants that transduce the cell type of interest. As part of that effort, our scientists have developed the TRACER discovery platform to facilitate the selection of AAV capsids with BBB crossing and cell-specific transduction properties for particular therapeutic applications. The TRACER discovery platform is a broadly-applicable, functional RNA-based AAV capsid discovery platform that allows for rapid in vivo evolution of AAV capsids with cell-specific transduction properties in mouse and non-human primate models. Multiple capsid variants have been identified with significant improvement of CNS transduction and BBB-penetrant properties over AAV9 in both mouse and non-human primate models following IV administration after three rounds of selection. These capsids are now in advanced stages of characterization for deployment in our gene therapy development programs. We are also applying the TRACER discovery platform towards further capsid variant libraries and selection for tropism and transduction in additional cell and tissue types. 
With respect to the target DNA delivered through AAV gene therapy, we are designing transgenes selectively for our specific gene therapy programs to provide optimal expression once delivered to the targeted cells and selecting promoters to drive expression of the transgene. 
Manufacturing at Commercial Quality and Scale 
The ability to produce high quality AAV vectors at commercial-scale is a critical success factor in AAV gene therapy. We utilize a baculovirus/sf9 production platform that has been developed and continues to be optimized by current and former members of our production team. This system has a number of attributes that we believe will enable high quality commercial-scale manufacturing, including: 
High Yield. A single manufacturing run at 500-liter scale can yield many thousands of doses of an AAV gene therapy. 
High Purity. A relatively high percentage of AAV vectors contain the therapeutic DNA, reducing the number of empty capsids compared to alternative manufacturing approaches. In addition, the baculovirus/Sf9 system eliminates the risk of introducing mammalian cell derived impurities. 
Scalability. This process has been reproduced at volumes ranging from 0.02 liters to 250 liters. We believe the existing process is scalable to substantially higher volumes. 
We have built a state-of-the-art process research and development production facility for manufacturing research-grade AAV vectors onsite at our Lexington, Massachusetts location. We have previously established contract manufacturing relationships with multiple companies specializing in the manufacture of gene therapy and AAV vectors for clinical scale manufacturing activities and expect to do so again in the future as necessary to support our research and development programs. 
Optimized Delivery and Route of Administration
Identifying the optimal route of administration and delivery parameters for AAV gene therapy, such as infusion volume, flow rate, vector concentration and dose and formulation for a specific disease, are critical to achieving safe and 




effective levels of transgene expression in the targeted tissues. We aim to develop clinically feasible protocols that yield reproducible results across patients.
Overview of Our Pipeline
We have leveraged our gene therapy platform to assemble a pipeline of proprietary AAV gene therapies for the treatment of neurological, cardiac, and other diseases with high unmet medical need. Depending on the disease, our current AAV gene therapies will use a gene replacement, gene knockdown, or vectorized antibody approach. Our goal is to address the underlying cause or the predominant manifestations of a specific disease by significantly increasing or decreasing expression of the relevant proteins in targeted tissues. 


ALS Program: VY-SOD102
Disease Overview 
ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that leads to muscle atrophy, spasticity and weakness as well as impaired speech, swallowing and breathing, with many patients requiring ventilator support as the disease progresses. The average age of onset of ALS is 55 years, and median survival is approximately three years after initial symptoms appear. It is estimated that there are approximately 20,000 patients in the United States who are living with the disease. Familial, or inherited, ALS accounts for approximately 10% of ALS cases, and an estimated 20% of familial ALS is caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1, or SOD1, gene. Therefore, there are an estimated 400-800 patients in the United States with ALS caused by mutations in the SOD1 gene. 
The normal function of the SOD1 protein is to catalyze the conversion of superoxide anion (O2-) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and oxygen (O2). Mutations in SOD1 have been shown to lead to the formation of toxic aggregates of the SOD1 protein, resulting in the dysfunction and death of motor neurons. Patients with familial ALS caused by certain mutations in the SOD1 gene progress more rapidly than patients with other forms of ALS, although the reason for this more rapid progression is unknown. 
There are currently only two FDA-approved treatments for ALS, Riluzole by Sanofi, which has been shown to have only modest efficacy, prolonging life by a few months, and Edaravone, which has been shown to slow decline of daily functioning. 
Our Treatment Approach 
We believe that AAV gene therapy is an attractive approach to treating monogenic ALS caused by SOD1 mutations. Since the SOD1 gene mutations that cause ALS are toxic gain-of-function mutations, we believe that we can employ an AAV gene therapy approach that targets the knockdown of SOD1 gene expression. In addition, the primary target cells - motor neurons - reside within the spinal cord, which we believe can be effectively transduced with AAV gene therapy through intravenous administration. We are seeking to design a product candidate that knocks down SOD1 expression in motor neurons, thereby potentially reducing the level of toxicity associated with mutated protein, and slowing functional decline and prolonging ventilator-independent survival. 
We believe that there is also the potential to leverage our approach for the treatment of other genetically defined forms of ALS. 
Preclinical Studies Targeting SOD1 for Monogenic ALS 
Results from our preclinical studies using intraparenchymal delivery of AAV vector to the spinal cord support targeting mutant SOD1 for the treatment of monogenic ALS. In the mini-pig, used as an animal model as it has a spinal cord similar in size to the human spinal cord, significant knockdown of SOD1 expression was observed following intraparenchymal spinal cord injection of an AAV vector carrying a transgene designed to inhibit SOD1 expression. This 




novel delivery approach with VY-SOD102 reduced SOD1 mRNA in the spinal cord on average by 70% and 50% in the cervical and thoracic regions, respectively, both regions critical for respiratory function, and 82% near the site of cervical injection. In addition, VY-SOD102 reduced SOD1 mRNA by 22% in the lumbar region. 


The knockdown of SOD1 has also been reported to provide significant survival benefits in animal models of ALS. As shown in the example below, mice with a SOD1 mutation treated with an AAV vector to knock down expression of the mutant human SOD1 gene extended median survival by 87 days compared to mice treated with a control vector. 
Improved Survival Post Knockdown of SOD1(1)

These studies provide proof-of-principle for our approach to treating monogenic ALS due to SOD1 mutations with VY-SOD102. 



Our Program Status 
In late 2016, we identified VY-SOD101 as a lead clinical candidate after screening a series of capsids, microRNA expression cassettes, (a segment of DNA that contains the sequence that targets SOD1 gene expression selectively for knockdown), and encoded payloads. We screened more than 100 RNAi sequences, each represented by a bar in the graph below, and successfully identified multiple, highly-potent RNAi sequences targeting SOD1, as highlighted by the yellow bars in the figure below: 
Overview of miRNA Target Sequences for Knockdown of SOD1
The most potent RNAi sequences targeting SOD1 gene expression were evaluated in multiple microRNA expression cassettes and with a number of vector genome configurations. We completed the necessary experiments to evaluate these potential lead candidates based upon criteria that include safety, selectivity, potency, and efficiency and precision of microRNA processing. 
In late 2017, we initiated additional preclinical studies to further optimize our ALS program’s therapeutic approach, including exploration of additional routes of administration and proprietary AAV capsids in large animal models. Based on these studies, we selected VY-SOD102 as our lead candidate. VY-SOD102 was composed of an AAV capsid and a proprietary transgene that harnesses the RNA interference pathway to selectively knock down levels of SOD1 mRNA. We believed that VY-SOD102 had the potential to durably reduce the levels of toxic mutant SOD1 protein in the spinal cord to slow the progression of disease. In late 2018 and early 2019, we presented data on VY-SOD102 administered with a novel delivery paradigm comprising a one-time infusion after laminectomy to the cervical region of the spinal cord. Preclinical data previously reported included significant reductions of SOD1 mRNA throughout the spinal cord of the Göttingen mini-pig, which has a spinal cord similar in length and diameter to the human spinal cord. This novel delivery approach with VY-SOD102 yielded well-tolerated and significant reduction of SOD1 mRNA throughout the spinal cord at four weeks post-dosing. In June 2019 in connection with the restructuring of our gene therapy relationship with Sanofi Genzyme, we decided to reallocate resources to our Huntington’s disease program for VY-HTT01 and new discovery efforts. We expected to seek a partner to advance our preclinical program for SOD1 prior to filing an IND application for advancing VY-SOD102 into clinical development. 
In August 2021, we discontinued our surgically-based preclinical program for SOD1 and initiated a second-generation program for SOD1 leveraging our proprietary TRACER capsids, which we believe will enable intravenous administration. We expect to leverage our experience and certain developments from the discontinued preclinical program for SOD1 to inform our second-generation program for SOD1. We have begun to advance our second-generation program for SOD1 as a wholly-owned program. 



Tau Program
Disease Overview
In healthy individuals, tau is an abundant soluble cytoplasmic protein that binds to microtubules, which are key structural proteins in cells, to promote their stability and function. In Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies, tau aggregates and forms insoluble tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. The progressive spread of tau pathology along distinct anatomical pathways in the brain closely correlates with disease progression and severity in a number of tauopathies, including Alzheimer’s disease, FTD, and PSP. In addition, mutations in the tau gene have been shown to cause inherited forms of tauopathies, including FTD and PSP. Because the extent of tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies closely correlates with the severity of neurodegeneration, synapse loss, and cognitive deficits, attempts to prevent, reduce, or slow the development of tau pathology have become important therapeutic strategies for these diseases.
In previous preclinical studies in animal models, despite high weekly or biweekly systemic doses of anti-tau monoclonal antibodies administered over three to six months, only very low levels of antibody reached the brain, resulting in a modest reduction of tau pathology by approximately 40­ to 50%. This incomplete and modest reduction in tau pathology following treatment with very high and frequent systemic doses of these antibodies may pose therapeutic challenges in humans with various tauopathies. To address these limitations, our tau program attempts to develop AAV gene therapies to deliver monoclonal antibodies to the brain directed against tau as potential new treatments for Alzheimer’s disease and other tau-related neurodegenerative diseases.
Our Program Status
The Tau program is currently in the preclinical stage. In February 2018, we entered into the AbbVie Tau Collaboration Agreement, for the research, development, and commercialization of AAV gene therapy products for the treatment of diseases of the central nervous system and other neurodegenerative diseases related to defective or excess aggregation of tau protein in the human brain, including Alzheimer’s disease. The AbbVie Tau Collaboration Agreement was terminated in its entirety in August 2020. In connection with the termination, we were obligated to undertake certain transition activities, including transferring to AbbVie certain data and reports generated under, and any regulatory filing relating to certain compounds and product candidates investigated in the collaboration. All such activities were completed on or prior to September 30, 2020. As a result of the termination, we have been relieved of future research and development obligations under the collaboration. Exclusivity provisions restricting either party or any of its respective affiliates from directly or indirectly exploiting any vectorized antibody compound targeting a tau protein and restricting us, alone or jointly with any third party, from directly or indirectly exploiting specified antibodies targeting a tau protein were also terminated. Each party retains a royalty-free, exclusive license to the other’s interest in the Joint IP to exploit antibodies it contributed to the collaboration as well as a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to the Joint IP for any other purpose. Further, AbbVie has granted us, effective as of the AbbVie Collaboration Termination Date, a worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable (though multiple tiers), exclusive license to AbbVie’s interest in Joint IP to exploit research compounds or product candidates that were investigated under the collaboration and do not encode antibodies contributed by AbbVie or include active pharmaceutical ingredients owned by AbbVie or its affiliates, for all human diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic uses. We are not obligated to repay the upfront payment it received from AbbVie in connection with entering into the AbbVie Tau Collaboration Agreement but are no longer eligible to receive option payments, milestone payments or royalties thereunder.
Following the termination, we have continued to advance the research and development efforts related to vectorized antibodies, including vectorized antibody compounds comprised of an AAV or other virus vector genome that encodes one of more antibodies that target and bind to a tau protein. We are currently evaluating our options for advancing these efforts individually or with other potential collaborators.



Huntington’s Program
Disease Overview 
Huntington’s disease is a fatal, inherited neurodegenerative disease that results in the progressive decline of motor and cognitive functions and a range of behavioral and psychiatric disturbances. The average age of onset is 39 years, with patients typically dying approximately 15 to 20 years following diagnosis. According to the Huntington’s Disease Society of America, Huntington’s disease affects approximately 30,000 patients in the United States. Huntington’s disease is caused by mutations in the huntingtin, or HTT, gene. Huntington’s disease is an autosomal dominant disorder, which means that an individual is at risk of inheriting the disease if only one parent is affected. More than 200,000 individuals in the United States are at risk for inheriting the mutant gene from an affected parent. While the exact function of the HTT gene in healthy individuals is unknown, it is essential for normal development before birth and mutations in the HTT gene ultimately lead to the production of abnormal intracellular huntingtin protein aggregates that cause neuronal cell death. Currently, there are no approved treatments targeting the underlying cause of the disease and only one drug, tetrabenazine, has been approved for the treatment of the specific motor symptoms of Huntington’s disease. 
Our Treatment Approach 
We believe that AAV gene therapy is an attractive approach to treating Huntington’s disease. Since HTT gene mutations that cause Huntington’s disease are toxic gain-of-function mutations, we believe that we can employ an AAV gene therapy approach designed to knock down expression of the HTT gene. In addition, the targeted cells for treatment primarily reside in discrete regions of the brain - the striatum and the cortex - that can be targeted with AAV gene therapy delivered directly into the brain. The mechanism of action of VY-HTT01 is knockdown of HTT gene expression in neurons in the striatum and cortex, thereby reducing the level of toxicity associated with mutated protein in these brain regions, and slowing the progression of cognitive and motor symptoms. 
Program Status 
As part of our portfolio reevaluation and to leverage more effectively recent developments in our TRACER capsid development efforts, we decided in August 2021 to discontinue our development of VY-HTT01 for the treatment of Huntington’s disease. Accordingly, we did not to initiate our planned Phase 1/2 trial of VY-HTT01, which we referred to as VYTAL, and we withdrew the applicable IND. We have initiated a second-generation program for the treatment of Huntington’s disease using a novel, proprietary AAV capsid that may enable intravenous administration and broader distribution to affected tissue. Although we expect to leverage our experience from our development efforts of VY-HTT01 to inform our approach to our second-generation program for the treatment of Huntington’s disease, we do not expect the preclinical studies we have conducted for VY-HTT01 to be directly relevant to a development candidate for the second-generation program.
Other Preclinical Programs 
We are evaluating additional neurological, cardiac, and other diseases that could be treated using AAV gene therapy through application of either a gene replacement or a gene knockdown approach and are also actively exploring additional potential treatment methods that can utilize an AAV vector. We expect to leverage our proprietary gene therapy platform technologies, including TRACER capsids and our vectorized antibody platform, for any such programs. Our other current discovery programs include treatment programs for SMA and various diseases linked to GBA1 mutations, including Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body dementia and Gaucher’s disease, which leverage our TRACER capsids, and indications in neuro-oncology, which leverage our vectorized antibody program.


Friedreich’s Ataxia Program: VY-FXN01
Disease Overview 
Friedreich’s ataxia is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease resulting in poor coordination of legs and arms, progressive loss of the ability to walk, generalized weakness, loss of sensation, scoliosis, diabetes and cardiomyopathy as well as impaired vision, hearing and speech. The typical age of onset is 10 to 12 years, and life expectancy is severely reduced with patients generally dying of neurological and cardiac complications between the ages of 35 and 45. According to the Friedreich’s Ataxia Research Alliance, there are approximately 6,400 patients living with the disease in the United States. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for the disease. 
Friedreich’s ataxia patients have mutations of the FXN gene that reduce production of the frataxin protein, resulting in the degeneration of sensory pathways and a variety of debilitating symptoms. Friedreich’s ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that a person must obtain a defective copy of the FXN gene from both parents in order to develop the condition. One healthy copy of the FXN gene, or 50% of normal frataxin protein levels, is sufficient to prevent the disease phenotype. We therefore believe that restoring FXN protein levels to at least 50% of normal levels by AAV gene therapy might lead to a successful therapy. 
Our Treatment Approach 
We are seeking to develop an AAV gene therapy approach that we believe will deliver a functional version of the FXN gene to the sensory pathways through intravenous injection. We think this approach has the potential to improve balance, ability to walk, sensory capability, coordination, strength and functional capacity of Friedreich’s ataxia patients. Most Friedreich’s ataxia patients produce low levels of the frataxin protein, which although insufficient to prevent the disease, exposes the patient’s immune system to frataxin. This reduces the likelihood that the FXN protein expressed by AAV gene therapy will trigger a harmful immune response. 
Preclinical Studies 
We initially conducted preclinical studies in non-human primates and achieved high FXN expression levels within the target sensory ganglia, or clusters of neurons, along the spinal region following intrathecal injection. More recently, we conducted preclinical studies in non-human primates with IV injection and achieved target FXN expression levels within sensory ganglia and the heart. The levels of FXN expression observed using an AAV vector were, on average, greater than FXN levels present in control normal human brain tissue. FXN expression was also observed in the cerebellar dentate nucleus, another area of the CNS that is often affected in Friedreich’s ataxia, and that is often considered difficult to target therapeutically. 
Our Program Status 
As part of the Neurocrine Collaboration, we are developing VY-FXN01 for the treatment of Friedreich’s ataxia. VY-FXN01 is currently in preclinical development. We and Neurocrine are in the process of identifying a lead candidate that will comprise a capsid, promoter, and FXN transgene. We are completing AAV capsid biodistribution experiments to confirm capsid serotypes that effectively transduce disease target tissues in non-human primates following intravenous injection. Criteria for evaluating these capsids include safety, the overall level of transgene expression achieved, and the anatomic and cellular distribution of the transgene expression. Also, we have optimized the promoter for VY-FXN01 to achieve an acceptable therapeutic index for frataxin replacement. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of our vectors, we have conducted testing in a new genetic mouse model of Friedreich’s ataxia. In this preclinical model of Friedreich’s ataxia, our gene therapy candidates durably improved sensory function and rescued the disease phenotype based on multiple functional tests. In physiological and behavioral assays, our gene therapy candidates demonstrated dose-dependent and durable responses for more than 10 months after a single administration, preventing central and peripheral disease progression. We also have a significant effort focused on better understanding the clinical course of Friedreich’s ataxia, identifying potential fluid biomarkers and selecting clinical endpoints for future clinical trials. As part of our portfolio reevaluation and strategic shift to invest in novel capsid development efforts, we and Neurocrine are evaluating the potential use of our TRACER capsids to allow for enhanced transduction across the disease target tissues. If we and 



Neurocrine successfully identify a development candidate and capsid for this program, we plan to complete IND enabling studies to evaluate its safety and efficacy.

Parkinson’s Disease: VY-AADC Program
Disease and VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) Overview 
Parkinson’s disease is a chronic, progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative disease that affects approximately 1 million people in the United States and 10 million people worldwide. Parkinson’s disease is characterized by a loss of dopamine and its function. Dopamine is a chemical “messenger” that is produced in the brain and is involved in the control of movement. Some chemicals, like dopamine, are made from other chemicals by proteins called enzymes. Dopamine is made in the brain when the enzyme AADC (aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase) converts the chemical levodopa to dopamine. Levodopa, AADC, and dopamine are each present at normal levels in healthy people.
When dopamine levels decrease in the brain and there is no longer enough to control movement, the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease including tremors, slow movement or loss of movement, rigidity, and postural instability, may occur. When this happens, a doctor may prescribe a levodopa medication, which is converted into dopamine by AADC in substantially the same way that naturally occurring levodopa is converted to dopamine.
As Parkinson’s disease worsens, there is less AADC enzyme in parts of the brain where it is needed to convert levodopa to dopamine. Therefore, the amount of dopamine that is produced from each dose of levodopa medicine may be reduced. When this happens, patients’ motor function may worsen and a less predictable response to medications may occur.
The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale, or UPDRS, is a standard and widely used four-part clinical rating scale for Parkinson’s disease that evaluates cognitive, functional, and motor deficits, as well as medication-related complications. UPDRS Part III measures motor function by physician examination. The UPDRS is conducted when patients are taking their Parkinson’s disease medications (referred to as “on” medication) and when patients are not taking their Parkinson’s disease medications (referred to as “off” medication). In addition, a patient-completed Hauser diary records the patient’s motor response over the course of several days as ON time when they have good mobility with or without non-troublesome dyskinesia, or uncontrolled, involuntary movement; OFF time when they have poor mobility; and ON time with troublesome dyskinesia when they have uncontrolled movements. As shown in the figure below, diary ON time decreases, while OFF time and dyskinesias increase as patients progress from the early honeymoon period into later stages of Parkinson’s disease. 
Our investigational gene therapy VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) is designed to put the AADC enzyme into brain cells where it can convert levodopa to dopamine. To do this, the AADC gene is delivered inside a transporter, much like a letter that carries the instructions the brain needs to make the AADC enzyme with the AAV as the envelope that carries the letter.



VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) Phase 1 Clinical Development 
We evaluated the delivery of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) in a transfrontal (i.e., top of the head) surgical delivery route in a Phase 1b clinical trial, which we refer to as PD-1101, and explored the delivery of VY-AADC (NBIb1817) using a posterior trajectory (i.e., back of the head) surgical delivery route in a Phase 1 clinical trial, which we refer to as PD-1102. PD-1101 was an open-label, dose-ranging, Phase 1b clinical trial for VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) to evaluate safety and efficacy. We enrolled 15 patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease and assessed increased volume or concentration of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) in three separate cohorts consisting of five patients in each cohort. PD-1102 was a separate, open-label Phase 1 clinical trial for VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) to evaluate the posterior trajectory that enrolled eight patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease. We have completed PD-1101, and have completed three-year follow-up for patients in PD-1102. Data to date from both trials demonstrate that VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) has been generally well tolerated and that administration with VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) resulted in stable or improved motor function and quality of life as measured by standard scores and measures used in Parkinson’s disease trials. 
VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) RESTORE-1 Program 
In December 2017, we submitted an IND to the FDA to evaluate VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) in the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial, a randomized, double-blind, sham-surgery controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) for the treatment of moderate to advanced Parkinson’s disease in patients with motor fluctuations. In connection with our clinical development of VY-AADC (NBIb-1817), we shifted from production using a mammalian cell system consisting of triple-transfection of HEK293 cells, which was used in our two Phase 1 and Phase 1b clinical trials, to production using insect-derived cells and our baculovirus/Sf9 manufacturing process. We designed our baculovirus/Sf9 manufacturing process to be able to produce AAV vectors at clinical and commercial scale, with the potential for increased yields and more efficient scalability compared with mammalian-based systems. As part of the IND application for VY-AADC (NBIb-1817), the CMC section included data demonstrating comparability between VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) produced using our baculovirus/Sf9 manufacturing process and VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) produced using the mammalian cell system. In each case, the VY-AADC was produced under cGMP. The data demonstrated that this production platform change resulted in comparable vector quality and activity. As a result, we decided to use VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) manufactured in our baculovirus/Sf9 system in the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial. 



In December 2018, we announced randomization of the first patient in the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial. We received written feedback from the FDA, including FDA guidance received during the Type B meeting, that in a disease such as Parkinson’s, two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials are suggested. Based upon feedback received from the FDA, we and Neurocrine amended the RESTORE-1 clinical trial protocol to support a potential future registration filing for VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease in the United States. The protocol amendments included increasing the planned enrollment to approximately 85 patients from the previously planned 42 patients and adjusting future enrollment in the trial to randomize patients 2:1 to VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) or sham-surgery, respectively, as compared to the previous 1:1 randomization. The eligibility criteria remained substantially the same: the trial is potentially available to patients who have been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease for at least four years, are not responding adequately to oral medications, and have at least three or more hours of OFF time during the day as measured by a validated self-reported patient diary. The protocol amendments were anticipated to facilitate enrollment and patient convenience. 
A dose of up to 3.6 x 1012 vector genomes, which we refer to as the maximum total bilateral dose, was selected for the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial. This dose is between the maximum total vector genome doses administered in Cohorts 2 and 3 from PD-1101 when considering the higher volume administered with the posterior trajectory and vector produced using the baculovirus system. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial was the mean improvement from baseline to 12 months in good ON time as measured by a validated self-reported patient diary at 12 months compared to sham surgery. Secondary endpoints included mean improvement in diary OFF time, other motor function and quality of life measures from the UPDRS (UPDRS-II and -III scores), assessments from the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire, or PDQ-39, and patient’s global function as measured by the proportion of participants with improvement on the Clinical Global Impression, or CGI, score. The trial also was designed to measure non-motor symptoms from the Non-Motor Symptom Scale, or NMSS, as well as safety. 
Changes in patients’ daily doses of oral levodopa and related medications were also to be recorded. Biomarker data to be collected during the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial included measurements of the coverage of the putamen, the specific region of the brain targeted with VY-AADC (NBIb-1817), and measurements of AADC enzyme expression and activity in the putamen measured by positron emission tomography using 18-F-fluorodopa. 
In November 2020, the sponsor medical monitor and surgical core requested that the Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, for the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial, review certain patient MRI abnormalities observed in some clinical trial participants in the clinical trial. Following this review, the DSMB requested additional information about magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities observed in trial participants and recommended a pause in the dosing of patients in the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial pending review by the DSMB of these additional data. The DSMB informed Neurocrine that patient screening could continue for the trial and that the trial should remain blinded. Trial sites participating in the RESTORE-1 clinical trial were not screening, enrolling, or dosing patients at the time of this DSMB request as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the DSMB’s recommendation to pause the dosing of patients, we and Neurocrine decided to delay the planned resumption of patient screening in the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial until Neurocrine had submitted the required expedited IND safety report related to these matters and the DSMB was able to complete its evaluation. 
In December 2020, the FDA notified Neurocrine that it had placed a clinical hold on the RESTORE-1 clinical trial. In January 2021, the FDA informed Neurocrine of the information required to provide a complete response to the FDA in connection with the clinical hold. Information required by the FDA included an assessment of how the investigational product may have given rise to the adverse findings, a mitigation plan to manage the adverse findings, and supportive data to justify that a favorable benefit/risk profile remains for the product. 
The DSMB met to review additional patient data in January 2021 and characterized the MRI abnormalities observed in the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial as having uncertain clinical significance. The DSMB requested that Neurocrine obtain and provide additional information on past and current patients in the VY-AADC (NBIb-1817) clinical program. The clinical implications of this observation are currently unknown. 




In February 2021, Neurocrine notified us of its decision to terminate the Neurocrine Collaboration with respect to the VY-AADC Program, effective August 2, 2021. Upon the termination of the VY-AADC Program, the license granted by us to Neurocrine for the VY-AADC Program expired, we regained worldwide intellectual property rights to the VY-AADC Program in accordance with the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, and the restrictions on us to develop, manufacture or commercialize a gene therapy product directed to the specified target of the VY-AADC Program terminated. We are supporting Neurocrine, the study sponsor and IND holder, on ongoing matters related to the completion of imaging and clinical assessments requested by the DSMB and the provision of other information requested by the FDA for the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial. 
As a result of the portfolio reevaluation efforts that took place in August 2021 and our strategic shift to invest in TRACER capsid development efforts, we determined that we would not advance the VY-AADC program on our own. We may evaluate potential options for partnering the future development and commercialization of VY-AADC program.
Collaborations and License Agreements
Pfizer Option and License Agreement
On October 1, 2021, or the Pfizer Effective Date, we entered into the Pfizer License Agreement with Pfizer pursuant to which we granted Pfizer the License Options to TRACER capsids to develop and commercialize certain AAV gene therapy candidates comprised of a capsid and specified Pfizer Transgenes. Under the terms of the Pfizer License Agreement, Pfizer intends to evaluate the potential use of the capsids in combination with up to two Pfizer Transgenes to help treat respective central nervous system and cardiovascular diseases. 
Research and License Option
Immediately following the Pfizer Effective Date, we delivered to Pfizer certain quantities of materials encoding specified capsids, or the Existing Capsid Candidates, such that those capsids may be evaluated by Pfizer.

Subject to a cure period, either party may terminate the Pfizer License Agreement, in whole or in part, subject to specified conditions, in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. Pfizer may also terminate the Pfizer License Agreement, in whole or in part, subject to specified conditions, for our insolvency, the occurrence of a violation of global trade control laws, or for our non-compliance with certain anti-bribery or anti-corruption covenants. Pfizer may terminate the Pfizer License Agreement, in whole or in part, for any or no reason upon ninety days’ written notice to us. 
Upon certain terminations for cause by Pfizer, the licenses granted by us to Pfizer under the Pfizer License Agreement shall become irrevocable and perpetual, and all milestone payments and royalties that would have otherwise been payable by Pfizer under such licenses had the Pfizer License Agreement remained in effect would be substantially reduced.
Novartis Option and License Agreement
On the Novartis Effective Date, we entered into the Novartis License Agreement with our collaborative partner Novartis. Pursuant to the Novartis License Agreement, we have granted Novartis the Novartis License Options to exclusively license Novartis Licensed Capsids to develop and commercialize certain adeno-associated virus gene therapy candidates comprised of a Novartis Licensed Capsid and the Novartis Payload. 
Research and License Option 
During the Novartis Research Term, commencing on the Novartis Effective Date and ending on the first anniversary thereof or, in the event Novartis exercises a Novartis License Option, the third anniversary thereof, we have granted Novartis a non-exclusive research license to evaluate our TRACER capsids, in combination with Novartis Payloads, in programs targeting three Initial Novartis Targets. Upon the payment of an additional fee, Novartis may also assess our TRACER capsids in up to two Additional Novartis Targets, subject to certain conditions including that such target is not part of, or reasonably competitive with, our current development programs. During the Novartis Research Term, we may, at our sole discretion and expense, conduct further research activities to identify additional TRACER capsids. If we elect to do so, we have agreed to disclose performance characteristics of such new TRACER capsids to Novartis on a rolling basis.
During the Novartis Research Term, Novartis may exercise up to three Novartis License Options—or up to five Novartis License Options if Novartis is evaluating the Additional Novartis Targets—in the aggregate, provided that Novartis may only exercise one Novartis License Option for each Novartis Target. Upon the exercise of any Novartis License Option, we have agreed to grant Novartis an exclusive, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, under certain of our intellectual property, the rights to develop and commercialize the Novartis Licensed Products.

Exclusivity
Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, we have agreed (i) during the Novartis Research Term, not to conduct any internal program or program on behalf of a third party that is directed to the development or commercialization of any our capsids, or grant any third party or affiliate any right or license under our rights in such capsids, to exploit any therapeutic product containing a capsid in combination with a payload designed to have therapeutic effect on any of the Targets; and (ii) after Novartis’s exercise of any License Option, not to grant any third party or affiliate any right or license under our patents to exploit any Novartis Licensed Capsid for the applicable Target.



Termination
Unless earlier terminated, the Novartis License Agreement expires on the earlier to occur of (i) the first anniversary of the Novartis Effective Date, if no License Option is exercised, and (ii) the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term with respect to all Novartis Licensed Products in all countries if at least one Novartis License Option is exercised. Subject to a cure period, either party may terminate the Novartis License Agreement, in whole or in part, subject to specified conditions, in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. Novartis may also terminate the Novartis License Agreement, in whole or in part, subject to specified conditions, for our insolvency, the occurrence of a violation of global trade control laws, or for our non-compliance with certain anti-bribery or anti-corruption covenants. Novartis may terminate the Novartis License Agreement, in whole or in part, for any or no reason upon ninety days’ written notice to us.
Upon certain terminations for cause by Novartis, the licenses granted by us to Novartis under the Novartis License Agreement shall become irrevocable and perpetual, and all milestone payments and royalties that would have otherwise been payable by Novartis under such licenses had the Novartis License Agreement remained in effect would be substantially reduced.
Neurocrine Collaboration
In January 2019, we entered into the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement for the research, development and commercialization of certain of our AAV gene therapy products. Under the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, we agreed to collaborate on the conduct of four collaboration programs, which we refer to collectively as the Neurocrine Programs: the VY-AADC Program for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, the FA Program for the treatment of Friedreich’s ataxia including the development of the VY-FXN01 product candidate, which together with the VY-AADC Program, we refer to as the Legacy Programs, and the Discovery Programs. On February 2, 2021, Neurocrine notified us that it elected to terminate the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement solely with regards to the VY-AADC Program, effective August 2, 2021.
Collaboration and Licenses
Under the terms of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, subject to the rights retained by us thereunder, we agreed to collaborate with Neurocrine on, and to grant, exclusive, royalty-bearing, non-transferable, sublicensable licenses to certain of our intellectual property rights, for all human and veterinary diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic uses, for the research, development, and commercialization of gene therapy products, which we refer to as the Collaboration Products, under (i) the VY-AADC Program, on a worldwide basis; (ii) the FA Program, in the United States and, all countries in the world in which the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement remains in effect with respect to the FA Program; and (iii) each Discovery Program, on a worldwide basis. Licenses related to the VY-AADC Program terminated in August 2021.
As a result of the June 2019 Sanofi Genzyme Termination Agreement, we gained worldwide rights to the Huntington’s disease program for VY-HTT01 and ex-U.S. rights to the FA program. We subsequently transferred the ex-U.S. rights to the FA Program to Neurocrine pursuant to the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement. To facilitate our transfer of the ex-U.S. rights to the FA Program to Neurocrine, we and Neurocrine amended the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement and we received a $5.0 million payment from Neurocrine.
​
Pursuant to development plans to be agreed by the parties, which are overseen by a joint steering committee, or JSC, we have operational responsibility, subject to certain exceptions, for the conduct of each Neurocrine Program prior to the Transition Event for each Program, as described below, and are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the Collaboration Products. Neurocrine has agreed to be responsible for all costs incurred by us in conducting these activities for each Neurocrine Program, in accordance with an agreed budget. If we breach our development responsibilities or in certain circumstances upon a change in control of us, Neurocrine has the right but not the obligation to assume the activities under such Neurocrine Program.
 ​



Upon the occurrence of a specified event for each Neurocrine Program, or a Transition Event, Neurocrine agreed to assume responsibility for development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for such Neurocrine Program from us and to pay milestones and royalties on future net sales as described further below. For each Legacy Program, we were granted the option, or a Co-Co Option, to co-develop and co-commercialize such Neurocrine Program upon the occurrence of a specified event, or a Co-Co Trigger Event. We agreed, upon our exercise of a Co-Co Option, to enter into a cost- and profit-sharing arrangement with Neurocrine, or a Co-Co Agreement, and (i) jointly develop and commercialize Collaboration Products for such Neurocrine Program, or Co-Co Products, (ii) share in its costs, profits and losses, and (iii) forfeit certain milestones and royalties on net sales in the United States during the effective period of the applicable Co-Co Agreement. The Co-Co Option has expired, and the Transition Event and the Co-Co Trigger Event are no longer applicable, with respect to the VY-AADC Program in light of the termination of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement with respect to the program. The remaining Transition Events are (i) with respect to the FA Program, our receipt of topline data for the initial Phase 1 clinical trial for an FA Program product candidate; and (ii) with respect to each Discovery Program, the preparation by us and the approval by Neurocrine of an IND application to be filed with the FDA by Neurocrine for the first development candidate in such Discovery Program. The Co-Co Trigger Event for the FA Program is the achievement of milestones or metrics specified in the applicable development plan, as determined by the JSC.
Under the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, subject to exceptions specified, we and Neurocrine agreed that profits and losses under our Co-Co Option would be allocated (i) 50% to Neurocrine and 50% to us for a Collaboration Product from the VY-AADC Program and (ii) 60% to Neurocrine and 40% to us for a Collaboration Product from the FA Program; provided, however, that Neurocrine would have the right to elect, within a specified period following the acceptance for filing of a biologics license application, or BLA, from the FDA, to pay a $35.0 million rate-shifting fee to us to change the allocation for the VY-AADC Program to 55% to Neurocrine and 45% to us. The parties agreed that each Co-Co Agreement would provide us the right to terminate for any reason upon prior written notice to Neurocrine and Neurocrine the right to terminate in certain circumstances upon our change of control.
Governance
Our research and development activities under the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement are to be conducted pursuant to plans agreed to by the parties, on a program-by-program basis, and overseen by the JSC, which is composed of an equal number of representatives from the parties. The JSC may delegate matters within its authority to subcommittees of the JSC. In addition, the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement establishes working groups to handle specified matters on a subject matter-by-subject matter basis. If a working group or subcommittee cannot agree on a matter within its purview within a specified time, such matter is to be referred sequentially to the JSC and then the executive officers of the parties. If the executive officers are not able to resolve the matter, then (i) with respect to each Legacy Program, subject to specified exceptions, (a) Neurocrine has the right to resolve such matter prior to our exercise of our Co-Co Option with regard to such Co-Co Product or if such Co-Co Option expires or goes unexercised and (b) following the timely exercise by us of our Co-Co Option, depending on the subject of such matter, either Neurocrine, in certain instances, or the parties jointly or the JSC, in other instances, would have the right to resolve such matter, and (ii) with respect to Discovery Programs, subject to specified exceptions, Neurocrine has the right to resolve such matter.
Candidate Selection
The parties have committed to agree on a list of up to eight target genes, or Targets, from which Neurocrine has the right to nominate Targets for the two Discovery Programs. The Targets nominated for the Discovery Programs must be approved by a consensus of the JSC or the executive officers. 
Manufacturing
Prior to the Transition Event for a Neurocrine Program, we are responsible for the manufacture of any Collaboration Products for the Program. Following the Transition Event, the parties shall negotiate the manufacturing and supply responsibilities, subject to the terms of any applicable Co-Co Agreement.



Financial Terms
Under the terms of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, Neurocrine has paid us an upfront payment of $115.0 million. In connection with the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, Neurocrine also paid us $50.0 million as consideration for an equity purchase of 4,179,728 shares of our common stock. The Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement provides for aggregate development milestone payments from Neurocrine to us for Collaboration Products under (i) the VY-AADC Program of up to $170.0 million, which we are no longer eligible to receive in light of the partial termination of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement; (ii) the FA Program of up to $195.0 million, and (iii) each of the two Discovery Programs of up to $130.0 million per Discovery Program. We may be entitled to receive aggregate commercial milestone payments for each Collaboration Product of up to $275.0 million, subject to an aggregate cap on commercial milestone payments across all Neurocrine Programs of $1.1 billion.

Neurocrine has also agreed to pay us royalties, based on future net sales of the Collaboration Products. Such royalty percentages, for net sales in and outside the United States, as applicable, range (i) for the VY-AADC Program, from the mid-teens to thirty and the low-teens to twenty, respectively, which we are no longer eligible to receive in light of the partial termination of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement; (ii) for the FA Program, from the low-teens to high-teens and high-single digits to mid-teens, respectively; and (iii) for each Discovery Program, from the high-single digits to mid-teens and mid-single digits to low-teens, respectively. On a country-by-country and program-by-program basis, royalty payments would commence on the first commercial sale of a Collaboration Product and terminate on the later of (a) the expiration of the last patent covering the Collaboration Product or its method of use in such country, (b) 10 years from the first commercial sale of the Collaboration Product in such country and (c) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country, or the Royalty Term. Royalty payments may be reduced by up to 50% in specified circumstances, including expiration of patents rights related to a Collaboration Product, approval of biosimilar products in a given country or required payment of licensing fees to third parties related to the development and commercialization of any Collaboration Product. Additionally, the licenses granted to Neurocrine shall automatically convert to fully paid-up, non-royalty bearing, perpetual, irrevocable, exclusive licenses on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the expiration of the Royalty Term applicable to such Collaboration Product in such country.
Intellectual Property
Under the terms of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement and subject to specified exceptions therein, each party owns the entire right, title and interest in and to all intellectual property rights made solely by its employees or agents in the course of the collaboration. The parties jointly own all rights, title and interest in and to all intellectual property rights made or invented jointly by employees or agents of both parties.
Exclusivity
During the term of the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, neither party nor any of its respective affiliates is permitted to directly or indirectly exploit any AAV-based gene therapy products directed to a Target to which a Collaboration Product is directed, subject to specified exceptions, including the parties’ conduct of basic research activities.
​
Termination
Unless earlier terminated, the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement expires on the later of (i) the expiration of the last to expire Royalty Term with respect to a Collaboration Product in all countries in the relevant territory or (ii) the expiration or termination of all Co-Co Agreements. Neurocrine may terminate the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or on a program-by-program or country-by-country basis by providing at least (a) 180-day advance notice if such notice is provided prior to the first commercial sale of the Collaboration Product to which the termination applies or (b) one-year advance notice if such notice is provided after the first commercial sale of the Collaboration Product to which the termination applies. We may terminate the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement, subject to specified conditions, if Neurocrine challenges the validity or enforceability of certain of our intellectual property rights. Subject to 




a cure period, either party may terminate the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party in whole or in part, subject to specified conditions. 

Upon termination in certain cases, Neurocrine has agreed to grant to us licenses to certain Neurocrine intellectual property, subject to a negotiation between the parties to establish royalty rates for use of such intellectual property. In the event of a breach by us with respect to a Neurocrine Program, if such termination were to occur after a Transition Event, then (i) if a Co-Co Agreement is in effect with respect to such program, Neurocrine can terminate the Co-Co Agreement for such program and we would no longer have co-development and co-commercialization rights with respect to the Collaboration Product and (ii) subject to any license agreements, Neurocrine would no longer have any obligations with respect to any Collaboration Products resulting from such program.

On February 2, 2021, Neurocrine notified us that it had elected to terminate the Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement solely with regards to the VY-AADC Program, effective as of the Neurocrine VY-AADC Program Termination Effective Date. The Neurocrine Collaboration Agreement remains in full force and effect for each other program thereunder. As a result of the termination, as of the Neurocrine VY-AADC Program Termination Effective Date, the license granted by us to Neurocrine thereunder regarding the VY-AADC Program expired and we regained worldwide intellectual property rights regarding the VY-AADC Program. We are supporting Neurocrine, the study sponsor and IND holder, on ongoing matters related to the completion of imaging and clinical assessments requested by the DSMB and the provision of other information requested by the FDA for the RESTORE-1 Phase 2 clinical trial. 
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop into products and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our gene therapy platform, product programs, product candidates and scientific expertise in the fields of gene therapy and neuroscience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. 
We are aware of several companies focused on developing AAV gene therapies in various indications, including AAVANTIBio, Inc., Abeona Therapeutics, Inc., Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc., Aevitas Therapeutics, Inc., Alcyone Therapeutics, Inc., Amicus Therapeutics, Inc., Apic Bio, Inc., Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, Asklepios BioPharmaceutical, Inc., or AskBio (acquired by Bayer), Audentes Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by Astellas Pharma Inc.), Biogen, Inc., or Biogen, Brain Neurotherapy Bio, Inc. (merged with AskBio), Encoded Therapeutics, Inc., GenSight Biologics SA, Homology Medicines, Inc., LEXEO Therapeutics, Inc., LogicBio Therapeutics, Inc., Lysogene SA, MeiraGTx Ltd., or MeiraGTx, Neurogene, Inc., Novartis Gene Therapies, Inc. (formerly AveXis, Inc.), Passage Bio, Inc., Pfizer, Inc., Prevail Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by Eli Lilly), PTC Therapeutics, Inc., REGENXBio Inc., Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., Sio Gene Therapies, Inc., Solid Biosciences, Inc., Spark Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by Roche), StrideBio, Inc., Taysha Gene Therapies, Inc. and uniQure, as well as several companies addressing other methods for modifying genes and regulating gene expression. Any advances in gene therapy technology made by a competitor may be used to develop therapies that could compete against any of our product candidates. 
We expect that our preclinical programs will compete with a variety of therapies in development, including:

● | Our program for Huntington’s disease will potentially compete with TAK-686 being developed by Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. in collaboration with Takeda, and AMT-130, an AAV gene therapy being developed by uniQure and a gene therapy being developed by Spark;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our program for a monogenic form of ALS will potentially compete with BIIB067 (IONIS-SOD1Rx) being developed by Biogen, in collaboration with Ionis, and gene therapies being developed by Novartis Gene Therapies, Inc. and Apic Bio, Inc.;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of product candidates and commercializing those product candidates. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for product candidates and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ product candidates may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product candidate we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. 
Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new product candidates enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any product candidates that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
Manufacturing 
The manufacture of gene therapy products is technically complex, and necessitates substantial expertise and capital investment. Production difficulties caused by unforeseen events may delay the availability of material for our clinical studies. To meet the requirements of our current and planned future trials we have developed a proprietary manufacturing platform that provides a robust and scalable process for AAV production. We are using the 




baculovirus/Sf9 AAV production system, a technology for producing AAV vectors at scale in insect-derived cells. We focus on developing internal processes and capabilities to produce high-yield and high-quality gene therapies. The process has been successfully transferred to our contract manufacturing organizations where it has been used in manufacturing of clinical materials in accordance with the FDA’s cGMP. We have also built an onsite, state-of-the-art process research and development facility to enable the manufacturing of high quality AAV gene therapy vectors at research scale.

We presently contract with third parties for the manufacturing of our program materials. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. The use of contracted manufacturing and reliance on collaboration partners is relatively cost-efficient and we believe that it eliminates the need for our direct investment in manufacturing facilities and additional staff early in development. Although we expect to rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with manufacturing and quality experience to oversee our contract manufacturers.
Intellectual Property
Overview 
We strive to protect the proprietary technology, inventions, and know-how to enhance improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology platform, on continuing technological innovation and on in-licensing opportunities to develop, improve and maintain the strength of our position in the field of gene therapy that may be important for the development of our business. We additionally may rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available. 
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other protections for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and intellectual property rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, having made, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases, these rights may need to be enforced by third-party licensors. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same. 
We own at least 351 pending patent applications and at least 41 patents have issued in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We co-own at least 42 pending patent applications and at least 3 patents have issued from these co-owned families in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. At least 16 patent applications have been filed and are pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions by or on behalf of universities which have granted us exclusive license rights to the technology. To date, 80 patents have issued to our licensors which have granted us exclusive license rights to the technology. To date, 149 patents have issued to our licensors which have granted us non-exclusive license rights to the technology with 37 applications pending. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We seek United States and international patent protection for a variety of technologies, including: AAV-based biological products and constructs, methods of delivering said AAV-based biological products and constructs, methods of treating diseases of interest, as well as methods of engineering and manufacturing of the same. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel biological products. We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. We are a party to various other license agreements that give us rights to use specific technologies in our research and development.

We plan to register trademarks in connection with our biological products. 
Trade Secret Protection 
Finally, we may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 

Government Regulation 
The research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, packaging, labeling, storage, record-keeping, distribution, import, export, promotion, advertising, marketing, sale, pricing and reimbursement of biologic products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The processes for obtaining 




regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory requirements, both pre-approval and post-approval, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The regulatory requirements applicable to biological product development, approval and marketing are subject to change, and regulations and administrative guidance often are revised or reinterpreted by the agencies in ways that may have a significant impact on our business.
U.S. Government Regulation
U.S. Biological Products Development Process 
In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates gene therapy products as biological products, or biologics. These products are licensed for marketing under the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. A company, institution, or organization which takes responsibility for the initiation and management of a clinical development program for such products, and for their regulatory approval, is typically referred to as a sponsor.
The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to GLPs and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation of clinical trial material in accordance with cGMPs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | design of a clinical protocol and submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee representing each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety, purity, potency, and efficacy, of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical studies, including payment of application user fees;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection prior to BLA approval of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA inspection of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA Advisory Committee meeting to elicit expert input on critical issues and including a vote by external Committee members;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with any post approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
Before a sponsor begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as other studies to evaluate, among other things, the toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act, if applicable. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and long-term toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted.
The IND and IRB Processes
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. An IND must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved NDA or BLA. In support of a request for an IND, sponsors must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial may proceed. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a partial clinical hold might state that a specific protocol or part of a protocol may not proceed, while other parts of a protocol or other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after the imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following the issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, a clinical investigation may only resume once the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed or recommence. Occasionally, clinical holds are imposed due to manufacturing issues that may present safety issues for the clinical study subjects. 
A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all IND requirements must be met unless waived by the FDA. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, the studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including undergoing review and receiving approval by an independent ethics committee and seeking and receiving informed consent from subjects. GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. 
In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB, which must operate in compliance with FDA regulations, must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects and must monitor the trial until completed. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a 




clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on review of available data from the study, to which only the DSMB maintains access. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of a clinical trial can occur if the DSMB determines that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Human Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with GCP requirements which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before they participate in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written clinical trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol, and any subsequent material amendment to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may also be required after approval.
Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population, which may be healthy volunteers or subjects with the target disease, to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or in patients. During Phase 1 clinical trials, information about the product candidate’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials. 
Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled and closely monitored. 
Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken using a larger patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 clinical trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a new biologic product. Such Phase 3 clinical trials are referred to as “pivotal” trials. 
A clinical trial may combine the elements of more than one phase and the FDA often requires more than one Phase 3 trial to support marketing approval of a product candidate. A company’s designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that the study will be sufficient to satisfy the FDA requirements of that phase because this determination cannot be made until the protocol and data have been submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. Moreover, as noted above, a pivotal trial is a clinical trial that is believed to satisfy FDA requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s safety and efficacy such that it can be used, alone or with other pivotal or non-pivotal trials, to support regulatory approval. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase 3 trials, but they may be Phase 2 trials if the design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in an area of unmet medical need.
In some cases, the FDA may approve an NDA or BLA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such 




post-approval trials, typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of a larger number of patients in the intended treatment group. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials, such as to verify clinical benefit in the case of products approved under accelerated approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting mandatory Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of FDA approval for products.
Finally, sponsors of clinical trials are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry (clinicaltrials.gov) maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH. In particular, information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. The NIH’s Final Rule on registration and reporting requirements for clinical trials became effective in 2017, and both NIH and the FDA have recently signaled the government’s willingness to begin enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors. The failure to submit clinical trial information to clinicaltrials.gov, as required, is a prohibited act under the FDCA with violations subject to potential civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each day the violation continues.
Gene Therapy Products
We expect that the procedures and standards applied to gene therapy products will be applied to any product candidates we may develop. The FDA has defined a gene therapy product as one that seeks to modify or manipulate the expression of a gene or to alter the biological properties of living cells for therapeutic use. The products may be used to modify cells in vivo or transferred to cells ex vivo prior to administration to the recipient. Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies, or OTAT, and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. The NIH, including the NExTRAC also advises the FDA on gene therapy issues and other issues related to emerging biotechnologies. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols.
The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, including final guidance documents released in January 2020 relating to chemistry, manufacturing and controls information for gene therapy INDs, long-term follow-up after the administration of gene therapy products, gene therapies for rare diseases and gene therapies for retinal disorders, as well as draft guidance in January 2021 for Human Gene Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases. Although the FDA has indicated that these and other guidance documents it previously issued are not legally binding, compliance with them is likely necessary to gain approval for any gene therapy product candidate. The guidance documents provide additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing and control information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe for potential delayed adverse effects in participants who have received investigational gene therapies with the duration of follow-up based on the potential for risk of such effects. For AAV vectors specifically, the FDA typically recommends that sponsors continue to monitor participants for potential gene therapy-related adverse events for up to a five-year period.
Until 2019, most gene therapy clinical trials in the United States required pre-review by the predecessor of NExTRAC before being approved by the IRBs and any local biosafety boards or being allowed to proceed by the FDA. In 2019, the NIH substantially eliminated the pre-review process and going forward, the review of gene therapy clinical trial protocols would be largely handled by local IRBs and institutional biosafety committees, or IBCs, in addition to the FDA. Furthermore, in 2019, the NIH removed from public access the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System database, which previously contained substantial amounts of safety and other participant information regarding human gene therapy trials performed up to that time.



Manufacturing and Other Regulatory Requirements
Concurrently with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies, develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the finished product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Specifically, the FDA’s regulations require that pharmaceutical products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceuticals are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies, and they are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements. Inspections must follow a “risk-based schedule” that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated. Changes to the manufacturing process, specifications or container closure system for an approved product are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. The FDA’s regulations also require, among other things, the investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and the imposition of reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers involved in producing the approved product.
Pediatric Studies
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, applications and certain types of supplements to applications must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an End-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The sponsor and the FDA must reach agreement on a final plan. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. 
For investigational products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of a sponsor, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, the FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors, and the FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than ninety days after the FDA’s receipt of the study plan.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the sponsor, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product or therapeutic candidate is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric trials begin. The law now requires the FDA to send a PREA Non-Compliance letter to sponsors who have failed to submit their pediatric assessments required under PREA, have failed to seek or obtain a deferral or deferral extension or have failed to request approval for a required pediatric formulation. It further 




requires the FDA to publicly post the PREA Non-Compliance letter and sponsor’s response. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation, although FDA has recently taken steps to limit what it considers abuse of this statutory exemption in PREA by announcing that it does not intend to grant any additional orphan drug designations for rare pediatric subpopulations of what is otherwise a common disease. The FDA also maintains a list of diseases that are exempt from PREA requirements due to low prevalence of disease in the pediatric population.
Submission of a BLA to the FDA
FDA approval is required before any new gene therapy product or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved gene therapy product, can be marketed in the United States. Thus, assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational gene therapy product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee unless an exception or waiver applies, such as the first application filed by a small business or BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate includes an indication that is not for a rare disease or condition. 
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all applications within 60 days of receipt and must inform the sponsor at that time or before whether an application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. In pertinent part, FDA’s regulations state that an application “shall not be considered as filed until all pertinent information and data have been received” by the FDA. In the event that FDA determines that an application does not satisfy this standard, it will issue a Refuse to File, or RTF, determination to the sponsor. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted.
If the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review the BLA, within ten months for a standard review, or, if the BLA relates to an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition, perform a priority review, within six months. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or in the case of a clarification provided by the sponsor to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. Despite these review goals, it is not uncommon for FDA review of an application to extend beyond the PDUFA target action date.
The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a REMS is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
In connection with its review of a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, a sponsor must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control. 
The FDA’s Decision on a BLA
The FDA reviews an application to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, pure and potent for its intended use(s), with the latter determination being made on the basis of substantial evidence. The FDA has interpreted this evidentiary standard to require at least two adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations to 



establish the efficacy of a new product. Under certain circumstances, however, FDA has indicated that a single trial with certain characteristics and additional information may satisfy this standard. After evaluating the application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendations, if any, and inspection reports of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA will issue either a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, or an approval letter. To reach this determination, the FDA must determine that the expected benefits of the proposed product outweigh its potential risks to patients.
A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The CRL may require additional clinical or other data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time- consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor will have one year to respond to the deficiencies identified by the FDA, at which time the FDA can deem the application withdrawn or, in its discretion, grant the sponsor an additional six-month extension to respond. 
An approval letter, on the other hand, authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. That is, the approval will be limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the FDA-approved labeling. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Post-Approval Requirements
Gene therapy products manufactured or distributed pursuant to regulatory approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the regulatory authorities, including, among other things, requirements relating to formal commitments for post approval clinical trials and studies, manufacturing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior regulatory authority review and approval.
Manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities and country or state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior regulatory approval before being implemented. Regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
Further, although physicians may prescribe legally available products for unapproved uses or patient populations, which are commonly referred to as “off-label uses,” manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. In September 2021, the FDA published final regulations which describe the types of evidence that the agency will consider in determining the intended use of a biologic. If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, as well as state authorities.




Expedited Review Programs
The FDA is authorized to expedite the review of applications in several ways. None of these expedited programs, however, changes the standards for approval but each may help expedite the development or approval process governing product candidates.

● | Fast Track Designation. Candidate products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track application before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review and rolling review.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Priority review. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, it would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention compared to marketed products. FDA aims to complete its review of priority review applications within six months as opposed to ten months for standard review.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accelerated approval. Biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Regenerative advanced therapy. With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.

U.S. Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
A gene therapy product may qualify for orphan drug designation, or ODD, under the Orphan Drug Act, if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States 




for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. ODD must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants ODD, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. ODD entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. ODD does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
If a gene therapy product that has ODD receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same gene therapy product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as not being able to supply the product for patients or showing clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of a different gene therapy for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan-drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same gene therapy as defined by the FDA. 
Orphan drug products are also eligible for Rare Pediatric Disease Designation if greater than 50% of patients living with the disease are under age 18. A priority review voucher will be given to the sponsor of a product with a Rare Pediatric Disease Designation at the time of product approval that is transferable to another company.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
When a biological product is licensed for marketing by FDA with approval of a BLA, the product may be entitled to certain types of market and data exclusivity barring FDA from approving competing products for certain periods of time. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, was enacted in the United States and included the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA. The BPCIA amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. To date, the FDA has approved a number of biosimilars and the first interchangeable biosimilar product was approved on July 30, 2021 and a second product previously approved as a biosimilar was designated as interchangeable in October 2021. 
A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. Approval of a 351(k) application may not be made effective until twelve years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, which under the statute excludes the date of licensure of supplements and certain other applications. Additionally, a 351(k) application for a biosimilar or interchangeable biological product cannot be submitted for review until four years after the date on which the reference product was first licensed under section 351(a) of the PHSA. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, however, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of their product. There have been recent government proposals to reduce the twelve-year reference product exclusivity period, but none has been enacted to date. At the same time, since passage of the BPCIA, many states have passed laws or amendments to laws, which address pharmacy practices involving biosimilar products.
Pediatric Exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including both the reference product and orphan drug exclusivity periods. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an application sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months.



U.S. Patent Term Restoration 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, less any time the sponsor failed to act with due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. 
Other Healthcare Laws 
Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we will be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states in which we conduct our business, if and when our product candidates are approved by the FDA and subject to federal healthcare reimbursement. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
Further, a primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of biologic products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for medical products and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for pharmaceutical products under government healthcare programs. The ACA is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Since enactment of the ACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
The costs of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. To date, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. For example, in October 2020, HHS and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription products from Canada into the United States. The final rule is currently the subject of ongoing litigation, but at least six states (Vermont, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Mexico, and New Hampshire) have passed laws allowing for the importation of products from Canada with the intent of developing SIPs for review and approval by the FDA. At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing 



legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription product and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
Additional Regulation 
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 
Government Regulation Outside of the United States 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials, e.g., a clinical trial application for each clinical trial for each EU country in which the trial is conducted; a clinical trial notification is required in Japan. 
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
