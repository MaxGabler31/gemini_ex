Impact of Current Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic on our Company
 
The global pandemic related to an outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) has cast uncertainty on each of these assumptions. There can be no assurance that they continue to be valid. The situation is dynamic and the ultimate duration and magnitude of the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and the financial effect on our business remain unknown at this time. These impacts could include, amongst others, an impact on our ability to obtain debt or equity financing, impairment of investments, net realizable value of inventory, impairments in the value of our long-lived assets, or potential future decreases in revenue or profitability of our ongoing operations.
History
 
We were originally incorporated in the State of Colorado in August 1998 under the name “Network Acquisitions, Inc.” We changed our name to Cavion Technologies, Inc. in February 1999 and subsequently to Concord Ventures, Inc. in October 2006.
 
On December 21, 2000, we filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. In connection with the filing, on February 16, 2001, we sold our entire business, and all of our assets, for the benefit of our creditors. After the sale, we still had liabilities of $8.4 million and were subsequently dismissed by the Court from the Chapter 11 reorganization, effective March 13, 2001, at which time the last of our remaining directors resigned. On March 13, 2001, we had no business or other source of income, no assets, no employees or directors, outstanding liabilities of approximately $8.4 million and had terminated our duty to file reports under securities law. In February 2008, we were re-listed on the OTC Bulletin Board.
 
In April 2010, we re-domiciled in Delaware under the name CCVG, Inc. (“CCVG”). Effective December 31, 2010, CCVG completed an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Reorganization") which provided for the merger of two of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. As a result of this reorganization, our name was changed to “Golden Dragon Inc.”, which became the surviving publicly quoted parent holding company.
 
On May 9, 2014, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with CannaPharmaRx, Inc., a Colorado corporation (“Canna Colorado”), and David Cutler, a former President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and director of our Company. Under the Share Purchase Agreement, Canna Colorado purchased 1,421,120 shares of our common stock from Mr. Cutler and an additional 9,000,000 restricted common shares directly from us.
 
On May 15, 2014, as amended and effective January 29, 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger”) pursuant to which Canna Colorado became a subsidiary of our Company.

In October 2014, we changed our legal name to “CannaPharmaRx, Inc.”
 
Pursuant to the Merger all of the shares of our common stock previously owned by Canna Colorado were canceled. As a result of the aforesaid transactions, we became an early-stage pharmaceutical company whose purpose was to advance cannabinoid research and discovery using proprietary formulation and drug delivery technology then under development. 
 
In April 2016, we ceased operations. Our then management resigned their respective positions with our Company with the exception of Mr. Gary Herick, who remained one of our officers and directors until April 23, 2019.
 
Effective December 31, 2018, the Company and Hanover CPMD Acquisition Corp. (“CPMD Hanover”) a newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Alternative Medical Solutions, Inc., an Ontario, Canada corporation (“AMS”), its shareholders, wherein the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of AMS. AMS is a corporation organized under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada.
 
The facility is a 48,750 square foot marijuana grow facility built on a 6.7-acre parcel of land located in Hanover, Ontario, Canada. To date, the exterior construction of the building has been completed, however, no interior construction has begun.
 
As a result of the completion of the acquisition of AMS on December 31, 2019, the Company no longer fit the definition of a “shell company,” as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act and Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. It filed the required disclosure on Form 8-K/A with the SEC on February 14, 2019, advising that it was no longer a shell company pursuant to the aforesaid Rule.
 
On January 6, 2021, the Company executed an Agreement of Purchase and Sale through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Alternative Medical Solutions Inc for the sale of the lands and premises located at Hanover, Ontario, Canada. The price was $2,000,000 CAD. As a result, and in anticipation of the closing, the Company recorded an impairment of goodwill and fixed assets relating to the property of $7,962,694 at December 31, 2020. This property was security for a $1,000,000 US Note with Koze Investments LLC by way of a first ranking charge. This transaction closed on July 9, 2021 and the note was repaid in full as principal of $1,000,000 plus accrued interest of $124,735 and penalties of $475,265. The note was discharged accordingly.
 
Effective February 25, 2019, the Company acquired 3,936,500 shares and 2,500,000 Warrants to purchase 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock of GN Ventures, Ltd, Alberta, Canada, f/k/a Great Northern Cannabis, Ltd. (“GN”), in exchange for an aggregate of 7,988,963 shares of its Common Stock, from a former shareholder of GN who is now the Company’s President and CEO. While no assurances can be provided, the Company believes this is the initial step in its efforts to acquire all or a significant portion of the issued and outstanding stock of GN. In May 2020, the Company exchanged 5,507,400 of its shares for 3,671,597 shares of GN.
 
GN owns a 60,000 square foot cannabis cultivation and grow facility located on 38 acres in Stevensville, Ontario, Canada. Because the Company is a minority shareholder of GN and GN is a privately held company, the Company cannot confirm that the information it currently has on GN’s operations is complete or fully reliable. GN estimates annual total production capacity from the Stevensville facility of up to 12,500 kilograms of cannabis. GN believes the Stevensville facility to be complete, and GN’s subsidiary, 9869247 Canada Limited, received a license to cultivate from the Canadian Ministry of Health on July 5, 2019. As a result, in October 2019, GN commenced cultivation activities and began generating revenues during the first calendar quarter of 2020. The Company expects that it will obtain additional information on the business activities of GN as it has renewed discussions to acquire additional interests and is performing its due diligence procedures.

Effective June 11, 2019, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Sunniva, Inc, a British Columbia, Canada corporation (“Sunniva”) wherein the Company agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding securities of Sunniva’s wholly-owned subsidiaries Sunniva Medical Inc. (“SMI”) and 1167025 B.C. LTD (“1167025”) for CAD $16.0 million in cash and a note in the principal amount of CAD $4.0 million. These companies are the current owners of the Sunniva Canada Campus, which includes construction assets for a planned 759,000 square-foot greenhouse located on an approximately 114-acre property in Okanagan Falls, British Columbia.
 
On June 8, 2020, the Company received a notice of termination of this Purchase Agreement, as amended, from Sunniva. As a result, the Company incurred a charge of $1,881,126 due to the write-off of its deposit to Sunniva, banking fees and prepaid expenses associated with the failed acquisition of Sunniva. The Company is in discussions with Sunniva, as well as an investment banker who received deposits from the Company, about recovering all or a portion of its deposits, banking fees, and prepaid expenses.
 
On January 6, 2022, the Company entered into a 20 year operating lease with Formosa Mountain Ltd., for a cannabis production facility in Cremona, Alberta, Canada. The facility is a 55,000 square foot, 6,000 kg per year plant, built in 2015. The licencing process is currently underway, and production and sales are anticipated in Q3, 2022.
 
Description of Current Business
 
We are involved in the cannabis industry in Canada. Our principal business activities to date have been to negotiate, acquire and develop various cannabis cultivation projects throughout Canada. We are also looking at possible opportunities in the US but as of the date of this Report we do not own or operate any businesses in the US.
 
Our activities to date have centered around three projects, including (i) the Hanover Project; (ii) the Great Northern Project; and (iii) the acquisition of Sunniva Medical, Inc. and development of a state of the art cannabis cultivation facility. Following is a description of each of these projects, how we have or intend to acquire the same and the current status of each:
 
Hanover Project
 
Effective November 19, 2018, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Alternative Medical Solutions, Inc., an Ontario, Canada corporation (“AMS”), its shareholders and Hanover CPMD Acquisition Corp., wherein we acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of AMS. As part of the material terms of this transaction, we also agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shareholder loans held by the principal shareholder of AMS. The purchase price was CAD$12,700,000, of which CAD$1,012,982 was paid at closing and we assumed debt of approximately CAD$650,000. The principal shareholders of AMS elected to receive 971,765 shares of our Common Stock in lieu of CAD$985,000 in additional cash. We granted the holders of these shares “piggyback” registration rights but we have not yet filed a registration statement to cause us to register these shares with the SEC. The balance of approximately CAD$10,000,000 is to be paid pursuant to the terms of a relevant subordinated non-interest bearing promissory note, secured only by the shares acquired in AMS Principal payments under the Promissory Note are due quarterly and are computed based upon 50% of AMS' cash flow, defined as EBITDA less all capital expenditures, taxes incurred, non-recurring items and other non-cash items for the relevant fiscal quarter, including the servicing of all senior debt payment obligations of the company. The Promissory Note matures the earlier of two years from the date AMS receives a license to cultivate or December 31, 2021.
 
In anticipation of a sale, the Company recorded an impairment of goodwill and fixed assets relating to the property of $7,962,694 during the year ended December 31, 2020.

On January 6, 2021, the Company executed an Agreement of Purchase and Sale through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Alternative Medical Solutions Inc. for the sale of the lands and premises located at Hanover, Ontario, Canada. The price was $2,000,000 CAD and the closing of this transaction occurred on July 9, 2021. This property was security for a $1,000,000 US Note with Koze Investments, LLC by way of a first-ranking charge. At closing, the Note was retired with the proceeds from the sale by repayment of the principal of $1,000,000, accrued interest of $124,735, and penalties of $475,265. The note was discharged on July 13, 2021. 
 Great Northern Acquisition
 
In early 2019 we retained new members of management who are actively engaged in the Canadian cannabis industry, including former management of GN Ventures, Ltd., Alberta, Canada, f/k/a Great Northern Cannabis, Ltd. (“GN”). Not coincidentally, effective February 25, 2019, we acquired 3,936,500 shares and 2,500,000 Warrants to purchase 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock of GN in exchange for an aggregate of 7,988,963 shares of our Common Stock, from our current CEO, who is a former shareholder of GN. We believe this is the initial step in our efforts to acquire all of the issued and outstanding stock of GN. In May 2020 we agreed to acquire an additional 3,671,597 shares of GN common stock in exchange for an aggregate of 5,507,400 shares of our Common Stock. We presently own 7,608,097 shares of GN common stock which we believe, based on information provided by the management of GN, equals approximately 10% of the total issued and outstanding shares of GN common stock. Additionally, we own Warrants to purchase an additional 2,500,000 shares of GN common stock with each Warrant having an exercise price of CAD$1.00 per share. We intend to continue to acquire the common stock of GN in one or multiple additional transactions.
 
GN owns a 60,000 square foot cannabis cultivation and grow facility located on 38 acres in Stevensville, Ontario, Canada. Because we are minority shareholders of GN and GN is a privately held company, we cannot confirm that the information we currently have on their operations is complete or fully reliable. We have been verbally advised that, once completed, GN estimates annual total production capacity from the Stevensville facility of up to 12,500 kilograms of cannabis. GN believes the Stevensville facility to be complete, and GN’s subsidiary, 9869247 Canada Limited, received a license to cultivate from the Canadian Ministry of Health on July 5, 2019. GN has commenced cultivation activities and began generating revenues during the calendar year of 2020. Additionally, it is our current understanding that GN intends to increase cannabis production by building additional cannabis cultivation facilities on the excess land presently owned adjacent to the existing Stevensville facility, provided that additional funding can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. GN does not have any firm commitment to provide any of the funds necessary for expansion as of the date of this Report. We cannot state any definitive information concerning Great Northern because it is a privately held Canadian company who is keeping their business activities confidential. We expect that we will obtain additional information on the business activities of GN once we renew discussions to acquire additional interests and can perform our due diligence.
 
Growth by Acquisition
 
We also plan to grow through the acquisition of related, complementary businesses. In doing so we expect to increase revenues and profits by providing a broader range of services in vertical markets which are consolidated under one parent, thus realizing synergies between the brands to increase sales on multiple fronts; reducing overhead costs by streamlining operations; and eliminating duplicitous efforts and costs. There are no assurances that we will increase profitability if we are successful in acquiring other synergistic companies.

Management continues to seek out and evaluate related, complementary businesses for acquisition. The integrity and reputation of any potential acquisition candidate will first be thoroughly reviewed to ensure it meets with management’s standards. Once targeted as a potential acquisition candidate, we will enter into negotiations with the potential candidate and commence due diligence evaluation, including its financial statements, cash flow, debt, location and other material aspects of the candidate’s business. It is our intention to utilize the issuance of our securities as part of the consideration that we will pay for these proposed acquisitions. If we are successful in our attempts to acquire synergistic companies utilizing our securities as part or all of the consideration to be paid, our current shareholders will incur dilution.
 
In implementing a structure for a particular acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business.
 
As part of our investigation, our officers and directors will meet personally with management and key personnel, may visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis of verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of our limited financial resources and management expertise. The manner in which we participate in an acquisition will depend on the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs, and desires of the parties, the management of the acquisition candidate and our relative negotiation strength.
 
We will participate in an acquisition only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require some specific representations and warranties by all of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties prior to and after such closing, will outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with our attorneys and accountants, will set forth remedies on default and will include miscellaneous other terms.
 
Depending upon the nature of the acquisition, including the financial condition of the acquisition company, as a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “34 Act”), it may be necessary for such acquisition candidate to provide independent audited financial statements. If so required, we will not acquire any entity which cannot provide independent audited financial statements within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within time parameters necessary to ensure our compliance with the requirements of the 34 Act, or if the audited financial statements provided do not conform to the representations made by the candidate to be acquired in the closing documents, the closing documents will provide that the proposed transaction will be voidable, at the discretion of our present management. If such transaction is voided, the agreement will also contain a provision providing for the acquisition entity to reimburse us for all costs associated with the proposed transaction.
 
We are presently in discussion with other companies operating in the cannabis industry regarding a potential acquisition. However, there can be no assurance we will be successful consummating any additional acquisitions in the future, nor can there be any assurance we will have access available to equity and debt financing required to consummate any transaction in the future.
 
For a complete description of our business, financial condition, results of operations and other important information, we refer you to our filings with the SEC that are incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021. For instructions on how to find copies of these documents, see the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information”.

Employees
 
We currently employ four (4) employees, including our current officers and a Director of Finance.
 
We anticipate that we will retain additional employees as we develop our existing projects and close additional acquisitions in the future, of which there is no assurance. We believe that there are a sufficient number of potential qualified employees available. No employee is a member of any union. We believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory.
Competition
 
We are competing with other companies, both publicly held and private, who are also seeking to acquire or otherwise consolidate with an existing Canadian cannabis business. Many of our competitors have greater resources, both financial and otherwise, than the resources presently available to us.
Intellectual Property
 
We currently do not hold any patents or patent applications.
 
Government Regulation
 
It is our intention to continue to emphasize the cannabis industry in our search for business opportunities, specifically in Canada but are also currently considering opportunities in the United States in states that have approved cannabis legalization. However, as of the date of this Report cannabis is still considered a Schedule 1 controlled substance under US federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.”
 
If the Federal Government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in any state in which we own an interest in a cannabis operation, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine. Any such change in the Federal Government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us if we are able to acquire or develop a cannabis related operation in the US. If so, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal or state governments.
 
As of the date of this Report, 11 states and the District of Columbia have legalized adult use cannabis. There are 23 other states where medical marijuana has been legalized. The state laws are in conflict with the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level.
 
Previously, the Obama administration took the position that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. The Trump administration has revised this policy. Specifically, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) vacated the Cole Memorandum in favor of deferral of any enforcement of federal regulation to the individual states. However, certain other protections remain in place via budgetary element embedment (Rohrabacher-Farr amendment now referred to as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment), which limits funding of any enforcement of anti-cannabis legislation. The Department of Justice has stated that it will continue to enforce the Controlled Substance Act with respect to marijuana to prevent:
 

· | the distribution of marijuana to minors;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels receiving revenue from the sale of marijuana;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law to other states;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6
-


· | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | driving while impaired and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the growing of marijuana on public lands; and
--+----------------------------------------------


· | marijuana possession or use on federal property.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 
Since the use of marijuana is illegal under federal law, federally chartered banks will not accept for deposit funds from businesses involved with marijuana. Consequently, businesses involved in the marijuana industry often have trouble finding a bank willing to accept their business. The inability to open bank accounts may make it difficult for us to operate. There does appears to be recent movement to allow state-chartered banks and credit unions to provide banking to the industry, but as of the date of this Report there are only nominal entities that have been formed that offer these services.
 
Although cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical use is permitted in many states, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to implement our business plan in the US and could expose us and our management to potential criminal liability and subject our properties to civil forfeiture. Though the cultivation and distribution of marijuana remains illegal under federal law, H.R. 83, enacted by Congress on December 16, 2014, provides that none of the funds made available to the DOJ pursuant to the 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act may be used to prevent states from implementing their own laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana. However, state laws do not supersede the prohibitions set forth in the federal drug laws.
 
Canadian Regulations
 
Summary of the Cannabis Act
 
On October 17, 2018, the Cannabis Act (Canada) (the “Cannabis Act”) and the Cannabis Regulations (Canada) (the “Cannabis Regulations”) came into force as law with the effect of legalizing adult recreational use of cannabis across Canada. The Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations incorporate the Access to Cannabis for Medical for Medical Purposes Regulations (the “ACMPR”), which came into force in Canada on August 24, 2016 and were previously made under the CDSA (as defined herein). New Industrial Hemp Regulations, SOR 2018-145 were also made under the Cannabis Act, which replaced the Industrial Hemp Regulations that were previously made under the CDSA.
 
When the Cannabis Act came into force, cannabis was removed from Schedule II to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (Canada) (the “CDSA”). Prior to the Cannabis Act coming into force, the ACMPR permitted access to cannabis for medical purposes for Canadians who had been authorized to use cannabis by their health care practitioner. The ACMPR replaced the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (Canada) (the “MMPR”), which was implemented in June 2013. The MMPR replaced the Marihuana Medical Access Regulations (Canada) (the “MMAR”), which was implemented in 2001. Like the ACMPR, the MMPR and MMAR were both promulgated under the CDSA and represent initial steps in the Government of Canada’s regulation of medical cannabis and eventual legalization and regulation of adult-use recreational cannabis.
 
The Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations permit the recreational use of cannabis by adults and regulate the production, distribution, promotion and sale of cannabis products (as defined therein) in Canada, for both recreational and medical purposes. Under the Cannabis Regulations, Canadians who are authorized by their health care practitioner to use medical cannabis have the option of purchasing cannabis from one of the producers licensed by Health Canada and are also able to register with Health Canada to produce a limited amount of cannabis for their own medical purposes or to designate an individual who is registered with Health Canada to produce cannabis on their behalf for personal medical purposes.

Pursuant to the Cannabis Act, and subject to provincial regulations, individuals over the age of 18 are able to purchase cannabis products from authorized retailers and are able to legally possess up to 30 grams of dried cannabis, or the equivalent amount. As of the date of this Prospectus, the permitted classes of cannabis that an authorized person may sell include: dried cannabis, cannabis oil, fresh cannabis, cannabis plants, cannabis plant seeds, edible cannabis, cannabis extracts and cannabis topicals. The Cannabis Act also permits households to grow a maximum of four cannabis plants. This limit applies regardless of the number of adults that reside in the household. In addition, the Cannabis Act provides provincial and territorial governments the authority to prescribe regulations regarding use, retail and distribution, as well as the ability to alter some of the existing baseline requirements of the Cannabis Act, such as increasing the minimum age for purchase and consumption and setting rules around promotion of cannabis products within the province or territory.
 
The Cannabis Regulations, among other things, set out requirements relating to licensing, including key personnel and security requirements; good production practices; cannabis products; packaging and labelling; and access to cannabis for medical purposes. They are summarized below.
 
Licenses
 
The Cannabis Regulations establish six classes of licenses under the Cannabis Act: cultivation; processing; analytical testing; sale to individual clients for medical purposes; research; and cannabis drug production. It also provides for subclasses of cultivation (standard cultivation, micro-cultivation and nursery) and processing (standard processing and micro-processing).
Key Personnel and Security Clearances
 
The Cannabis Regulations require that license holders retain certain key personnel, depending on the class of license. Holders of a license for cultivation, processing and sale must retain a responsible person (who serves as the main point of contact with Health Canada) and head of security. Holders of a license for cultivation must also retain a master grower, and holders of a license for processing must retain a quality assurance person.
 
The Cannabis Regulations require a valid security clearance issued by the Minister (as defined in the Cannabis Act) for certain people associated with cannabis licensees. Security clearances must be held by directors, officers, individuals who exercise, or are in a position to exercise, direct control over a corporate licensee, directors and officers of any corporation that exercises, or is in a position to exercise, direct control over a corporate licensee and the key personnel noted above (responsible person, head of security, master grower and quality assurance person) and any other individuals identified by the Minister. The Minister may refuse to grant security clearances at its discretion to individuals or associations, such as those involved in organized crime or individuals with prior convictions for, or an association with, drug trafficking, corruption or violent offences (individuals with histories of non-violent, lower-risk criminal activity, for example, simple possession of cannabis, or small-scale cultivation of cannabis plants are not precluded from participating in the legal cannabis industry).
 
Good Production Practices and Cannabis Products
 
Part 5 of the Cannabis Regulations establishes the good production practices which must be met prior to the sale, distribution or export of cannabis, and Part 6 of the Cannabis Regulations establishes rules for cannabis products, including permitted/prohibited ingredients and amounts of THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol). These require that cannabis and anything that will be used as an ingredient must be produced, packaged, labelled, distributed, stored, sampled and tested in accordance with standard operating procedures that are designed to ensure that those activities are conducted in accordance with the applicable requirements of Parts 5 (Good Production Practices) and Part 6 (Cannabis Products).
 
The good production practices requirements relate to storage, distribution, the design and construction of buildings, filtration and ventilation systems, water supply, lighting, equipment, sanitation programs and testing.

-

 

Part 6 of the Cannabis Regulations sets standards for the safe consumption of cannabis products, in respect of being free from biological and chemical contaminants and also limits the amounts of THC in cannabis products.
 
Cannabis Tracking System
 
Under the Cannabis Act, the Minister established and maintains a national cannabis tacking system, which is called The Cannabis Tracking and Licensing System (the “CTLS”). The CTLS provides an online secure platform for filing applications for licenses and security clearances under the Cannabis Regulations. Through the cannabis supply chain, the CTLS also tracks cannabis from federal cannabis license holders to individual medical clients, or from federal cannabis license holders to recreational market channels. The tracking function of the CTLS serves to limit the diversion of cannabis into, and out of, the regulated medical and recreational markets.
Promotion, Packaging and Labelling
 
The Cannabis Act establishes strict prohibitions on the promotion of cannabis, and the Cannabis Regulations establish rules around plain packaging and labelling. Among other things, it is prohibited to promote cannabis in a way that could be appealing to young people, by way of a testimonial or endorsement or through depiction of a person, character or animal, whether real or fictional; or in a manner associated with a “lifestyle”. The Cannabis Regulations establish rules around packaging and labelling to promote informed consumer choice, allow for the safe handling and transportation of cannabis products, ensure child-proofing on containers and reducing the appeal of cannabis to youth. The size and color of packaging, logos, names and other brand elements is restricted. Cannabis package labels must include specific information, such as: (i) product source information, including the class of cannabis and the name, phone number and email of the processor; (ii) a mandatory health warning, rotating between Heath Canada’s list of standard health warnings; (iii) the Health Canada standardized cannabis symbol; and (iv) information specifying THC and Cannabidiol content.
Cannabis for Medical Purposes
 
The medical cannabis regulatory framework shifted from the ACMPR made under the CDSA to the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations. Under Part 14 of the Cannabis Regulations, there are three options available to an individual who has received authorization from his/her healthcare practitioner to use cannabis for medical purposes: (i) by registering with a holder of a license to sell for medical purposes; (ii) by registering with Health Canada for the production of a limited amount of cannabis for their own medical purposes; or (iii) by designating a third party to produce cannabis for them. With respect to (ii) and (iii), the starting materials for the production of cannabis, such as cannabis plants or seeds, must be obtained from medical sales license holders.
Provincial and Territorial Regulatory Framework
 
The governments of every Canadian province and territory have implemented regulatory regimes for the use, distribution and sale of cannabis products for recreational purposes within their jurisdiction. The only provinces with restrictions on classes of cannabis that may be sold in the recreational markets are Québec and Manitoba, where plants and seeds are not sold because personal cultivation for recreational purposes is prohibited in those two provinces. In addition, as of the date of this Prospectus, some provinces are considering whether or not to allow cannabis vape products to be sold, including Newfoundland and Labrador.
 
Regardless of the specific provincial retail framework, all cannabis products for the recreational cannabis market must be supplied by federally licensed cultivators (plants and seeds only) and processors (all other allowable classes of cannabis – currently dried cannabis, cannabis oil, cannabis edibles, cannabis extracts and cannabis topicals). In most provinces and territories, a liquor or cannabis authority operated by the province serves as a wholesaler, with retailers purchasing cannabis products from the liquor or cannabis authority or from provincially licensed distributors. The wholesalers, in turn, acquire the cannabis products from federally licensed cultivators and processors.

Summary of the Cannabis Act
 
On October 17, 2019, the Cannabis Act came into force as law with the effect of legalizing adult recreational use of cannabis across Canada. The Cannabis Act replaced the ACMPR and the IHR, both of which came into force under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (Canada) (the “CDSA”), which previously permitted access to cannabis for medical purposes for only those Canadians who had been authorized to use cannabis by their health care practitioner. The ACMPR replaced the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (Canada) (the “MMPR”), which was implemented in June 2013. The MMPR replaced the Marihuana Medical Access Regulations (Canada) (the “MMAR”) which was implemented in 2001. The MMPR and MMAR were initial steps in the Government of Canada’s legislative path towards the eventual legalization and regulating recreational and medical cannabis.
 
The Cannabis Act permits the recreational adult use of cannabis and regulates the production, distribution and sale of cannabis and related oil extracts in Canada, for both recreational and medical purposes. Under the Cannabis Act, Canadians who are authorized by their health care practitioner to use medical cannabis have the option of purchasing cannabis from one of the producers licensed by Health Canada and are also able to register with Health Canada to produce a limited amount of cannabis for their own medical purposes or to designate an individual who is registered with Health Canada to produce cannabis on their behalf for personal medical purposes.
 
Pursuant to the Cannabis Act, subject to provincial regulations, individuals over the age of 18 are be able to purchase fresh cannabis, dried cannabis, cannabis oil, and cannabis plants or seeds and are able to legally possess up to 30 grams of dried cannabis, or the equivalent amount in fresh cannabis or cannabis oil. The Cannabis Act also permits households to grow a maximum of four cannabis plants. This limit applies regardless of the number of adults that reside in the household. In addition, the Cannabis Act provides provincial and municipal governments the authority to prescribe regulations regarding retail and distribution, as well as the ability to alter some of the existing baseline requirements of the Cannabis Act, such as increasing the minimum age for purchase and consumption.
 
Provincial and territorial governments in Canada have made varying announcements on the proposed regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for adult-use purposes. For example, Québec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Yukon and the Northwest Territories have chosen the government-regulated model for distribution, whereas Saskatchewan and Newfoundland & Labrador have opted for a private sector approach. Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, Nunavut and British Columbia have announced plans to pursue a hybrid approach of public and private sale and distribution.
 
In connection with the new framework for regulating cannabis in Canada, the Federal Government has introduced new penalties under the Criminal Code (Canada), including penalties for the illegal sale of cannabis, possession of cannabis over the prescribed limit, production of cannabis beyond personal cultivation limits, taking cannabis across the Canadian border, giving or selling cannabis to a youth and involving a youth to commit a cannabis-related offence.
 
On July 11, 2019, the Federal Government published regulations in the Canada Gazette to support the Cannabis Act, including the Cannabis Regulations, the new Industrial Hemp Regulations, along with proposed amendments to the Narcotic Control Regulations and certain regulations under the Food and Drugs Act (Canada). The Industrial Hemp Regulations and the Cannabis Regulations, among other things, outline the rules for the legal cultivation, processing, research, analytical testing, distribution, sale, importation and exportation of cannabis and hemp in Canada, including the various classes of licenses that can be granted, and set standards for cannabis and hemp products. The Industrial Hemp Regulations and the Cannabis Regulations include strict specifications for the plain packaging and labeling and analytical testing of all cannabis products as well as stringent physical and personnel security requirements for all federally licensed production sites. The Industrial Hemp Regulations and the Cannabis Regulations also maintain a distinct system for access to cannabis. With the Cannabis Act now in force, cannabis has ceased to be regulated under the CDSA and is instead regulated under the Cannabis Act, and both the ACMPR and the IHR have been repealed effective October 17, 2019.

Security Clearances
 
The Cannabis Regulations require that certain people associated with cannabis licensees, including individuals occupying a “key position” directors, officers, large shareholders and individuals identified by the Minister of Health, must hold a valid security clearance issued by the Minister of Health. Officers and directors of a parent corporation must be security cleared.

Under the Cannabis Regulations, the Minister of Health may refuse to grant security clearances to individuals with associations to organized crime or with past convictions for, or an association with, drug trafficking, corruption or violent offenses. Individuals who have histories of nonviolent, lower-risk criminal activity (for example, simple possession of cannabis, or small-scale cultivation of cannabis plants) are not precluded from participating in the legal cannabis industry, and the grant of security clearance to such individuals is at the discretion of the Minister of Health and such applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
 
Cannabis Tracking System
 
Under the Cannabis Act, the Minister of Health is authorized to establish and maintain a national cannabis tracking system. The Cannabis Regulations set out a national cannabis tracking system to track cannabis throughout the supply chain to help prevent diversion of cannabis into, and out of, the illicit market. The Cannabis Regulations also provides the Minister of Health with the authority to make a ministerial order that would require certain persons named in such order to report specific information about their authorized activities with cannabis, in the form and manner specified by the Minister of Health.
Cannabis Products
 
The Cannabis Regulations set out the requirements for the sale of cannabis products at the retail level permit the sale of dried cannabis, cannabis oil, fresh cannabis, cannabis plants, and cannabis seeds, including in such forms as “pre-rolled” and in capsules. The THC content and serving size of cannabis products is limited by the Cannabis Regulations. The sale of edibles containing cannabis and cannabis concentrates was legalized in the fall of 2019.
Description of Canadian Licenses and Licensing Requirements
 
Laws and regulations affecting the medical marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations. Local, state and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. It is also possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business. These ever-changing regulations could even affect federal tax policies that may make it difficult to claim tax deductions on our returns. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business.
