ITEM 1. Business
Overview
Nutanix, Inc. ("we," "us," "our" or "Nutanix") provides a leading enterprise cloud platform that powers many of the world’s business applications and end user services by providing software solutions that digitize traditional silos of enterprise computing. With the advent of cloud as a mainstream consumption paradigm, enterprises are increasingly keen to re-platform existing IT environments with a hybrid cloud architecture that allows business to utilize a private cloud, leverage public cloud where applicable, and distribute this hybrid cloud architecture to the edge where their business engages with devices and users. Our solution allows our customers to virtualize various clouds - private, public, edge - into one seamless cloud enabling enterprises to choose the right cloud for the right application. Our enterprise cloud platform converges compute, virtualization, storage, networking, desktop, governance and security services in one integrated, simple to consume solution delivered through software. Further, our software and software as a service ("SaaS") solutions allow enterprises to simplify the complexities of a multi-cloud environment with automation, cost governance and compliance. We underpin the platform with unique web-scale engineering and one-click operational simplicity that powers any scale deployment while giving customers the freedom of choice across various hardware platforms, across various virtualization solutions and across major public cloud providers. 
Our Enterprise Cloud Platform
Our enterprise cloud platform is based on powerful distributed systems architecture that converge compute, virtualization, storage, networking and security resources into one integrated solution. Our platform, which includes the software features, products and services described below, melds on-premise, public and edge cloud operating infrastructures. 
Core Infrastructure Platform. Acropolis is the foundation of our platform. It starts with hyperconvergence, then adds native virtualization, enterprise storage, virtual networking, and platform services, including application mobility and security, in a single turnkey platform. It is an open platform designed to address all needs for a wide range of workloads that can be run at nearly any scale. Acropolis is comprised of four foundational components:

• | Virtualization: Acropolis supports all major virtualization solutions, but also includes our native built-in Acropolis Hypervisor ("AHV"). AHV is based on widely used open source hypervisor technology, known as Linux KVM, and includes enterprise-grade security, self-healing capabilities and robust virtual machine ("VM"), management. AHV is completely managed via Nutanix Prism to streamline the provisioning, placing and managing of VMs.


• | Enterprise Storage Capabilities: Building on a distributed data fabric, Acropolis enables robust enterprise storage services across multiple storage protocols and hypervisors. Enterprise storage capabilities include performance acceleration capabilities, such as caching, data tiering and data locality, and storage optimization, such as deduplication, compression and erasure coding, along with data protection and disaster recovery features. Acropolis also includes Nutanix Buckets, which provides built-in support for container-based applications controlled via Kubernetes and Docker.


• | Platform Services: Acropolis delivers a comprehensive set of platform services that enables IT organizations to consolidate nearly all of their workloads on the Nutanix platform and manage them centrally. These services include Nutanix Volume, a native scale-out block storage solution that enables enterprise applications running on external servers to leverage the Nutanix data fabric, and Acropolis File Services, now named Nutanix Files, a native file storage solution for unstructured data that allows our customers to easily scale their file-based storage for all applications and users.


• | Networking Services: Nutanix Flow, which is supported by AHV, provides application-centric network and policy management and allows users to deploy microsegmentation to secure individual applications or groups of applications, without any changes to the existing network.

Management. Prism is our end-to-end consumer-grade management plane providing management and analytics across our software products and services. It delivers integrated virtualization and infrastructure management, robust operational analytics, self-service capabilities and one-click administration. Prism allows routine IT operations that are typically manual and cumbersome to be fully automated or completed with just one click, including capacity planning, provisioning of new applications and resources, troubleshooting and software upgrades. With innovative built-in machine intelligence technology, Prism provides capacity runway projections and capacity optimization recommendations to ensure just the right amount of resources are provisioned to support the applications running on the platform. Users can then precisely track infrastructure utilization across a distributed environment and add or remove nodes to any cluster in minutes. Prism enables efficient management of enterprise-wide deployments by serving as a central administration point to manage multiple clusters and hypervisors within a datacenter or across multiple sites. Prism is also built using a distributed, scale-out architecture, and software updates and patches can be executed non-disruptively without requiring the cluster to be brought offline. Prism also offers a self-service portal that enables developers and line-of-business owners to provision services, as well as a broad set of APIs for integration with third-party products.
Automation and Orchestration. Nutanix Calm adds native application orchestration, automation, and lifecycle management to our enterprise cloud platform. Nutanix Calm fully automates the provisioning, scaling and deletion of applications using pre-integrated blueprints that simplifies management of applications in both private and public clouds. IT teams can customize and publish blueprints for internal consumption across groups within their company, allowing for streamlining and sharing of operational expertise. The Nutanix Marketplace also allows application developers to publish blueprints for consumption by end users so new applications can quickly be introduced. 
Cloud and Platform Services. We are extending our platform to provide new products and services that further extend our hybrid cloud vision across the entire software stack. Beam is our multi-cloud optimization service that gives organizations deep visibility into, and analytics on, their cloud consumption patterns, along with one-click cost optimization across cloud environments. Frame, a new offering we recently acquired, provides our customers with a desktop-as-a-service offering that combines the consumer-grade simplicity and web-scale design of cloud applications with the functionality of traditional virtual desktop applications. 
We also continue to develop additional products and services, including Nutanix Xi Cloud Services and Nutanix Era. Nutanix Xi Cloud Services will allow IT leaders to leverage Nutanix software as a native cloud-delivered service, initially for disaster recovery through Nutanix Leap, and is expected to be available in late calendar year 2018. Nutanix Era automates database provisioning and lifecycle management and will initially provide copy data management services allowing customers to provision, clone, refresh and restore copies of production data. Nutanix Era is also expected to be available in late calendar year 2018.
Delivery of Our Solutions
Customers have the choice to buy our enterprise cloud software and deploy the software on a variety of qualified hardware platforms or to purchase the software pre-installed onto hardware through one of our original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") partners or other channel partners, including on the Nutanix-branded NX hardware line. Our OEM partners, Dell Technologies ("Dell"), Lenovo Group Ltd. ("Lenovo"), International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM") and Fujitsu Technology Solutions GmbH ("Fujitsu"), license our software and package it with their hardware into the Dell XC Series, Lenovo Converged HX Series, IBM CS Series and Fujitsu XF Series appliances, respectively. Super Micro Computer, Inc. ("Super Micro") and Flextronics Systems Limited ("Flextronics") license our software and package it with our Nutanix-branded NX appliances. Our OEM partners offer these appliances in a range of configurations and also sell associated support offerings, which we jointly support. 
We also deliver certain of our cloud and platform solutions, such as Beam and Frame, and are continuing to develop additional cloud services, such as Nutanix Xi Cloud Services and Nutanix Era, all of which are intended to be delivered as a hosted service which can be purchased on a subscription basis.

Our Support Programs
We have a customer support organization that offers varying levels of support to our customers based on their needs. All support customers receive round-the-clock support service from our global support centers which are staffed by our employees, as well as software entitlements to receive upgrades and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis. We also offer premium support programs through our technical account managers and designated support engineers.
Professional Services: We provide consulting and implementation services to customers through our professional services team. We typically provide these services at the time of initial installation to help the customer with configuration and implementation. 
Our End Customers
Our solution addresses a broad range of workloads, including "tier-one" enterprise applications, databases, virtual desktop infrastructure ("VDI"), unified communications and big data analytics. As a result, we have end customers across a broad range of industries, including automotive, consumer goods, education, energy, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, media, public sector, retail, technology and telecommunications, some of whom are service providers who utilize our platform to provide a variety of cloud-based services to their customers. We had a broad and diverse base of over 10,600 end customers as of July 31, 2018, including many Global 2000 enterprises. We define the number of end customers as the number of end customers for which we have received an order by the last day of the period indicated. Our end customer count does not include partners to which we have sold products for their own demonstration purposes. A single organization or customer may represent multiple end customers for separate divisions, segments or subsidiaries.
Our platform is primarily sold through channel partners, including distributors and resellers, thus the distributor is typically considered the direct purchaser in a transaction. Carahsoft Technology Corp., a distributor to our end customers, represented 14%, 9% and 10% of our total revenue for fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Promark Technology Inc., another distributor to our end customers, represented 18%, 19% and 20% of our total revenue for fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.
Growth Strategy
Key elements of our growth strategy include:

• | Continually innovate and maintain technology leadership. Since inception, we have rapidly innovated from supporting limited applications and a single hypervisor to a full platform that is designed to support a wide variety of workloads. We intend to continue to invest heavily in developing our enterprise platform with new features, services and products to expand our market opportunity.


• | Invest to acquire new end customers. We completed our first end customer sale in October 2011 and have since grown to over 10,600 end customers. We intend to grow our base of end customers by increasing our investment in sales and marketing, leveraging our network of channel partners and OEMs, furthering our international expansion and extending our enterprise cloud platform to address new customer segments. One area of continued focus is expanding our position within the Global 2000.


• | Continue to drive follow-on sales to existing end customers. Our end customers typically deploy our technology initially for a specific workload. Our sales teams and channel partners then seek to systematically target follow-on sales opportunities to drive purchases of additional appliances and higher tier software editions. This land and expand strategy enables us to quickly expand our footprint within our existing end customer base from follow-on orders that in the aggregate are often multiples of the initial order.


• | Deepen engagement with current channel and OEM partners and establish additional routes to market to enhance sales leverage. We have established meaningful channel partnerships globally and have driven strong engagement and initial commercial success with several major resellers and distributors. We believe that our OEM relationships can augment our routes to market to accelerate our growth and that there is a significant opportunity to grow our sales with our channel partners and OEMs. We intend to attract and engage new channel and OEM partners around the globe. while also selling our standalone software on qualified servers to maximize the availability of our solution for our customers.

• | Invest in rapid growth while remaining focused on our overall financial health. We intend to continue investing in our rapid growth, while balancing such growth against our operating cash flow. By maintaining this balance, we believe we can drive toward our high growth potential without sacrificing our overall financial health.

Sales and Marketing
Sales. We primarily engage our end customers through our global sales force who directly interact with key IT decision makers while also providing sales development, opportunity qualification and support to our channel partners. We have established relationships with our channel partners, who represent many of the key resellers and distributors of datacenter infrastructure software and systems in each of the geographic regions where we operate. We also engage our end customers through our OEM partners, which license our software and package it with their hardware, and sell through their direct sales forces and channel partners.
Technology Alliances. We have developed relationships with a number of leading technology companies that help us deliver world-class solutions to our customers. Through our Elevate Technology Alliance Partner Program, our developer, application, hardware and infrastructure partners get access to resources that allow them to validate and integrate their products with Nutanix solutions and engage in joint sales training and enablement. In addition, we work closely with our technology partners through co-marketing and lead-generation activities in an effort to broaden our marketing reach and help us win new customers and retain existing ones.
Marketing. Our channel partners have joined our integrated partner program, the Nutanix Partner Network, which provides market development funds, preferred pricing through deal registration, sales enablement and product training, innovative marketing campaigns and dedicated account support. We also coordinate with our OEM partners on joint marketing activities. We supplement our sales efforts with our marketing program that includes print and online advertising, corporate and third-party events, demand generation activities, social media promotions, media and analyst relations, and community programs. For example, in May 2018 we hosted our fourth annual .NEXT Conference, where almost 5,000 attendees came to learn about our current and future products and solutions. We also establish deep integration with our ecosystem of third-party technology partners and engage in joint marketing activities with them.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on improving current technology, developing new technologies in current and adjacent markets and supporting existing end customer deployments. Our research and development teams primarily consist of distributed systems software and user interface engineers. Most of our research and development team is based in San Jose, California. We also maintain research and development centers in Bangalore, India, Durham, North Carolina, Seattle, Washington and Belgrade, Serbia. We plan to dedicate significant resources to our continued research and development efforts.
Research and development expense was $116.4 million, $288.6 million and $313.8 million for fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. 
Manufacturing
We outsource the assembly of our branded NX product line to two contract manufacturers, Super Micro, and Flextronics. Super Micro and Flextronics assemble and test our NX products and they generally procure the components used in the NX product line directly from third-party suppliers. Our agreement with Super Micro expires in May 2019, and automatically renews for successive one-year periods thereafter, with the option to terminate upon each annual renewal. Our agreement with Flextronics expires in November 2020 and automatically renews for successive one-year periods thereafter, with the option to terminate upon each annual renewal. Distributors handle fulfillment and shipment for certain end customers, but do not hold inventory.
Backlog
We typically accept and ship orders within a short time frame. In general, customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty, and delivery schedules requested by customers in their purchase orders vary based upon each customer’s particular needs. As a result, we do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is a reliable indicator of future revenue.

Competition
We operate in the competitive enterprise infrastructure market and compete primarily with companies that sell software to build and operate enterprise clouds, integrated systems, and standalone storage and servers, as well as providers of public cloud infrastructure solutions. These markets are characterized by constant change and rapid innovation. Our main competitors fall into the following categories:

• | software providers, such as Red Hat, Inc. and VMware, Inc. ("VMware"), that offer a broad range of virtualization, infrastructure and management products to build and operate enterprise clouds;


• | traditional IT systems vendors, such as Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco"), Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company ("HPE"), Hitachi Data Systems ("Hitachi"), IBM, and Lenovo, that offer integrated systems that include bundles of servers, storage and networking solutions, as well as a broad range of standalone server and storage products;


• | traditional storage array vendors, such as Dell, Hitachi, and NetApp, Inc. ("NetApp"), which typically sell centralized storage products; and


• | providers of public cloud infrastructure and services, such as Amazon.com, Inc., Google Inc., and Microsoft Corporation.

In addition, we compete against vendors of hyperconverged infrastructure and software-defined storage products, such as Cisco, Dell, HPE, VMware and many smaller emerging companies. As our market grows, we expect it will continue to attract new companies as well as existing larger vendors. For example, NetApp has released a solution aimed at the hyperconverged market. Some of our competitors may expand their product offerings, acquire competing businesses, sell at lower prices, bundle with other products, provide closed technology platforms or otherwise attempt to gain a competitive advantage. For example, HPE acquired SimpliVity Corporation and Cisco acquired Springpath, Inc., both of which were emerging hyperconverged vendors, in order to bolster their own hyperconverged product lines. Furthermore, as we expand our product offerings, we may expand into new markets and we may encounter additional competitors in such markets. Additionally, as companies increasingly offer competing solutions, they may be less willing to partner with us as an OEM or otherwise.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:

• | product features and capabilities;


• | system scalability, performance and resiliency;


• | management and operations, including provisioning, analytics, automation and upgrades;


• | total cost of ownership over the lifetime of the technology;


• | product interoperability with third-party applications, infrastructure software, infrastructure systems and public clouds;


• | application mobility across disparate silos of enterprise computing, including public and private cloud infrastructure; and


• | complete customer experience, including usability, support and professional services.

We believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on these factors. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, broader distribution, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect and use our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and employee nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of July 31, 2018, we had 66 United States patents that have been issued or allowed and 297 patent applications pending in the United States. Our issued patents expire between 2031 and 2037. We also leverage open source software in some of our products.

See Item 1A, "Risk Factors," for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property.
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters are located in San Jose, California where, under lease agreements that expire through April 2024, we currently lease approximately 326,000 square feet of space. We also maintain offices in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. We lease all of our facilities and do not own any real property. We expect to add facilities as we grow our employee base and expand geographically. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future, and that, should it be needed, suitable additional space will be available to accommodate the expansion of our operations.
Employees
We had approximately 4,000 employees worldwide as of July 31, 2018. None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor organization or is a party to any collective bargaining arrangement. In certain of the European countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements in relation to the establishment of works councils. We are often required to consult and seek the consent or advice of these works councils. We have never had a work stoppage and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
