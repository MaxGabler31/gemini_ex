Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Company Overview
 We are a Maryland corporation engaged in owning and leasing rate-regulated assets in Texas and headquartered in Dallas, Texas. We are structured as a REIT and lease our regulated assets to Sharyland, a Texas-based regulated electric utility, pursuant to leases between Sharyland and our subsidiary, Sharyland Distribution & Transmission Services, L.L.C. (SDTS), a Texas-based regulated electric utility. Sharyland delivers electric service to other utilities and collects revenues through PUCT-approved rates.
 Our business originated in the late 1990s when members of the Hunt family founded Sharyland, the first investor owned utility created in the United States since the 1960s. In 2007, we obtained a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) confirming that our transmission and distribution assets could constitute real estate assets under applicable REIT rules. In 2008, the PUCT approved a restructuring that allowed us to utilize our REIT structure (2008 Restructuring Order). In 2010, InfraREIT, L.L.C. was formed as a REIT, holding all its assets through InfraREIT Partners, LP (Operating Partnership). We completed our initial public offering (IPO) and a series of reorganization transactions in 2015. In November 2017, SDTS exchanged all of its retail distribution assets for a group of transmission assets owned by Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC (Oncor) that are located near Wichita Falls, Abilene and Brownwood, Texas (2017 Asset Exchange Transaction). As a result, all of our current assets are comprised of transmission and wholesale distribution assets.
 InfraREIT, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation in 2001 and converted into a Maryland corporation in 2014. Hunt Utility Services, LLC (Hunt Manager) manages our day-to-day business, subject to oversight from our board of directors. We conduct our business through a traditional umbrella partnership REIT (UPREIT) in which our properties are owned by the Operating Partnership or direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. All our assets are held by and all our business activities are conducted through the Operating Partnership, either directly or through its subsidiaries. InfraREIT is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and owns approximately 72.5% of the limited partnership units (OP Units) as of February 20, 2019. The remaining OP Units are held by the Operating Partnership’s limited partners, including affiliates and current or former employees of Hunt Consolidated, Inc. (HCI) and members of our board of directors. Subject to the terms of the partnership agreement, OP Units held by the limited partners may be redeemed for cash or, at our option, exchanged for shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis.
 Our assets are located in the Texas Panhandle; near Wichita Falls, Abilene and Brownwood; in the Permian Basin; and in South Texas. We were formed in 2009 and have grown our rate base from approximately $60 million as of December 31, 2009 to approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2018.
 Sale and Asset Exchange
 On October 18, 2018, InfraREIT and the Operating Partnership entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Oncor for $21.00 per share or OP Unit, as applicable, in cash, valued at approximately $1.275 billion, plus the assumption of our net debt of approximately $950 million as of December 31, 2018.
 As a condition to Oncor’s acquisition of us, SDTS and Oncor also signed a definitive agreement with Sharyland to exchange, immediately prior to Oncor’s acquisition, SDTS’s South Texas assets for certain assets owned by Sharyland. SDTS and Sharyland have agreed to terminate their existing leases in connection with the asset exchange.
 The asset exchange with Sharyland and merger with Oncor are mutually dependent on one another, and neither will become effective without the closing of the other. See Pending Corporate Transactions below for additional information.

Our Regulated Assets
 Our regulated assets consist of approximately 1,520 circuit miles of transmission lines, substations, a 300-megawatt high-voltage DC Tie between Texas and Mexico (Railroad DC Tie) and a transmission operations center. Approximately 68% of our net assets as of December 31, 2018 constitute transmission lines that were constructed as part of the CREZ initiative, which was originated by the Texas Legislature in 2005 and carried out by the PUCT, to meet the state’s goals regarding renewable energy capacity by delivering renewable energy to end use consumers in the most cost-effective manner.
 The following map shows the location of our assets as of December 31, 2018:
 

Expected Capital Expenditures
 We expect to fund capital expenditures for Footprint Projects during the calendar years 2019 through 2020 in the range of $30 million to $70 million. For additional information related to our estimated Footprint Projects capital expenditures, see Capital Expenditures under the caption Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7., Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 Our Revenue Model
 We lease our regulated assets to Sharyland, which makes lease payments to us consisting of base and percentage rent. To support its lease payments to us, Sharyland delivers electric service to other utilities and collects revenues through PUCT-approved rates. Under the terms of our leases, Sharyland is responsible for the maintenance and operation of our assets, including repairs, maintenance, insurance and taxes (other than income taxes and REIT excise taxes), payment of all property-related expenses associated with our assets and construction of Footprint Projects. Sharyland is also primarily responsible for regulatory compliance and reporting requirements related to our assets.

Provisions of Our Leases
 The following summarizes the material terms of our leases.
 Rental Rates
 All of our current revenue is comprised of rental payments from Sharyland under leases and lease supplements that were negotiated at various times between 2010 and 2018. Lease supplements are exhibits to our leases that include the economics of the lease obligations that Sharyland owes us. We and Sharyland have negotiated rent payments intended to provide us with approximately 97% of the projected regulated return on rate base investment attributable to our assets that we and Sharyland would receive if we were a fully integrated utility. See the caption Lease Revenues under Factors Expected to Affect Our Operating Results and Financial Condition included in Part II, Item 7., Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We and Sharyland have negotiated these rental rates based on the premise that we, as the owner of regulated assets, should receive most of the regulated return on our invested capital, while leaving Sharyland with a portion of the return that gives it the opportunity to operate prudently and earn a profit or suffer a loss on its operation of those assets. Our leases require us to negotiate rent payments in a manner consistent with this practice.
 Actual revenue and expenses incurred by Sharyland will be different from those expected at the time of negotiation. As a result, we and Sharyland may earn more or less than originally projected. Our leases prohibit adjustments to lease payments for the effect of differences between Sharyland’s actual and projected results.
 Our lease revenue primarily consists of base rent, but certain lease supplements contain percentage rent as well. The lease supplements for the Permian Lease, Stanton Transmission Loop Lease and assets in the CREZ Lease that were acquired from Oncor in the 2017 Asset Exchange Transaction provide only for base rent. Rent for the McAllen Lease, ERCOT Lease and assets in the CREZ Lease not acquired in the 2017 Asset Exchange Transaction is comprised primarily of base rent but also includes percentage rent. However, all of our rent with respect to the capital expenditures to be placed in service in 2019 consists only of base rent. Percentage rent under our leases is based on a percentage of Sharyland’s annual gross revenues, as defined in the applicable lease, in excess of an annual breakpoint specified in each lease, which is at least equal to the base rent under each lease. Because a utility’s rate base decreases over time, as our regulated assets depreciate, revenue under our leases will decrease over time unless we add to our existing rate base by placing additional assets in service to offset the decreases in the rent resulting from depreciation. The weighted average annual depreciation rate of our assets as of December 31, 2018 was 2.51%.
 Our leases provide that, as our rate base increases, due to Footprint Projects being placed in service, we and Sharyland will negotiate amended and restated lease supplements that will update the scheduled rent payments to include additional rent payments related to this incremental rate base. The negotiation of amended and restated lease supplements relates only to the revenue we expect to be generated from the incremental rate base subject to the negotiation and does not impact the portion of the scheduled lease payments previously negotiated with respect to assets that are already in service. However, various factors, such as a change in regulatory conditions or assumptions, could cause Sharyland’s expected lease payments on incremental rate base to be different than its lease payments to us on our existing rate base. Also, our leases provide that either party can negotiate for economics in the amended and restated lease supplements that differ from our existing leases based on factors that we determine to be appropriate at the time of the negotiation.
 Additionally, the amended and restated lease supplement process allows us to address and update a number of other matters under our leases, such as updating the amount of revenue attributable to Sharyland’s capital expenditures and related matters. Because we frequently prepare amended and restated supplements based on our and Sharyland’s expectations regarding various matters, including expected assets placed in service, our leases contain a mechanism, which we refer to as a validation, that we use to amend previously negotiated supplements in order to reflect the difference between the expected assets placed in service and the actual assets that were placed in service, placed in service dates, TCOS filing and effective dates and related matters. In no event may we use the validation process to account for differences between the expected and actual return on assets placed in service. If we and Sharyland are unable to agree on a rent supplement or a validation, the leases obligate us to submit the dispute to binding arbitration.
 Operation of Our Regulated Assets
 The leases require that Sharyland operate the regulated assets in a reasonable and prudent manner in accordance with PUCT guidelines and applicable law. Sharyland must obtain and maintain any licenses, permits or other approvals required by applicable law to operate the regulated assets under the leases.
 9

Expenditures
 Sharyland is required to provide a capital expenditure budget on a rolling three-year basis that sets forth anticipated capital expenditures related to Footprint Projects. Our capitalization policies, consistent with standard utility practices under U.S. GAAP, determine whether a particular expenditure is characterized as a Footprint Project, which we are required to fund, or a repair, which Sharyland is required to fund. Footprint Projects expenditures are capitalized and increase our net electric plant, while expenditures relating to repairs of our existing regulated assets are expensed by Sharyland.
Sharyland’s Events of Default
 Under our leases, a default will be deemed to occur upon certain events, including, subject in certain instances to applicable cure periods, (1) the failure of Sharyland to pay rent, (2) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to Sharyland, (3) Sharyland’s material breach of a representation or warranty in a lease, (4) Sharyland’s material breach of a covenant in a lease or (5) a final judgment for the payment of cash in excess of $1,000,000 rendered against Sharyland that is not bonded, stayed pending appeal or discharged within 60 days.
Remedies Upon a Default
 Upon a default under a lease, we may, at our option, exercise the following remedies, subject to any necessary approvals of the PUCT or other applicable governmental authority: (1) terminate the applicable lease agreement upon notice to Sharyland and recover any damages to which we are entitled under applicable law; (2) terminate Sharyland’s right to use our regulated assets and recover any damages to which we are entitled under applicable law; or (3) take reasonable action to cure Sharyland’s default at Sharyland’s expense.
Financial Covenants
 Sharyland is subject to certain covenants under our leases that prohibit Sharyland from incurring indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds and that otherwise obligate Sharyland to comply with certain covenants under our debt agreements.
Assignment and Subletting
 Sharyland may not assign or sublet any of our regulated assets under the leases without our prior written consent and the approval of the PUCT or other applicable governmental authority.
Indemnification
 Sharyland is required to defend, indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, obligations, liabilities, damages and costs and expenses arising from any act or omission of Sharyland with respect to (1) the operation of the regulated assets, (2) damage to the regulated assets, (3) physical injuries or death (including in connection with the operation of the regulated assets), (4) any breach of any representation or warranty or covenant or (5) any negligence, recklessness or intentional misconduct of Sharyland.
Lease Renewals or Expiration
 Our leases provide that, if we and Sharyland desire to renew a lease, we will negotiate lease terms based on our historical negotiations and the return that utilities in Texas are generally earning at the time of negotiation. If either we or Sharyland do not wish to renew a lease, we expect that our negotiations with a new third-party tenant would be based on the rate base of the assets covered by the expired lease and the rate of return expected at the time a new lease is negotiated, among other factors. In any event, because our regulated assets are rate-regulated and necessary for the transmission of electricity, we expect that they will continue to generate tariff revenue.
Regulatory Environment
 In the United States, regulated electric assets are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. State regulatory commissions generally establish utility rates based on a traditional cost-of-service basis, providing for the timely recovery of prudently incurred costs and the opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, subject to review and approval through periodic regulatory proceedings.
 10

Our regulated assets are located in ERCOT within Texas and, as a result, we are not subject to general regulation as a “public utility” under the Federal Power Act and therefore not subject to FERC jurisdiction. Instead, we are regulated by the PUCT, which has original jurisdiction over transmission and distribution rates and services in unincorporated areas and in those municipalities that have ceded original jurisdiction to the PUCT and has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review the rate and service orders and ordinances of municipalities that have not ceded original jurisdiction. Rates are established through rate case proceedings, which occur periodically and are typically initiated by the utility or the PUCT, on its own motion or on complaint by an affected stakeholder, to ensure that rates remain just and reasonable. In addition, PURA requires owners and operators of transmission facilities to provide open-access wholesale transmission services to third parties at rates and terms that are nondiscriminatory and comparable to the rates and terms of the utility’s own use of its system, and the PUCT has adopted rules implementing the state open-access requirements for all utilities that are subject to the PUCT’s jurisdiction over transmission services.
 Historical Regulation of Our Structure
 We have separated, between Sharyland and us, the assets and functionality that are typically combined under one commonly owned group in an integrated utility. We are generally responsible for financing and funding asset additions, while Sharyland is responsible for construction management, operation and maintenance of our regulated assets. Accordingly, our 2008 Restructuring Order required Sharyland and SDTS to be regulated on a combined basis, and Sharyland, as the holder of the CCN required to operate our regulated assets, historically has made all regulatory filings related to our assets with the PUCT. As part of our rate case in Docket No. 45414 (2016 Rate Case), the PUCT raised certain questions indicating that this regulatory construct might change in the future, including the potential regulation of the leases between Sharyland and SDTS as tariffs. In November 2017, the 2016 Rate Case was dismissed upon the completion of the 2017 Asset Exchange Transaction (Rate Case Dismissal), but the dismissal preserved the right of the parties to the 2016 Rate Case to address in a future proceeding all issues not mooted by the Rate Case Dismissal. Additionally, as part of the PUCT order approving the 2017 Asset Exchange Transaction, SDTS was granted a separate CCN to continue to own and lease its assets to Sharyland.
Rate Setting
 Rates are determined by an electric utility’s cost of rendering service to the public during a historical test year, adjusted for known and measurable changes, in addition to a reasonable return on invested capital. When we refer to a “rate case” or a “rate proceeding,” we are referring to formal proceedings before the PUCT, and not to TCOS filings, which are described below.
 Transmission rates may be updated up to two times per year through TCOS filings. In a TCOS filing, the revenue requirement is updated to reflect changes regarding assets placed in service, the effect of depreciation, updates to the ERCOT 4CP and changes in property taxes, among other matters. A utility is not permitted in these filings to update the revenue requirement to reflect any changes in operations and maintenance charges or accumulated deferred federal income tax (ADFIT), which are updated only during a full rate proceeding with the PUCT. If an application is materially sufficient and there are no intervenors that challenge the update, the transmission rates will generally be updated within 60 days of the date of the TCOS filing. The updates of the rates pursuant to a TCOS filing will be subject to review in the next rate case filing.
 Sharyland’s Rates
 The regulatory parameters in Sharyland’s rates and applicable to our regulated assets provide for a capital structure consisting of 55% debt and 45% equity, a cost of debt of 6.73%, a return on equity of 9.70% and a return on invested capital of 8.06% in calculating rates. Additionally, Sharyland’s rates also reflect the recovery of an income tax allowance, with respect to our transmission assets, at the 21% corporate federal income tax rate and, with respect to our wholesale distribution assets, at the prior 35% corporate federal income tax rate. Under existing PUCT orders, SDTS and Sharyland are required to file a new rate case by July 1, 2020 using the test year ending December 31, 2019. If the sale of InfraREIT is not completed and we are required to move forward with the 2020 rate case, the outcome of that rate case will result in an adjustment to many of the current regulatory parameters applicable to our regulated assets. These regulatory parameters include an adjustment to our allowed cost of debt to reflect the actual cost of debt as of the end of the test year, which currently is forecasted to be 4.91%, and an adjustment to Sharyland’s wholesale distribution rate to reflect the new 21% corporate federal income tax rate, as well as other potential adjustments to the parameters described above.
Our Relationship with Sharyland
 A REIT is required to generate a substantial portion of its income from REIT-qualified assets and through qualified income streams, which include lease payments from third-party tenants. As a result, we have structured ownership of our regulated assets through a lessor/lessee structure, with Sharyland acting as the tenant under each of our leases. Sharyland has been a regulated utility since 1999 and, as our lessee, has control of and is responsible for operating and maintaining our regulated assets.
 11

Sharyland is the managing member of SDTS and has operational control over our regulated assets pursuant to the leases. However, to the extent that day-to-day operations of SDTS involve matters primarily related to passive ownership of the assets, such as capital sourcing, financing, cash management and investor relations, Sharyland has delegated those responsibilities and authorities to InfraREIT pursuant to a delegation agreement. We also have negative control rights over SDTS, such as the right to approve renewals of the leases or any new leases, sales or dispositions of assets, debt issuances and annual budgets, subject to some exceptions.
 Our Relationship with Hunt
 We have various agreements with HCI and its subsidiaries (collectively, Hunt), Hunt Transmission Services, L.L.C. (Hunt Developer), Hunt Manager and Sharyland. The following chart illustrates our key relationships with each of these entities as of February 20, 2019.

(1) | Parties to the management agreement
----+------------------------------------


(2) | Parties to the development agreement
----+-------------------------------------


(3) | Sharyland is the managing member of SDTS; however, Sharyland’s economic interest in SDTS is de minimis, and Sharyland has delegated to us some of its managing member authority and obligations pursuant to a delegation agreement.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Lock-Up Agreement
 Hunt owns a substantial portion of our equity, and we have a lock-up agreement with Hunt, pursuant to which Hunt has agreed not to transfer or sell an aggregate of 8,419,987 of the shares of our common stock and OP Units that it currently owns. These transfer restrictions will expire on February 4, 2020. As of February 20, 2019, Hunt is the record holder of 6,334 shares of our common stock and 15,624,544 OP Units. Hunt’s lock-up agreement with us will terminate upon the termination or non-renewal of the management agreement and development agreement, both of which are discussed below.
 Management Agreement
 We are party to a management agreement with Hunt Manager pursuant to which Hunt Manager manages our day-to-day business, subject to oversight from our board of directors.
 12

Compensation
 The following table summarizes the fees and expense reimbursements that we pay to Hunt Manager pursuant to the management agreement:
 
 
Compensation | Description 
--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Base Fee | The base fee for each 12-month period beginning on April 1 will equal 1.5% of our total equity (including noncontrolling interest) as of the end of the immediately preceding year. The annual base fee for the period beginning April 1, 2018 through March 31, 2019 was $13.5 million. The pro-rated annual base fee for the period beginning April 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019, which is the expiration date of the current term of the management agreement, will be $10.4 million.
Incentive Payment | We will pay Hunt Manager an incentive payment, payable quarterly, equal to 20% of the quarterly distributions per OP Unit (inclusive of the incentive payment) in excess of $0.27 per OP Unit per quarter, if any. 
Reimbursement of Expenses | We reimburse Hunt Manager for all third-party expenses incurred on our behalf or otherwise in connection with the operation of our business, other than certain specified expenses, such as compensation expenses related to Hunt Manager's personnel, that are identified in the management agreement as the exclusive responsibility of Hunt Manager. 
Termination Fee | If we exercise our right not to renew the management agreement at the end of the then current term, we will be required to pay Hunt Manager a termination fee, in cash or equity, at our election, in an amount equal to three times the most recent annualized base management fee and incentive payment amount. 

Term
 The initial term of the management agreement expires December 31, 2019, and will automatically renew for successive five-year terms unless a majority of our independent directors decides to terminate the agreement. If a majority of our independent directors decides to terminate the agreement, we must give Hunt Manager notice of the termination at least three months in advance of the scheduled termination date, with respect to the initial term (see the caption SDTS Services Agreement and Management Agreement Amendment in Part II, Item 9B., Other Information), and at least one year in advance of the scheduled termination date, with respect to any renewal terms, and must pay Hunt Manager the termination fee described above. We also have the right to terminate the management agreement at any time for cause (as defined in the management agreement), and Hunt Manager may terminate the agreement at any time upon 365 days’ prior notice to us, provided that Hunt Manager may not terminate the agreement effective before December 31, 2019. If we terminate for cause or Hunt Manager terminates, the termination fee would not be owed to Hunt Manager.
 For additional information related to the management agreement, see the caption Management Agreement under Commercial Arrangements in the section Related Party Transactions in Part III, Item 13., Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.
 For information related to the pending sale of InfraREIT and asset exchange with Sharyland, including the proposed termination of the management agreement, see Pending Corporate Transactions below.
 Hunt’s Development Projects
 Development Agreement
 The development agreement with Hunt Developer and Sharyland gives us the exclusive right to continue to fund the development and construction of Footprint Projects and Hunt Developer the exclusive right to fund the development and construction of ROFO Projects. The development agreement also provides us with a right of first offer to acquire ROFO Projects.
 Under the terms of the development agreement, Hunt has the obligation to offer ROFO Projects to us prior to the project being energized. Hunt’s offer of a ROFO Project will commence a 75-day negotiation period; however, in certain circumstances, the parties may agree to extend the negotiation period past 75 days. Following this period, if we are unable to reach an agreement on the terms of such purchase, Hunt may, during the following 18 months, transfer the ROFO Project to a third party, but only on terms and conditions generally no more favorable than those offered to us. If the ROFO Project is not transferred to a third party during that time period, Hunt would once again be required to offer the project to us and begin another negotiation period with us before transferring the project to a third party.
 13

Additionally, under the terms of the development agreement, we are required to give Sharyland a right of first offer to lease any assets we acquire or develop, subject to exceptions. If we and Sharyland are unable to agree on lease terms and an exception does not apply, we will only be able to lease the assets to other tenants on terms that are more favorable to us than Sharyland’s best offer.
 The term of the development agreement expires December 31, 2019, and will automatically renew for successive five-year terms. However, our rights under the development agreement will expire effective upon any termination of the management agreement.
 For information related to the pending sale of InfraREIT and asset exchange with Sharyland, including the proposed termination of the development agreement, see Pending Corporate Transactions below.

Acquisitions by Us
 The Conflicts Committee of our board of directors will evaluate any potential acquisition of a project from Hunt or Sharyland and determine if the project is in our best interest based on the negotiated terms. The purchase price for any project will be negotiated based on a number of factors, such as the cash flow and rate base for the assets, market conditions, potential for incremental Footprint Projects, the terms of any related lease and the regulatory return we expect the assets will earn.
Pending Corporate Transactions
 Sale and Asset Exchange
 On October 18, 2018, InfraREIT and the Operating Partnership entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Oncor for $21.00 per share or OP Unit, as applicable, in cash, valued at approximately $1.275 billion, plus the assumption of our net debt of approximately $950 million as of December 31, 2018. Oncor has obtained equity financing commitments from Sempra Energy and the owners of Texas Transmission Investment LLC to provide an aggregate equity contribution of approximately $1.3 billion to finance the acquisition of InfraREIT and pay certain related fees and expenses.
 As a condition to Oncor’s acquisition of us, SDTS and Oncor also signed a definitive agreement with Sharyland to exchange, immediately prior to Oncor’s acquisition, SDTS’s South Texas assets for Sharyland’s Golden Spread Electric Cooperative interconnection located in the Texas Panhandle (Golden Spread Project), along with certain development projects in the Texas Panhandle and South Plains regions, including the Lubbock Power & Light interconnection. The difference between the net book value of the exchanged assets will be paid in cash at closing.
 14

The asset exchange with Sharyland and merger with Oncor are mutually dependent on one another, and neither will become effective without the closing of the other.
 Arrangements with Hunt
 Under our management agreement with Hunt Manager, which will be terminated upon the closing of the transactions, Hunt Manager is entitled to the payment of a termination fee upon the termination or non-renewal of the management agreement. The termination of the management agreement automatically triggers the termination of the development agreement between us and Hunt. We have agreed to pay Hunt approximately $40.5 million at the closing of the transactions to terminate the management agreement, development agreement, leases with Sharyland, and all other existing agreements between InfraREIT or our subsidiaries and Hunt, Sharyland or their affiliates. This amount is consistent with the termination fee, as calculated at the time we entered into the omnibus termination agreement, contractually required under the management agreement.
Agreements among Hunt, Oncor and Sempra Energy
 Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement and the asset exchange agreement, Sharyland and Sempra Energy entered into an agreement in which Sempra Energy will purchase a 50% limited partnership interest in Sharyland Holdings LP (Sharyland Holdings), which will own a 100% interest in Sharyland. The closing of Sempra Energy’s purchase is a requirement of the asset exchange agreement between SDTS and Sharyland. Additionally, under a separate agreement with Sharyland, Oncor agreed to operate and maintain all of Sharyland’s assets following the closing of the transactions.
Closing Conditions and Status
 The closing of the transactions is dependent upon and subject to several closing conditions, including:
  
• | PUCT approval of the transactions, including:
--+----------------------------------------------


o | exchange of assets with Sharyland;

 Early termination of the 30-day waiting period required by the HSR Act was received on December 14, 2018. On December 21, 2018, certain of the Operating Partnership’s subsidiaries entered into amendments that, effective as of the closing, will satisfy our closing condition with respect to the lender consents. Additionally, a special meeting of InfraREIT’s stockholders was held on February 7, 2019, at which time the stockholders voted to approve the transactions.
 In accordance with the definitive agreements, SDTS, Sharyland and Oncor filed a Sale-Transfer-Merger application (STM) with the PUCT on November 30, 2018, and a hearing on the merits is scheduled for April 10-12, 2019. The 180-day deadline for our STM is May 29, 2019, although the PUCT is permitted to extend that deadline for an additional 60 days if necessary.
 Subject to obtaining regulatory approvals, we expect the transactions to close by mid-2019.

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Impacts
 In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was signed into law. The TCJA reduced the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. At the time of the passage of the TCJA, Sharyland’s revenue requirement included its recovery in rates of an income tax allowance at the 35% corporate federal income tax rate, and our lease supplements with Sharyland with respect to our assets in service as of December 31, 2018 reflect this assumption. However, due to the enactment of the TCJA and at the request of the PUCT, Sharyland agreed to reduce its wholesale transmission service (WTS) rate to reflect an income tax allowance at the 21% corporate federal income tax rate during the first quarter of 2018. This reduction impacts our percentage rent revenues, which are calculated based on a percentage of Sharyland’s gross revenue. Further, the impact of the TCJA has and will be incorporated into new lease supplements for future assets placed in service or upon the renewal of our leases, resulting in a reduction, relative to our historical lease terms, in the amount of lease revenue we receive per dollar of rate base. For example, our lease supplements for assets placed in service through December 31, 2018 assume Sharyland’s recovery in rates of an income tax allowance at the 35% corporate federal income tax rate. For assets placed in service beginning January 1, 2019, our lease supplements assume Sharyland’s recovery in rates of an income tax allowance at the new 21% corporate federal income tax rate.
 It is also possible that, in the future, Sharyland could request a reduction in rent for existing assets already under lease to reflect the impacts of the TCJA; if such request is made, we are not obligated under the leases to agree to the requested change.
 Competition
 Improvements in existing technologies to produce, transmit or deliver electricity, including advancements related to self-generation and distributed generation or the creation of new technologies or services, could result in a reduction of demand for Sharyland’s regulated asset services, but these have not been significant factors to date.
 Additionally, the market for acquiring and developing electric infrastructure assets is highly competitive and fragmented, and we have seen an increase in both the amount of and different types of investors in these assets over the last several years. Many fully integrated utility companies, public and private funds and foreign investors pursue the types of investments that we compete for in the U.S. electric infrastructure sector. Some of these competitors may be substantially larger than us and have greater financial resources or lower costs of capital than we do.
 Customers
 We lease all our regulated assets to Sharyland, which supports its lease payments to us by collecting revenues from other utilities through PUCT-approved rates.
 Environmental Matters
 Our tenant’s day-to-day operations are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations across a large number of jurisdictions, including laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment, establish standards for the management, treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and solid and hazardous wastes, and impose obligations to investigate and remediate contamination in certain circumstances. We rely on our tenant for the compliance of our regulated assets with such laws and regulations. Under the terms of our leases, our tenant is required to indemnify us if we incur damages as a result of its failure to comply with any such law or regulation.
 These laws and regulations also generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained both before construction and during operation of regulated assets. As construction manager of our regulated asset projects, we also rely on our tenant for compliance with such permits and approvals, and our tenant is required to indemnify us if they fail to obtain or comply with any permit or approval in accordance with the terms of our leases.
 We do not believe that we currently have any material environmental liabilities.

Insurance
 Our leases require our tenant to carry liability and casualty insurance on our properties covering certain hazards with specific policy limits set forth in the lease agreements. However, there may not be adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction, or insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or, for some events, at all. For instance, Sharyland has not been able to obtain property insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms for the full value of our regulated assets. As a result, we have amended or waived the requirements under our leases that Sharyland obtain such insurance. In this respect, we and Sharyland are self-insured for a substantial portion of the amount that it would cost to repair or replace our regulated assets. In the event remediating any damage or loss is considered a repair under the applicable lease, our tenant is responsible for the cost of repairing or replacing such damage or loss whether or not covered by insurance. On the other hand, in the event remediating any damage or loss is considered a Footprint Project under the lease, we will be responsible for payment of any insurance deductible, as well as for any such damage or loss not covered by insurance. We believe that our regulated assets are covered by adequate insurance, including those regulated assets for which we and our tenant are self-insured.
Seasonality
 Sharyland’s transmission revenue is not subject to seasonality, although the revenue from Sharyland’s wholesale distribution assets is subject to seasonality. However, due to our lease revenue structure, no material portion of our business is affected by seasonality. See Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Part II, Item 7., Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 Employees
 We have no employees. We are externally managed by Hunt Manager. All our officers are employees of Hunt Manager. Pursuant to the terms of our management agreement, Hunt Manager provides for our day-to-day management, subject to oversight by our board of directors. In exchange for these management services, we pay a management fee to Hunt Manager. In the event Hunt Manager is unable to provide these services to us, we would be required to provide such services ourselves or obtain such services from other sources.
