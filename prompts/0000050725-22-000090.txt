Item 1. Business
Overview
Griffon Corporation (the “Company” or “Griffon”, "we", "us") is a diversified management and holding company that conducts business through wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company, founded in 1959, is a Delaware corporation headquartered in New York, N.Y. and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:GFF).
Business Strategy
We own and operate, and seek to acquire, businesses in multiple industries and geographic markets. Our objective is to maintain leading positions in the markets we serve by providing innovative, branded products with superior quality and industry-leading service. We place emphasis on our iconic and well-respected brands, which helps to differentiate us and our offerings from our competitors and strengthens our relationship with our customers and those who ultimately use our products.
Through operating a diverse portfolio of businesses, we expect to reduce variability caused by external factors such as market cyclicality, seasonality, and weather. We achieve diversity by providing various product offerings and brands through multiple sales and distribution channels and conducting business across multiple countries which we consider our home markets. 
Griffon oversees the operations of its subsidiaries, allocates resources among them and manages their capital structures. Griffon provides direction and assistance to its subsidiaries in connection with acquisition and growth opportunities as well as in connection with divestitures. As long-term investors, having substantial experience in a variety of industries, our intent is to continue the growth and strengthening of our existing businesses, and to diversify further through investments in our businesses and through acquisitions.
Over the past five years, we have undertaken a series of transformative transactions. We divested our specialty plastics business in 2018 to focus on our core markets and improve our free cash flow conversion. In our Consumer and Professional Products ("CPP") segment, we expanded the scope of our brands through the acquisition of Hunter Fan Company ("Hunter") on January 24, 2022 and ClosetMaid, LLC ("ClosetMaid") in 2018. In our Home and Building Products ("HBP") segment, we acquired CornellCookson, Inc. ("CornellCookson") in 2018, which has been integrated into Clopay Corporation ("Clopay"), creating a leading North American manufacturer and marketer of residential garage doors and sectional commercial doors, and rolling steel doors and grille products under brands that include Clopay, Ideal, Cornell and Cookson. We established an integrated headquarters for CPP in Orlando, Florida for our portfolio of leading brands that includes AMES, Hunter, True Temper and ClosetMaid. CPP is well positioned to fulfill its ongoing mission of Bringing Brands Together™ with the leading brands in consumer and professional tools; residential, industrial and commercial fans; home storage and organization products; and products that enhance indoor and outdoor lifestyles. 
On May 16, 2022, Griffon announced that its Board of Directors initiated a process to review a comprehensive range of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value including a sale, merger, divestiture, recapitalization or other strategic transaction. This process is active and discussions with potential counterparties are ongoing with respect to a number of these options. The Committee on Strategic Considerations, a committee comprised of independent directors who serve on Griffon's Board, is overseeing the process and working with Griffon's management and Goldman Sachs & Co, LLC. the Company's financial advisor. There is no assurance that the process will result in any transaction being entered into or consummated. 
On September 27, 2021, we announced we were exploring strategic alternatives for our Defense Electronics ("DE") segment, which consisted of our Telephonics Corporation ("Telephonics") subsidiary. On June 27, 2022, we completed the sale of Telephonics to TTM Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTMI) ("TTM") for $330,000 in cash, excluding customary post-closing adjustments, primarily related to working capital. Griffon classified the results of operations of our Telephonics business as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operation in the consolidated balance sheets. Accordingly, all references made to results and information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to Griffon's continuing operations, unless noted otherwise.
On December 17, 2021, Griffon entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Hunter, a market leader in residential ceiling, commercial, and industrial fans, from MidOcean Partners (“MidOcean”) for a contractual purchase price of $845,000 and completed the acquisition on January 24, 2022. Hunter, part of our CPP segment, complements and diversifies our portfolio of leading consumer brands and products. We financed the acquisition of Hunter with a new $800,000 seven-year Term Loan B facility; we used a combination of cash on hand and revolver borrowings to fund the balance of the purchase price and related acquisition and debt expenditures. 
Update of COVID-19 on Our Business
The health and safety of our employees, our customers and their families is always a high priority for Griffon. As of the date of this filing, all of Griffon's facilities are fully operational. Our supply chain experienced and, to some extent, is still recovering from certain disruptions which, together with other factors such as a shortage of labor, resulted in longer delivery lead times and restricted manufacturing capacity for certain of our products. When COVID-19 struck, we implemented a variety of new policies and procedures, including additional cleaning, social distancing, staggered shifts and prohibiting or significantly restricting on-site visitors, to minimize the risk to our employees of contracting COVID-19. While many of these precautions have been relaxed or eliminated as the health risk of COVID-19 has decreased, we would not hesitate to reinstitute and/or modify these policies and procedures as necessary should the health risk return to an unacceptable level. In such event, our businesses or our suppliers could be required by government authorities to temporarily cease operations; might be limited in their production capacity due to complying with restrictions relating to the operation of businesses to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19; or could suffer their own supply chain disruptions, impacting their ability to continue to supply us with the quantity of materials required by us.
We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take actions that impact our operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders. While we are unable to determine or predict the nature, duration or scope of the overall impact COVID-19 will have on our businesses, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, we believe it is important to discuss where our company stands today, how we have responded (and will continue to respond) to COVID 19 and how our operations and financial condition may change as COVID-19 evolves. 
Griffon believes it has adequate liquidity to invest in its existing businesses and execute its business plan, while managing its capital structure on both a short-term and long-term basis. At September 30, 2022, $290,385 of revolver capacity was available under Griffon's Credit Agreement and Griffon had cash and equivalents of $120,184.
Other Business Highlights
In August 2020 Griffon completed the Public Offering of 8,700,000 shares of our common stock for total net proceeds of $178,165. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under its Credit Agreement. The Company used the remainder of the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.
During 2020, Griffon issued, at par, $1,000,000 of 5.75% Senior Notes due in 2028 (the “2028 Senior Notes”). Proceeds from the 2028 Senior Notes were used to redeem the $1,000,000 of 5.25% Senior Notes due in 2022. 
In January 2020, Griffon amended its credit agreement to increase the total amount available for borrowing from $350,000 to $400,000, extend its maturity date from March 22, 2021 to March 22, 2025 and modify certain other provisions of the facility (the "Credit Agreement").
In November 2019, Griffon announced the development of a next-generation business platform for CPP to enhance the growth, efficiency, and competitiveness of its U.S. operations, and on November 12, 2020, Griffon announced that CPP is broadening this strategic initiative to include additional North American facilities, the AMES United Kingdom (U.K.) and Australia businesses, and a manufacturing facility in China. On April 28, 2022, Griffon announced a reduced scope and an accelerated timeline for the initiative, which was completed in fiscal 2022. These changes reflect the rapid progress made with the initiative, and reduced investment in facilities expansion and equipment given recent significant increases in construction and equipment costs. Any remaining expenditures, after the end of fiscal 2022, including those related to the deployment of AMES' global information systems, will be included in the continuing operations of the business. Future investments in equipment, particularly for automation, will be part of normal-course annual capital expenditures.
This initiative included three key development areas. First, certain AMES U.S. and global operations were consolidated to optimize facilities footprint and talent. Second, strategic investments in automation and facilities expansion were made to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing and fulfillment operations, and support e-commerce growth. Third, multiple 
independent information systems were unified into a single data and analytics platform, which will serve the whole AMES global enterprise.
We continue to expect that this initiative will result in annual cash savings of $25,000. Realization of expected cash savings will begin in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The cost to implement this new business platform, over the duration of the project, included one-time charges of approximately $51,869 and capital investments of approximately $15,000, net of future proceeds from the sale of exited facilities.
In June 2018, Clopay acquired CornellCookson, a leading provider of rolling steel service doors, fire doors, and grilles, for an effective purchase price of approximately $170,000. This transaction strengthened Clopay's strategic portfolio with a line of commercial rolling steel door products to complement Clopay's sectional door offerings in the commercial sector, and expanded the Clopay network of professional dealers focused on the commercial market. 
In March 2018, we announced the combination of the ClosetMaid operations with those of AMES, which improved operational efficiencies by leveraging the complementary products, customers, warehousing and distribution, manufacturing, and sourcing capabilities of the two businesses.
In February 2018, we closed on the sale of our Clopay Plastics Products ("Plastics") business to Berry Global, Inc. ("Berry") for approximately $465,000, net of certain post-closing adjustments, thus exiting the specialty plastics industry that the Company had entered when it acquired Clopay Corporation in 1986. This transaction provided immediate liquidity and improved Griffon's cash flow given the historically higher capital needs of the Plastics operations as compared to Griffon’s remaining businesses.
In October 2017, we acquired ClosetMaid from Emerson Electric Co. (NYSE:EMR) for an effective purchase price of approximately $165,000. ClosetMaid, founded in 1965, is a leading North American manufacturer and marketer of wood and wire closet organization, general living storage and wire garage storage products, and sells to some of the largest home center retail chains, mass merchandisers, and direct-to-builder professional installers in North America. We believe that ClosetMaid is the leading brand in its category, with excellent consumer recognition.
We believe these actions have established a solid foundation for growth in sales, profit, and cash generation and bolster Griffon’s platforms for opportunistic strategic acquisitions.
Other Acquisitions and Dispositions
On December 22, 2020, AMES acquired Quatro Design Pty Ltd (“Quatro”), a leading Australian manufacturer and supplier of glass fiber reinforced concrete landscaping products for residential, commercial, and public sector projects for a purchase price of AUD $3,500 (approximately $2,700). Quatro contributed approximately $5,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.
On November 29, 2019, AMES acquired Vatre Group Limited ("Apta"), a leading U.K. supplier of innovative garden pottery and associated products sold to leading U.K. and Ireland garden centers for approximately $10,500 (GBP 8,750), inclusive of a post-closing working capital adjustment, net of cash acquired. This acquisition broadens AMES' product offerings in the U.K. market and increases its in-country operational footprint. Apta contributed approximately $20,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition.
On February 13, 2018, AMES acquired Kelkay, a leading U.K. manufacturer and distributor of decorative outdoor landscaping products sold to garden centers, retailers and grocers in the U.K. and Ireland. This acquisition broadened AMES' product offerings in the market and increased its in-country operational footprint.
In November 2017, Griffon acquired Harper Brush Works, a leading U.S. manufacturer of cleaning products for professional, home, and industrial use, from Horizon Global (NYSE:HZN). This acquisition expanded the AMES line of long-handle tools in North America to include brooms, brushes, and other cleaning products.
During fiscal 2017, Griffon also completed a number of other acquisitions to expand and enhance AMES' global footprint. In the United Kingdom, Griffon acquired La Hacienda, an outdoor living brand of unique heating and garden décor products, in July 2017. The acquisition of La Hacienda, together with the February 2018 acquisition of Kelkay and November 2020 acquisition of Apta, provides AMES with additional brands and a platform for growth in the U.K. market and access to leading garden centers, retailers, and grocers in the UK and Ireland. In Australia, Griffon acquired Hills Home Living, the iconic brand 
of clotheslines and home products, from Hills Limited (ASX:HIL) in December 2016, and in September 2017 Griffon acquired Tuscan Path, an Australian provider of pots, planters, pavers, decorative stone, and garden décor products. The Hills, Tuscan Path and December, 2020 Quatro acquisitions broadened AMES' outdoor living and lawn and garden business, strengthening AMES’ portfolio of brands and its market position in Australia and New Zealand.

CONSUMER AND PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS
Consumer and Professional Products (“CPP”) is a leading North American manufacturer and a global provider of branded consumer and professional tools; residential, industrial and commercial fans; home storage and organization products; and products that enhance indoor and outdoor lifestyles. CPP sells products globally through a portfolio of leading brands including AMES, Hunter and ClosetMaid. AMES, founded in Massachusetts in 1774, has the distinction of being one of the oldest companies in continuous operation in the United States. Over its long life, AMES has grown organically and through the acquisition of other leading and historic tool businesses such as True Temper, Union Tools, and Garant. Today, AMES is a leading manufacturer of long-handled tools and landscaping products for homeowners and professionals in North America, and also provides these products in key global markets including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., and Ireland. Under the ClosetMaid brand, CPP is the leading provider of wood and wire closet organization, general living storage, and wire garage storage products in the United States. Under the Hunter brand, since 1886, CPP is a leading provider of residential, industrial and commercial fans in the United States.
Since the acquisition of AMES by Griffon in 2010, CPP has benefited from strategic acquisitions that have expanded its product portfolio and geographic presence. The Hunter Fan, ClosetMaid, Southern Patio, and Harper Brush Works acquisitions added to, or expanded CPP's product categories in North America to include residential, industrial and commercial fans, storage and organization, decorative landscaping, and cleaning products. The acquisitions of Northcote, Cyclone, Hills, Nylex, Tuscan Path and Quatro in Australia established AMES as a leading supplier of tools and landscaping categories in the Australian market. As a result of the acquisitions of Kelkay, La Hacienda and Apta, the U.K. and Ireland have become key markets for AMES products. 
CPP has approximately 3,200 employees worldwide.

Brands
CPP's brands are among the most recognized across its primary product categories in North America, Australia and the United Kingdom. Its brand portfolio for long-handled tools, outdoor décor, and landscaping product includes AMES®, True Temper®, Garant®, Harper®, UnionTools®, Westmix™, Cyclone®, Southern Patio®, Northcote Pottery™, Nylex®, Hills®, Kelkay®, Tuscan Path®, La Hacienda®, Kelso™, Dynamic Design®™, Apta® and Quatro Design®. Contractor-oriented tool brands include Razor-Back® Professional Tools and Jackson® Professional Tools. CPP's home organization, general living storage, and garage storage products are sold primarily under the ClosetMaid® brand. CPP's residential, industrial and commercial fan products are sold under the Hunter Fan and Casablanca brands.
This strong portfolio of brands enables CPP to build and maintain long-standing relationships with leading retailers and distributors. In addition, given the breadth of its brand portfolio and product category depth, CPP is able to offer specific, differentiated branding strategies for key retail customers. These strategies focus on enhancement of brand value, with the goal of de-commoditizing CPP products through identity and functionality elements that makes each top brand unique, attractive and visually recognizable by the consumer. 
Products

CPP manufactures and markets a broad portfolio of long-handled tools, landscaping products, home organization products and residential, industrial and commercial fans. This portfolio contains many iconic brands and is anchored by six core product categories: seasonal outdoor tools, project tools, outdoor décor and watering, home organization, fans and cleaning products. As a result of brand portfolio recognition, outstanding product quality, industry leading service and strong customer relationships, CPP has earned market-leading positions in its six core product categories.

Customers
CPP sells products throughout North America, Australia, New Zealand, the U.K. and Ireland through (1) home centers, such as The Home Depot, Inc. (“Home Depot”), Lowe’s Companies Inc. (“Lowe’s”), Rona Inc., Bunnings Warehouse ("Bunnings") and Woodies (with the average length of the relationship with these customers being approximately 30 years); (2) mass market, specialty, and hardware retailers including Tractor Supply Corporation (“Tractor Supply”), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ("Walmart"), Target Corporation ("Target"), Canadian Tire Corporation, Limited ("Canadian Tire"), Costco Wholesale Corporation ("Costco"), Ace, Do-It-Best and True Value Company; (3) industrial distributors, such as W.W. Grainger, Inc. and ORS Nasco; (4) homebuilders, such as D.R. Horton, KB Home, Lennar and NVR, Inc.; and (5) E-commerce platforms, such as Amazon Inc. (“Amazon”), Wayfair Inc., (“Wayfair), Hayneedle Inc., “(Hayneedle”), Overstock Inc. (“Overstock”) , and Spreetail LLC. (“Spreetail”). 

Home Depot, Lowe's, Menards and Bunnings are significant customers of CPP. The loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the CPP business and on Griffon.

Product Development

CPP product development efforts focus on both new products and product line extensions. CPP continually improves existing products as well as develops new products to satisfy consumer needs, expand revenue opportunities, maintain or extend competitive advantages, increase market opportunity and reduce production costs. Products are developed through in-house industrial design and engineering staffs to introduce new products and product line extensions that are timely and cost effective.
Sales and Marketing

CPP's sales organization is structured by product line and distribution channel in the U.S., and by country internationally. In the U.S., a dedicated team of sales professionals is provided for each of the large retail customers. Offices are maintained adjacent to each of the two largest customers’ headquarters, supported by a shared in-house sales analyst. In addition, sales professionals are assigned to domestic, wholesale and industrial distribution channels. Sales teams located in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Ireland handle sales in each of their respective regions. In Australia, a dedicated team of sales professionals is provided for the largest retail customer. CPP has made significant investments in automation, facilities expansion and fulfillment operations to support e-commerce growth. 
Raw Materials and Suppliers

CPP's primary raw material inputs include resin (primarily polypropylene and high density polyethylene), wood (particleboard and hardwoods including ash, hickory and poplar logs) and steel (hot rolled, cold rolled, and wire rod). All raw materials are generally available from a number of sources. Certain components are purchased, such as heavy forged components and wheelbarrow tires. Most final assembly is completed internally in order to ensure consistent quality. CPP also sources certain finished goods, primarily in storage and organization, outdoor décor, residential, industrial and commercial fans, and tools for non-North American locations. 
Competition

The long-handled tools and landscaping product industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Most competitors consist of small, privately-held companies focusing on a single product category. Some competitors, such as Fiskars Corporation in the hand tool and pruning tool market and Truper Herramientas S.A. de C.V. in the long-handled and garden tool space, compete in various tool categories. Suncast Corporation competes in the hose reel and accessory market, and more recently in the long-handled plastic snow shovel category. In addition, there is competition from imported or sourced products from China, India and other low-cost producing countries, particularly in long-handled tools, wheelbarrows, planters, striking tools and pruning tools.

The home storage and organizational solutions industry is also highly fragmented. CPP, primarily under the ClosetMaid brands, sells through retail, direct to consumer (e-commerce category) and direct to installer (building) channels and competes with a significant number of companies across each of these unique channels. Principal competition for retail wire products is from Newell Brands, Inc. through their Rubbermaid® product line. FirstService Brands, Inc. sells competing wood solutions under the brand California Closets®, but does not sell through the retail or direct to consumer channels.
The residential, industrial, and commercial fan industry is fragmented. CPP, under the highly recognized Hunter brand, sells through direct to consumer (e-commerce category), retail, and direct to installer (industrial and commercial) channels. CPP's principal competitors in the consumer ceiling fan market are retailer house brands such as Hampton Bay in The Home Depot and Harbor Breeze in Lowe’s, followed by Minka Air. In the industrial and commercial fan space, principal competitors are Big Ass Fans, Rite-Hite, Macro Air, and Minka Air. 
CPP differentiates itself and provides the best value to customers through its successful history of innovation, dependable supply chain and high on-time delivery rates, quality, product performance, and highly recognized product brands. CPP's size, depth and breadth of product offering, category knowledge, research and development (“R&D”) investment, service and its ability to react to sudden changes in demand from seasonal weather patterns, especially during harsh winter months, are competitive advantages. Offshore manufacturers lack sufficient product innovation, capacity, proximity to market and distribution capabilities to service large retailers or to efficiently and effectively compete in highly seasonal, weather related product categories.
Manufacturing and Distribution

CPP has a combination of internal and external, and domestic and foreign, manufacturing sources from which it sources products for sale in the markets it serves. Principal North American manufacturing facilities include 644,000 square feet of manufacturing operations in Harrisburg and Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, a 676,000 square foot facility in Ocala, Florida, and a 353,000 square foot manufacturing center in St. Francois, Quebec, Canada. CPP operates smaller manufacturing facilities, including wood mills, at several other locations in the United States, and internationally in Jiangmen, China; and Grafton, New South Wales and Wonthaggi, Victoria, both in Australia. 
CPP has three principal distribution facilities in the United States, a 1.4 million square foot facility in Carlisle, Pennsylvania a 997,000 square foot facility in Reno, Nevada and a 600,000 square foot facility in Byhalia, MS. Finished goods are transported to these facilities from both North American manufacturing sites and from North American ports by both an internal fleet, as well as over the road trucking and rail. Additionally, light assembly is performed at the Carlisle and Reno locations. Smaller distribution centers are also strategically located in the U.S. in Ocala, Florida, and internationally in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and Ireland. 
HOME AND BUILDING PRODUCTS

The HBP segment consists of Clopay. Founded in 1964 and acquired by Griffon in 1986, Clopay has grown organically and through acquisitions to become the largest manufacturer and marketer of garage doors and rolling steel doors in North America. Clopay also manufactures a complete line of entry door systems uniquely designed to complement its popular residential garage door styles. The majority of Clopay's sales come from home remodeling and renovation projects, with the balance from commercial construction and new residential housing construction. Sales into the home remodeling market are driven by the aging of the housing stock, existing home sales activity, and the trends of improving both home appearance and energy efficiency. Sales into the commercial market are driven by the aging of nonresidential buildings, including warehouses, institutional and industrial facilities, increased business activity, changes to building codes, security of facilities and trends of improving function and performance. 

Clopay has approximately 2,900 employees.
Brands

Clopay brings over 50 years of experience and innovation to the residential and sectional garage door industry, and has over 100 years of experience in the rolling steel industry. Residential and commercial sectional products are sold under market-leading brands including Clopay®, America’s Favorite Garage Doors®, Holmes Garage Door Company® and IDEAL Door®. Clopay commercial rolling steel door brands include Cornell®, Cookson® and Clopay®. 
Products and Service

Clopay manufactures a broad line of residential sectional garage doors with a variety of options, at varying prices. Clopay offers garage doors made primarily from steel, plastic composite and wood, and also sells related products, such as garage door openers manufactured by third parties. Clopay also offers a complete line of entry door systems uniquely designed to complement its popular residential garage door styles.

Commercial door products manufactured and marketed by Clopay include rolling steel service doors, fire doors, shutters, steel security grilles, and room dividers. Clopay also manufactures and markets commercial sectional doors, which are similar to residential garage doors, but are designed to meet the more demanding performance specifications of a commercial application.

Customers

Clopay is currently the exclusive supplier of residential garage doors throughout North America to Home Depot and Menards. The loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on Clopay and Griffon. Clopay distributes its garage doors directly to customers from its manufacturing facilities and through its distribution centers located throughout the U.S. and Canada. These distribution centers allow Clopay to maintain an inventory of garage doors near installing dealers and provide quick-ship service to retail and professional dealer customers.
Product Development

Clopay product development efforts focus on both new products and improvements to existing products. Products are developed through in-house design and engineering staffs.

Clopay operates technical development centers where its research engineers design and develop new products and technologies and perform durability and performance testing of new and existing products, materials and finishes. Clopay continually improves its door offerings through these development efforts, focusing on characteristics such as strength, design, operating performance and durability, and energy efficiency. The process engineering teams also work to develop new manufacturing processes and production techniques aimed at improving manufacturing efficiencies and ensuring quality-made products.
Sales and Marketing

The Clopay sales and marketing organization supports our customers, consults on new product development and aggressively markets door solutions, with a primary focus on the North American market. Clopay maintains a strong promotional presence, in both traditional and digital media. 
Clopay customers utilize a proprietary residential door web application, the MyDoor® mobile enabled app, that guides consumers through an easy to use visualization and pricing program, allowing them to select the optimal door for their home. For Clopay's commercial products, Clopay's Commercial Door Quoter (CDQ®™) and CornellCookson's WebGen™ systems are available to assist our professional dealers streamline their quoting and submittal process for greater productivity and back office efficiency improvement. 
Raw Materials and Suppliers

The principal raw material used in Clopay's manufacturing is galvanized steel. Clopay also utilizes certain hardware components, as well as wood and insulated foam. All raw materials are generally available from a number of sources.
Competition

The sectional garage door and commercial rolling steel door industry includes several large national manufacturers and many smaller, regional and local manufacturers. Clopay competes on the basis of service, quality, price, brand awareness and product design.

Clopay brand names are widely recognized in the building products industry. Clopay believes that it has earned a reputation among installing dealers and retailers for producing a broad range of innovative, high-quality doors with industry leading lead times. Clopay's market position and brand recognition are key marketing tools for expanding its customer base, leveraging its distribution network and increasing its market share.

Manufacturing and Distribution

Clopay's principal manufacturing facilities include 1,480,000 square feet in Troy and Russia, Ohio, 279,000 square feet in Mountain Top, Pennsylvania and 163,000 square feet in Goodyear, Arizona.

Clopay distributes its products through a wide range of distribution channels, including a national network of 52 distribution centers with a total of approximately 1,200,000 square feet. Additionally, products are sold to over 2,500 independent professional installing dealers and to major home center retail chains including Home Depot and Menards (with the average length of the relationship with these customers being greater than 25 years). Clopay maintains strong relationships with its installing dealers and believes it is the largest supplier of sectional garage doors to the retail and professional installing channels in North America and the largest supplier of rolling steel door products in North America. Clopay is currently the exclusive supplier of residential garage doors throughout North America to Home Depot and Menards.

On September 27, 2021, Griffon announced it was exploring strategic alternatives for its Defense Electronics segment, which consisted of Telephonics Corporation ("Telephonics"), and on June 27, 2022, Griffon completed the sale of Telephonics to TTM for $330,000, excluding certain customary post-closing adjustments, primarily related to working capital. Griffon classified the results of operations of the Telephonics business as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operation as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets. Accordingly, all references made to results and information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to Griffon's continuing operations unless noted otherwise.
Griffon Corporation

Employees
As of September 30, 2022, Griffon and its subsidiaries employ approximately 6,200 employees located primarily throughout the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and China.  Generally, the total number of employees of Griffon and its subsidiaries does not significantly fluctuate throughout the year.  However, acquisition activity or the opening of new branches or lines of business, or other changes in the level of Griffon's business activity (for instance, based on actual or anticipated customer demand or other factors), could require staffing level adjustments.
Approximately 70 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements in the U.S., with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union (an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations), and the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union.  Additionally, approximately 200 employees in Canada are represented by the Trade Union Advisory Committee. Griffon believes its relationships with its employees are satisfactory.
In managing its human capital resources, Griffon aims to attract a qualified workforce through an inclusive and accessible recruiting process that utilizes online recruiting platforms, campus outreach, internships and job fairs. Griffon also seeks to retain employees by offering competitive wages, benefits and training opportunities, as well as promoting a safe and healthy workplace. Griffon and all of its businesses strictly comply with all applicable state, local and international laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which Griffon and its businesses have facilities. This applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including recruiting, hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leaves of absence, compensation and training. All applicants and employees are treated with the same high level of respect regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or protected veteran status.
Regulation

Griffon’s operations are subject to various environmental, health, and employee safety laws and regulations. Griffon believes that it is in material compliance with these laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with environmental, health, and employee safety laws and regulations have not materially affected, and are not expected to materially affect, Griffon’s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Nevertheless, Griffon cannot guarantee that, in the future, it will not incur additional costs for compliance or that such costs will not be material.
Customers

A small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon’s consolidated revenue. In 2022, Home Depot represented 13% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue, 19% of CPP's revenue and 7% of HBP's revenue.
No other customer accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenue. Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon’s largest customers and Griffon's relationships with them. Orders from these customers are subject to change and may fluctuate materially. The loss of all or a portion of volume from any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on Griffon’s financial results, liquidity and operations.
Seasonality

Griffon's revenue and earnings are generally lowest in our first and fourth quarters ending December 31, and September 30, respectively, and highest in the second and third quarters ending March 31, and June 30, respectively, primarily due to the seasonality within the CPP and HBP businesses. In 2022, with the addition of Hunter Fan, 58% (55%, excluding Hunter Fan sales) of CPP's' sales occurred during the second and third quarters compared to 53% in both 2021 and 2020. HBP’s business is driven by renovation and construction during warm weather, which is historically at reduced levels during the winter months, generally in our second quarter.
Demand for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during peak gardening season. AMES' sales volume can be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, hurricanes, water shortages or floods. In addition, lack of snow or lower than average snowfall during the winter season may result in reduced sales of certain AMES' products, such as snow shovels and other snow tools. As a result, AMES' results of operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.

Intellectual Property

Griffon follows a practice of actively protecting and enforcing its proprietary rights in the U.S. and throughout the world where Griffon’s products are sold. All intellectual property information presented in this section is as of September 30, 2022.
Trademarks are of significant importance to Griffon’s HBP and CPP businesses. With 50 years of experience and innovation in the garage door industry, and over 100 years of experience in the rolling steel door industry, HBP has a significant level of goodwill in its strong family of brands, including: Clopay®, America’s Favorite Doors®; Holmes Garage Door Company®; IDEAL Door®; and the Cornell® and Cookson® commercial door brands. Principal global and regional trademarks used by CPP for its tool and landscape products include AMES®, True Temper®, Garant®, Harper®, UnionTools®, Westmix™, Cyclone®, Southern Patio®, Northcote Pottery™, Nylex®, Hills®, Kelkay®, Tuscan Path®, La Hacienda®, Kelso™, Apta®, and Dynamic Design®, as well as contractor-oriented brands including Razor-Back® Professional Tools and Jackson® Professional Tools. Storage and home organization brands within CPP include ClosetMaid®, MasterSuite®, Suite Symphony®, Cubeicals®, ExpressShelf®, SpaceCreations®, Maximum Load®, SuperSlide® and ShelfTrack®. CPP’s Hunter Fan Company has over 135 years of experience in the ceiling fan industry with well-recognized brands including Hunter®, Casablanca®, Hunter Industrial®, and Jan Fan®. The HBP and CPP businesses have approximately 1,671 registered trademarks and approximately 174 pending trademark applications around the world. Griffon’s rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used and registered.
Patents are also important to the HBP and CPP businesses. HBP holds approximately 45 issued patents and 23 pending patent applications in the U.S., as well as approximately 19 and 46 corresponding foreign patents and patent applications, primarily related to garage door system components and operation. CPP protects its designs and product innovation through the use of patents, and currently has approximately 723 issued patents and approximately 211 pending patent applications in the U.S., as well as approximately 310 and 107 corresponding foreign patents and patent applications, respectively. Design patents are generally valid for fourteen years, and utility patents are generally valid for twenty years, from the date of filing. Griffon's patents are in various stages of their terms of validity.
Environmental, Social and Governance
Griffon and its operating companies have always taken into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations in the management of our businesses. Griffon is a subscriber to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and published its inaugural annual ESG report, in relation to fiscal 2021, benchmarked to both UNGC Sustainable Development Goals and to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board criteria. The Griffon ESG policy and fiscal 2021 ESG Report can be found on the Griffon website at www.griffon.com. 
The fiscal 2021 ESG Report discusses community involvement, charitable giving, employee safety, employee education and welfare, energy consumption, water consumption, waste generated, recycled raw materials, and packaging initiatives. We are preparing to set ESG goals in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 based on the metrics gathered in fiscal 2021, which process continued through 2022, and will continue through fiscal 2023.
Griffon has assessed the environmental risk from its operations and has focused its efforts to date on areas with the potential to have the greatest environmental impact. Where available, we use recycled materials to construct our products, and we continuously improve our packaging to reduce both volume and environmental impact. For example, bags used for AMES’ Kelkay aggregate products in the UK are made from plant-based materials, and not from petroleum. Seventy percent of the steel used in HBP's garage doors is recycled steel. AMES is a member of the Appalachian Hardwood Manufacturers Association, which provides sustainable hardwoods for AMES tools, and is committed to purchasing hardwoods through the Sustainable Forestry Initiative.
Griffon continues its efforts to reduce carbon emissions by reducing electricity and natural gas usage at its operating facilities. Our Clopay business helps its customers reduce their own carbon footprints by providing garage doors that meet LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) building construction standards. While Griffon’s facilities are not large consumers of water, we routinely examine options to reduce water usage or reuse water at our facilities. AMES used recycled AMES and ClosetMaid tools and scrap materials in the construction of the new AMES headquarters facility in the Orlando, Florida area. Over the years, Griffon operating companies have reduced the use of solvents and other chemicals and now rarely generate hazardous waste of any kind.
Our operating companies are involved in the local communities in which they operate. We are involved in more than 100 charitable and community organizations, including well known national concerns such as Habitat for Humanity, Boys and Girls Clubs, the Home Depot Foundation (Diamond Sponsor) and the American Cancer Society, as well as local groups such as garden clubs. For example, employees at our Clopay subsidiary built a new home for Habitat for Humanity, and AMES contributed tools and products to that effort. Our communities know that they can count on us in a crisis. 
Over the last five years, we have invested millions of dollars in capital improvements relating to energy consumption and to employee safety and health. These improvements include lighting energy efficiency projects saving in excess of 1.5 million kilowatt-hours, major upgrades to our loading and unloading operations (which had been the source of a significant portion of our worker injuries), ergonomic improvements, machine guarding and elimination of certain high-risk repetitive jobs through use of robotics. Griffon has also invested significant time and capital reducing ergonomic injuries through better work positioning and lifting improvements. Griffon has also invested over one million dollars in improvements to employee welfare facilities, such as break areas and cafeterias. We view our employees as more than just workers. Through our Employee Stock Ownership Plan, our U.S. employees own approximately nine percent of Griffon stock. Our businesses engage in a variety of outreach programs in the various communities in which we operate to recruit new employees at all levels. These programs involve high schools and vocational schools, as well as colleges and universities, and often include internships as a means for potential new employees to experience what it is like to be part of our team. We also have a variety of onboarding programs, onsite job training programs, leadership development programs, and tuition reimbursement and education assistance policies to further the development and advancement of our employees.
In all of our geographies, we use on-site inspections and specific contractual terms to manage our supply chains to ensure compliance with environmental and social laws and regulations, as well as our policies in these areas, including with respect to human rights, child labor, slave labor and unsafe working conditions. All significant CPP suppliers worldwide must periodically submit to a Factory Compliance and Capacity Assessment, which evaluates not only quality control and vendor capabilities, but assesses to what extent each supplier emphasizes environmental, labor and social considerations in the operation of its business. These activities have continued despite the travel difficulties caused by COVID. In China, where CPP both operates a manufacturing facility and sources materials and products from third parties, CPP has dedicated compliance personnel who report directly into CPP’ General Counsels.
Honesty, transparency, and ethical practices have been ordinary course at Griffon for decades, and we continue to review and upgrade our programs in these areas. Our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct ("Code"), to which every employee certifies annually, requires that each and every employee conduct business to the highest ethical standards. Any acts of bribery are strictly prohibited, as is human trafficking and activities supporting human trafficking, such as the use of conflicts minerals. The Code prohibits all business courtesies except for those with an insignificant value, and even then, only under limited circumstances. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines are published on our website. While the guidelines require that a majority of directors be independent, currently all of our directors are independent except our CEO (constituting over 92% of our directors). Griffon has appointed a lead independent director and has four principal board committees - Audit, Compensation, 
Nominating and Corporate Governance, and Finance - each of which has its responsibilities set forth in a charter available on the Griffon website.
We expect each of our employees around the world to work hard to deliver outstanding products to our customers and to deliver value to our shareholders. And, while doing so, we expect them to respect and adhere to our environmental, social and governance commitments and policies, and to make our company a place at which all employees are proud to come to work every day.
