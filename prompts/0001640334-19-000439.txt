Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements
 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Because they discuss future events or conditions, forward-looking statements may include words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “intend,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “may,” “seek,” “plan,” “might,” “will,” “pursue,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “predict,” “project,” “goals,” “strategy,” “future,” “likely,” “forecast,” “potential,” “continue,” negatives thereof or similar references to future periods. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we make regarding:

· | Business strategies; 
· | Future cash flows; 
· | Financing plans; 
· | Plans and objectives of management; 
· | Any other statements regarding future acquisitions, future cash needs, future operations, business plans and future financial results; and
· | Any other statements that are not historical facts. 

 
Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual future results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:
 

· | Volatility or decline of our stock price; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Potential fluctuation of quarterly results; 
· | Failure of the Company to earn revenues or profits; 
· | Inadequate capital to continue or expand our business, and inability to raise additional capital or financing to implement its business plans; 
· | Decline in demand for our products and services; 
· | Rapid adverse changes in markets; 
· | Litigation with or legal claims and allegations by outside parties against the Company; 
· | Insufficient revenues to cover operating costs; 
· | Inability to source attractive investment deal flow on terms favorable to the Company; and 
· | Such other factors as discussed throughout Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

 
There is no assurance that we will be profitable, we may not be able to attract or retain qualified executives and personnel, we may not be able to obtain customers for future products or services, additional dilution in outstanding stock ownership may be incurred due to the issuance of more shares, warrants and stock options, or the exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options, and other risks inherent in our businesses.
 
Because the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We caution you not to place undue reliance on the statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue. We do not undertake any obligation to review or confirm analysts’ expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

General Overview
 
ABV Consulting, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “ABVN” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada on October 15, 2013. At formation, the Company authorized 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. In connection with our formation, the Company’s founder, Andrew Gavrin, received 5,000,000 shares of common stock as founder shares, and Mr. Gavrin served as the Company’s chief executive officer, chief financial officer and sole director from the time of incorporation until August 22, 2016.
 
The Company was originally formed to engage in merchandising and consulting services to craft beer brewers and distributors, as well as providing additional branding and marketing support within the craft beer industry to retailers and other organizations. The Company’s customer base consisted of alcohol beverage manufacturers, distributors, retailers, beer festival operators and other organizations involved in the sale and marketing of craft beer.
 
We focused our early efforts on pro bono engagements and secured one paid engagement for $2,000 by the close of our second quarter in 2016.
 
On August 22, 2016, in connection with the sale of a controlling interest in the Company, Mr. Gavrin sold to Ms. Ping Zhang the entire amount of his 5,000,000 shares of common stock for an aggregate price of $228,400 (the “Change of Control Transaction”). In connection with the Change of Control Transaction, Mr. Gavrin agreed pay $25,186.25 of debts of the Company in addition to the cancellation of $35,000 worth of debt owed to him by the Company. Concurrent with the Change of Control Transaction, Mr. Gavrin resigned from all corporate officer and director roles, and was replaced in all roles by Mr. Wai Lim Wong.
 
On December 19, 2016, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of the Company’s common stock from 100,000,000 to 3,000,000,000 shares, par value $0.0001.
 
On February 24, 2017, ABV entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Allied Plus (Samoa) Limited, an international company incorporated in Samoa with limited liability (“APSL”), and each of APSL’s shareholders (collectively, the “Sellers”), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the Company would effect an acquisition of APSL by acquiring from the Sellers all outstanding equity interests of APSL (the “Acquisition”).
 
Pursuant to the Agreement, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of APSL, the Company would issue 1,980,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Exchange Shares”) to the Sellers. The Exchange Shares to be allocated among the Sellers pro-rata based on each Seller’s ownership of APSL prior to the Acquisition. The Exchange Shares to be subject to a lock-up as set forth in the Agreement.
 
On February 28, 2017, ABV closed the share exchange (the “Exchange”) pursuant to the terms of Agreement. In connection with the closing, on February 28, 2017, the Company filed Articles of Exchange with the Secretary of State for the State of Nevada, which Articles of Exchange became effective upon filing
 
At the closing of the Exchange, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interests of APSL from the Sellers, and the Company issued to the Sellers, pro-rata based on each Seller’s ownership percentage of APSL prior to the Exchange, 1,980,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (representing approximately 99.72% of the Company’s outstanding common stock). As a result, the Sellers became stockholders of the Company and APSL became a subsidiary of the Company.

APSL was incorporated in Samoa on January 11, 2016, for the purposes of sourcing and developing tourism and entertainment-related investment projects in Malaysia and Southeast Asia in connection with the People’s Republic of China’s broad “One Belt, One Road” regional investment and development initiative, and for other purposes.
 
On June 19, 2017, APSL acquired 100% issued and outstanding equity of ABV Consulting Limited (“ABV HK”) which was incorporated in Hong Kong, China, and ABV HK became the wholly subsidiary of APSL.
 
On December 19, 2017, the board of directors of ABV and certain shareholders of the Company (“Shareholders”) entered into a Mutual Rescission Agreement (the “Rescission Agreement”). The Rescission Agreement rescinded the share exchange agreement dated February 24, 2017 (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), between the equity interest owners of Allied Plus (Samoa) Limited (“Allied Plus”), who are also the Shareholders, and the Company.
 
The Share Exchange Agreement provided for the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of Allied Plus (“Equity Interests”) by the Company in consideration of the issuance of 1,980,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Shares”) to the Shareholders. The Shares were issued to the Shareholders and the Equity Interests were transferred to the Company.
 
The Rescission Agreement provided that the Shareholders would return all of the Shares to the Company in consideration for the return of the Equity Interests to the Shareholders. The Shares would be cancelled and returned to the Company’s treasury. The Shareholders signed stock powers (“Stock Powers”) in favor of the Company, and the Stock Powers and Shares were delivered to the Company’s transfer agent for cancellation.
 
With the completion of the Rescission Agreement, APSL is no longer a subsidiary of the Company.
 
Accordingly, APSL sold the 100% issued and outstanding equity of ABV Consulting Limited (“ABV HK”) to the Company, and ABV HK became our wholly owned subsidiary.
 
Our address is Unit 1101-1102, 11/F, Railway Plaza, 39 Chatham Road S., Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong. Our corporate website is www.abvnus.com.
 
We have one wholly subsidiary, ABV Consulting Limited (HK), a Hong Kong company.
 
We have not ever declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or involved in any kind of legal proceeding.
 
Our Current Business
 
Following the Change of Control Transaction, our new management decided to pursue a strategic acquisition strategy focused on acquisition target companies with operations located primarily in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, the People’s Republic of China (including Hong Kong and Macau) (the “PRC”), Taiwan and other jurisdictions within Asia. In connection with this new strategy, we moved our corporate headquarters from Pennsylvania to Hong Kong. We believe that the PRC’s “One Belt, One Road” (“OBOR”) regional cooperation initiative will be a significant driver for strategic investment opportunities throughout Asia.
“One Belt, One Road”
 
Between September and October 2013, the PRC government disclosed its plan to pursue a regional trade, investment, infrastructure and cultural exchange program incorporating approximately sixty countries located along the historic silk road trading route connecting Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Central and East Asia—called the “Silk Road Economic Belt”—and also nations located in the South China Sea, the South Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean—called the “Maritime Silk Road.” The initiative has since been labeled “One Belt, One Road” or “OBOR” for short, and in 2014 the Chinese foreign minister identified OBOR as the single most important feature of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s foreign policy.
 
The PRC government intends to invest at least $4 trillion over an indefinite time period on projects located within OBOR constituent countries, and hundreds of projects worth approximately $1 trillion have been approved to date.

OBOR-Related Investment Opportunities
 
We anticipate that entities based in Hong Kong will continue their historic gatekeeping function as financial and advisory intermediaries between the PRC and the world at large, and Asia in particular. We intend to avail ourselves of this strategic advantage to pursue strategic co-investments with entities deploying OBOR-related funds and to invest into companies and assets that are well positioned to benefit from OBOR-related investments.
Objectives and Strategies
 
We explored a number of strategic investment opportunities following the Change of Control Transaction, but we did not enter into any definitive agreements by the end of FY2017. See our Current Report on Form 8-K, dated March 2, 2017, for a description of our former acquisition of Allied Plus (Samoa) Limited (“APSL”), which closed on February 28, 2017 and rescinded on December 19, 2017.
 
In pursuing our acquisition strategy, we are guided by our core objective of maximizing stockholder value by sourcing and acquiring assets with stable cash flow and/or significant growth potential connected to OBOR-related investment and trade and our ability to assist the investment target with securing economic and financial resources.
 
APSL primarily engaged in the business of providing services to agents and financial advisers in Southeast Asia. The management of APSL possesses certain knowledge of investment criteria of OBOR-related investment entities, and provides consulting services to regional consultants and brokers with regard to their efforts to source and promote attractive investment opportunities.
 
After the completion of the Rescission Agreement, ABV HK has been taking over the OBOR-related roles from APSL.
 
Marketing and Sales Efforts, Pricing
 
We engaged a lot of efforts in marketing and sales during 2017, ABV HK entered into two Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) in mid-2017 with two China based companies: Shangdong Rushan Victoria Bay Tourism Development Company Ltd. (“Victoria”) and Zhejiang Zhongmeng United Enterprise Management Shareholding Co. Ltd. (“Zhongmeng UEM”) for developing a Tourism Resort and Organic Pig Farms businesses respectively. See our report on Form 8-K dated August 25, 2017. These two development projects are still in processing to finalize the co-operation Agreement due to the changing policies by the PRC government.
 
In addition, ABV HK entered a consulting project contract with a Hong Kong based Kid-Friendly Restaurant in September 2017 for providing market research and business plan for Hong Kong region as well as expanding business to Asian markets such as Singapore, Taiwan and China. This consulting project has generated a phase 1 revenue of US$25,641 (HK$200,000) in September 2017, and upon its completion of phase 2 in mid-2018, it will generate another revenue of US$38,462 (HK$300,000).
 
Competition
 
We face substantial competition from individuals and entities that seek to invest into Asia. Although we feel that the personal relationships developed by our management and business partners provide us with a competitive advantage in sourcing, analyzing, and approving optimal deals, we compete with corporate strategic investors, financial investors like private equity funds, wealth management offices, high net worth individuals and ultra-high net worth individuals, sovereign wealth funds, and any entities which engage in investment activities in Asia. Our management and the management of ABV HK compete primarily on the basis of reputation for honest and thoughtful business practices, as well as quality of network and strategic relationships.
Intellectual Property and Other Contracts
 
We do not have any patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements, or labor contracts.

Employees
 
We have four paid full-time employees who provide services on an at-will basis.
