Corporate History
On October 1, 2016, Honeywell International Inc. (“Honeywell”) completed the separation of AdvanSix. The separation was completed by Honeywell distributing (the "Distribution") all of the then outstanding shares of common stock of AdvanSix on October 1, 2016 (the “Distribution Date”) through a dividend in kind of AdvanSix common stock, par value $0.01 per share, to holders of Honeywell common stock as of the close of business on the record date of September 16, 2016 who held their shares through the Distribution Date (the “Spin-Off”).
Description of Business
AdvanSix Inc. plays a critical role in global supply chains, innovating and delivering essential products for our customers in a wide variety of end markets and applications that touch people’s lives, such as building and construction, fertilizers, plastics, solvents, packaging, paints, coatings, adhesives and electronics. Our reliable and sustainable supply of quality products emerges from the vertically integrated value chain of our three U.S.-based manufacturing facilities. AdvanSix strives to deliver best-in-class customer experiences and differentiated products in the industries of nylon solutions, chemical intermediates and plant nutrients, guided by our core values of Safety, Integrity, Accountability and Respect. Our four key product lines are as follows:
•Nylon – We sell our Nylon 6 resin globally, primarily under the Aegis® brand name. Nylon 6 is a polymer resin, which is a synthetic material used by our customers to produce fibers, filaments, engineered plastics and films that, in turn, are used in such end-products as carpets, automotive and electric components, packaging, including food packaging, and other industrial applications. In addition, our Nylon 6 resin is used to produce nylon films which we sell to our customers primarily under the Capran® brand name.
•Caprolactam – Caprolactam is the key monomer used in the production of Nylon 6 resin. We internally polymerize caprolactam into Aegis® Nylon 6 Resins, and we also market and sell the caprolactam that is not consumed internally to customers who use it to manufacture polymer resins to produce nylon fibers, films and other nylon products. Our Hopewell manufacturing facility is one of the world’s largest single-site producers of caprolactam as of December 31, 2021.
•Chemical Intermediates – We manufacture, market and sell a number of other chemical products that are derived from the chemical processes within our integrated supply chain. Most significant is acetone which is used by our customers in the production of adhesives, paints, coatings, solvents, herbicides and engineered plastic resins. Other intermediate chemicals that we manufacture, market and sell include phenol, alpha-methylstyrene (“AMS”), cyclohexanone, oximes (methyl ethyl ketoxime, acetaldehyde oxime and 2-pentanone oxime), cyclohexanol, sulfuric acid, ammonia and carbon dioxide.
•Ammonium Sulfate – Our ammonium sulfate is used by customers as a fertilizer containing nitrogen and sulfur, two key plant nutrients, as an herbicide adjuvant for crop protection, and in several industrial applications. Ammonium sulfate fertilizer is derived from the caprolactam manufacturing process. Because of our Hopewell facility’s size, scale and technology design, we are the world’s largest single-site producer of ammonium sulfate fertilizer as of December 31, 2021. We market and sell ammonium sulfate primarily to North American and South American distributors, farm cooperatives and retailers to fertilize crops.

For information concerning revenues and assets by geographic region, see “Note 3. Revenue” to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Our manufacturing process is vertically integrated. We use cumene, a chemical compound produced from benzene and propylene, to manufacture phenol, acetone and AMS at our Frankford, Pennsylvania plant. The majority of the phenol we manufacture is further processed at our Hopewell facility through an integrated series of unit operations, which also consume natural gas and sulfur, to produce caprolactam and ammonium sulfate. In 2021, approximately 56% of the caprolactam we have produced at our facility in Hopewell, Virginia has been shipped to our facility in Chesterfield, Virginia where it has been polymerized into Aegis® Nylon 6 resins.
Our integrated manufacturing process, scale and the quantity and range of our products make us one of the most reliable and efficient manufacturers in our industry. We consistently focus on and invest in improving production yields from our various manufacturing processes to build on our leading cost position. Our global logistics infrastructure enables a reliable intra-plant supply chain and consistent and timely delivery to our customers. In addition, we strive to understand the product applications and end-markets into which our products are sold, which helps us upgrade the quality, chemical properties and packaging of our products in ways which enable us to attract price premiums and greater demand.
We serve approximately 400 customers globally located in approximately 50 countries. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we had sales of $1,685 million, $1,158 million and $1,297 million with net income of $140 million, $46 million and $41 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our international sales were $302 million, $267 million and $240 million, respectively.
AdvanSix is a single operating segment and a single reportable segment, operating through three integrated U.S.-based manufacturing sites located in Frankford, Pennsylvania and Hopewell and Chesterfield, Virginia. The Company's headquarters is located in Parsippany, New Jersey.
Competitive Strengths
Low Cost Position Driven by Integrated Manufacturing Footprint, Large Scale, Favorable Geographical Location, and High Utilization Rates. Our vertically integrated manufacturing facilities, scale, access to lower cost raw materials, and high plant utilization rates help us maintain our position as the world’s lowest cost producer of caprolactam. First, we are vertically integrated into several key feedstock materials necessary to produce caprolactam, particularly phenol, ammonia and oleum/sulfuric acid, which we believe is a unique advantage in our industry. Our integration contributes to higher operating margins by lowering raw material transportation, handling and storage costs. It also allows us to remain flexible, while optimizing sales from our diverse portfolio of products. Second, we operate one of the world’s largest single-site caprolactam and ammonium sulfate production facilities, which is a competitive advantage in our fragmented industry. Our scale provides operating leverage and the opportunity to achieve stronger business performance than our competitors in several ways. Most fundamentally, it enables us to spread fixed and overhead costs across more pounds of production, thereby enabling us to produce caprolactam at a lower per pound cost than our competitors, as well as benefiting our procurement activities for raw materials and services. In addition, we believe that our size and scale serves to retain and attract customers who prioritize security of supply. Third, the location of our manufacturing operations in the United States affords us access to the world’s lowest cost natural gas, which is a key raw material needed to manufacture the ammonia used in the production of caprolactam and ammonium sulfate as well as the source of energy for our manufacturing operations. By contrast, a significant number of our competitors are in geographic locations where energy prices are currently substantially higher. Our footprint also provides access to a number of higher value end markets across our product lines. Finally, our long-term customer relationships and contracts enable us to maintain high plant utilization rates, which, along with our large scale, provide significant operating and purchasing leverage.
Diverse Revenue Sources from the Sale of Fertilizer, Acetone and Other Chemical Intermediates. Due to our specific chemical manufacturing processes, vertical integration and scale, we produce ammonium sulfate fertilizer, acetone and a wide range of other chemical intermediates that enable us to diversify our revenue sources. Most significantly, for every pound of caprolactam produced, we produce approximately four pounds of ammonium sulfate, a fertilizer used by farmers around the world. For the past two decades, we have employed agronomists to educate growers and retailers in the Americas on the yield value of using ammonium sulfate fertilizer on key crops including corn, wheat, coffee, sugar, cotton and rice. We have also diversified and optimized our ammonium sulfate-based offerings to include spray-grade adjuvant to support crop protection, as well as other specialty fertilizers and products for industrial use. Sales of ammonium sulfate in 2021 were $401 million and represented 24% of our total sales. We are among the most significant suppliers of acetone to a variety of end-markets in North America. Sales of acetone in 2021 were approximately $294 million and represented 17% of our total sales. In addition to fertilizer and acetone, other products from our manufacturing process include high-purity phenol, AMS, cyclohexanone, oximes, cyclohexanol, sulfuric acid, ammonia and carbon dioxide. The diversity of our sales portfolio helps to mitigate, to some extent, the cyclicality in our end-markets. Currently, we not only have leading positions across these diverse product lines, but are also aligned to several favorable macro trends that are supporting growth across the portfolio including urbanization and aging infrastructure, digital transformation, global food production and resource scarcity, and a shift to green and performance chemicals. 
Global Reach. The global reach of our sales and marketing capabilities enables us to compete everywhere nylon resin, caprolactam, ammonium sulfate and chemical intermediates are consumed. In 2021, approximately 18% of our sales were outside the United States. Our freight and logistics capabilities and terminal locations position us well to serve global markets, including the dock and loading facility at our Hopewell facility which serves ocean-going dry-bulk freight vessels. Our global reach enables us to arbitrage geographic price variations to ensure we are receiving the highest value for our products.
Technical Know-How, Customer Intimacy and Application Development Capabilities. Intimate knowledge of our customers and end-market applications, combined with our technical know-how, enables us to develop differentiated products that are often valued higher by customers compared to commodity products. We have a Research and Development ("R&D") department consisting of scientists and engineers with degrees in polymer and chemical synthesis, catalysis and chemical engineering, who work not only on developing new products for nylon resins but also driving unique offerings for our chemical intermediates and ammonium sulfate customers. Our R&D team has expanded our capabilities to test and scale production of copolymer Nylon 6/66 resin, which is used in food packaging films and other applications. Our agronomists provide the latest scientific information on the importance of sulfur nutrition for crops and how to optimize the benefits of ammonium sulfate fertilizer to our global customers through a variety of channels including webinars, technical training sessions for retailers and direct grower meetings. Further, members of our technical 
marketing team, representing each of our major product lines, present at various industry events and conferences to demonstrate our breadth of product offerings and capabilities.
Business Strategies
Operational Excellence and Improving Through-Cycle Profitability. Through our vertical integration, size, access to low-cost raw materials, and high utilization rates, we seek to build on our low-cost leadership position and expand operating margins by reducing our Nylon 6 resin, caprolactam, ammonium sulfate and other chemical intermediate production costs. Our focus on operational excellence and ongoing productivity improvements concentrate on the following:
•Increasing production volume through asset reliability, flexibility and capacity;
•Executing planned plant turnarounds and prioritizing replacement maintenance capital investments to mitigate risk and support safe, stable and sustainable operations;
•Investing in intermediate chemical buffer storage capacity to mitigate the unfavorable impact of routine maintenance and unplanned interruptions;
•Energy and direct material initiatives aimed at increasing plant productivity and lowering costs; and
•Procurement processes, competitive bidding and supplier diversification to reduce raw material and indirect costs.
Enhancing Portfolio Resiliency. Our diverse portfolio serves us well particularly during times of uncertainty. Over the past several years, we have invested in capabilities to strengthen our innovation, increase the value of our product portfolio and meet customer specifications in certain high value industries including high-purity applications, high-value intermediates and differentiated nylon. We have had successes across the portfolio including our oximes-based EZ-Blox® anti-skinning agent used in paints and coatings, and our Nadone® cyclohexanone product line, which is a solvent used in various high-value applications. Growing off a small base, we have also seen commercial success with our Nylon-based wire and cable offerings. Supporting our differentiated nylon portfolio, our Chesterfield facility is capable of producing multiple grades of higher value Nylon 6 resin as well as copolymer Nylon 6/66 resin, which are used in engineered plastics for the automotive industry, films for food packaging, as well as other higher value applications. Our customers typically buy nylon resin and caprolactam for compounding or extruding with additives and other materials, to increase strength or flexibility or to add color to make the resin more suitable for use in their end products such as textiles, packaging and industrial materials. We leverage our R&D investments, customer intimacy and knowledge of product applications to develop new resin products to better serve our customers and increase the value of our resin products portfolio. For example, engineered plastics that utilize Nylon 6 and Nylon 66 resin are being increasingly used in automobiles to reduce weight as automobile manufacturers strive to meet stricter fuel efficiency standards. We work with our customers serving this market to develop resin products specifically tailored for these product applications. We are focused on working with customers to solve their needs with respect to sustainability and have received commercial orders for our recently launched 100% Post-Industrial Recycled resins and films. Another focus of our R&D initiatives includes nylon resin processing technologies that can produce existing high value resins at lower costs. Our R&D team works with existing and potential customers to understand end-use applications, build application development capabilities and protect the value proposition of our new products. In addition, as a result of recent efforts and enhancements in crystallizer technology and operations, we are now producing more high-quality granular grade ammonium sulfate to meet the growing demand of our customers.
Strong Capital Stewardship. We have developed and are executing against a multi-year pipeline of high-return growth and cost savings capital projects. These efforts target improvement in production rate, cost, quality and yield. We are focused on improving our return on invested capital and remain disciplined in our approach as we support long-term shareholder value. On an ongoing basis we evaluate options to return cash to shareholders while also pursuing a highly-selective acquisition and alliance strategy to supplement our organic sales by broadening our customer base, developing our technology and product portfolios, expanding our geographic reach and enhancing our cash flow profile and margin stability. In 2021, we completed our first acquisition of certain assets of Commonwealth Industrial Services, Inc. and we initiated a structural return of cash in the form of a quarterly dividend reflecting confidence in our cash flow generation. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of dividends to stockholders, if any, will fall within the sole discretion of our Board of Directors (the "Board").
Industry Overview
Nylon Solutions. Global demand for Nylon 6 resin spans a variety of end-uses such as textiles, engineered plastics, industrial filament, food and industrial films, and carpet. The market growth typically tracks global GDP growth over the long-term but varies by end-use.
Generally, prices for Nylon 6 resin and caprolactam reflect supply and demand in the marketplace as well as the value of the basic raw materials used in the production of caprolactam, consisting primarily of benzene and, depending on the manufacturing process utilized, natural gas and sulfur. The global prices for nylon resin typically track a spread over the price of caprolactam, which in turn tracks as a spread over benzene because the key feedstock materials for caprolactam, phenol or cyclohexane, are derived from benzene. This price spread has historically experienced cyclicality as a result of global changes in supply and demand. Generally, Nylon 6 resin prices track the cyclicality of caprolactam prices, although prices set above the spread are achievable when nylon resin manufacturers, like AdvanSix, formulate and produce differentiated nylon resin products. Our differentiated Nylon 6 products are 
typically valued at a higher level than commodity resin products. We believe that Nylon 6 end-market growth will continue to generally track global GDP over the long-term. Applications such as engineered plastics and packaging have potential to grow at faster rates given certain macrotrends. Additionally, one of our strategies is to continue developing higher-value, differentiated Nylon 6 products, such as our wire and cable, Post-Industrial Recycled resins and films and co-polymer offerings, in current and new customer applications.
The global market for Nylon 6 resin and caprolactam has undergone significant change over the past decade. Following a peak in 2011 through the first half of 2016, nylon and caprolactam prices experienced a cyclical period of downturn as Chinese manufacturers entered the market and increased global supply at a time when demand growth remained relatively stable. As a result of the increased capacity and competitive intensity, industry margins for Nylon 6 resin and caprolactam compressed over this period to a low point in mid-2016. In the second half of 2016, capacity reductions by our competitors occurred in North America and Europe improving supply / demand fundamentals in North America with continued dynamic conditions globally. Industry spreads had fluctuated near marginal producer cost since 2016, but, slowing global growth and soft end-market demand, combined with capacity increases and an uncertain macro environment, pressured pricing and spreads during the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020. In 2021, strong end use demand, combined with industry operational upsets and supply chain disruptions, created an environment for robust performance in Nylon 6. Additionally, buyers have explored using Nylon 6 as a substitution for other resins where applications allow, based on the need for reliable, secure long-term supply and performance needs.
Chemical Intermediates. Chemical intermediates are used as key inputs for a variety of end-market products including construction materials, paints and coatings, packaging and consumer applications. The primary products are acetone, phenol, AMS and cyclohexanone. Acetone and phenol represent approximately 55% and 15%, respectively, of our chemical intermediates sales. Prices for acetone are influenced by its own supply and demand dynamics but can also be influenced by the underlying move in propylene input costs. In the U.S., where we primarily sell our acetone, there were elevated levels of acetone imports during 2018 and 2019 given high industry operating rates globally, which pressured regional pricing and spreads. As a result of strong global acetone demand driven by favorable COVID-related acetone derivative drivers (hand sanitizers and acrylic screens) in addition to the implementation of acetone anti-dumping duties, acetone imports into the U.S. declined through 2020 and 2021, creating more favorable supply and demand conditions for the product and improved pricing. Industry operating rates improved in the second half of 2021 supporting a balancing of supply and demand and moderation in acetone industry spreads relative to recent highs. Supply and demand conditions for the remaining intermediates we sell are generally balanced or favorable.
Plant Nutrients. Ammonium sulfate fertilizer products are primarily sold in North and South America. Ammonium sulfate is used as a fertilizer providing the key nutrients of sulfur and nitrogen for major agricultural crops globally such as corn, wheat, coffee, sugar, cotton and rice. As of December 31, 2021, ammonium sulfate fertilizer accounts for approximately 6% of the global market for nitrogen fertilizer and over 40% of the global market for sulfur fertilizer. Global prices for ammonium sulfate are influenced by several factors including the price of urea, which is the most widely used source of nitrogen-based fertilizer in the world. Other global factors driving ammonium sulfate fertilizer demand are general agriculture trends, including the price of crops. Our ammonium sulfate product is positioned with the added value proposition of sulfur nutrition to increase yields of key crops. In addition, due to its nutrient density, the typical ammonium sulfate product delivers pound for pound the most readily available sulfur and nitrogen to crops than other fertilizers. During 2020, we expanded our offering to directly supply packaged ammonium sulfate to customers, primarily in North and South America, and diversified and optimized our offerings to include spray-grade adjuvant to support crop protection, as well as other specialty fertilizers and products for industrial use.
Competition
Competition across our product offerings is based on a variety of factors including price, reliability of supply, product innovation, and quality. Other competitive factors include breadth of product line, R&D efforts and technical and managerial capability. While the competitive position of our individual products varies, we believe we are a significant competitor in each major product class. AdvanSix competes with integrated manufacturers, such as Highsun Group Holdings Ltd., BASF Corporation, Sinopec Limited, DOMO Chemicals GmbH, LANXESS AG and Ube Industries, Ltd. We also compete with synthetic manufacturers of ammonium sulfate, such as Pasadena Commodities International and Nutrien Ltd.; and stand-alone phenol and acetone producers, such as Ineos and Altivia. A number of our products are sold in markets with many competitors, some of whom have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. Additionally, our competitors include companies with global operations as well as those operating only within specific geographic regions.
Product Overview
Nylon and Caprolactam
We manufacture our Nylon 6 resin in our Chesterfield plant. We sell our Nylon 6 resin globally, primarily under the Aegis® brand name. In addition, we sell our Nylon 6 resin to a nylon film producer from whom we purchase films to sell to our customers under the 
Capran® brand name. In 2021, our Nylon products generated $423 million of sales. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, Nylon sales were 25%, 24% and 27% of our total sales, respectively.
We produce caprolactam, the key monomer used in the production of Nylon 6 resin, at our Hopewell plant using phenol produced at our Frankford plant and sulfur and natural gas obtained from third-party suppliers. In 2021, caprolactam generated $316 million of sales. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, caprolactam sales were 19%, 19% and 22% of our total sales, respectively.
Chemical Intermediates
We produce and sell chemical intermediates to a range of customers for use in many different types of end-products. In 2021, our chemical intermediates generated $545 million of sales, of which $443 million, or 81%, came from sales of acetone, phenol and cyclohexanone, and $102 million, or 19%, came from sales of our other chemical intermediates. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, sales of chemical intermediates were 32%, 32% and 28% of our total sales, respectively.
The phenol we produce at our Frankford plant is a key chemical intermediate used in our caprolactam manufacturing process. Approximately 80% of the phenol we produce is used in production of caprolactam and other chemical intermediates at Hopewell, and approximately 20% of our phenol is sold to customers for use in their product applications such as resins, epoxies and Bisphenol A.
All our acetone is sold to customers for use in end-products such as adhesives, paints, coatings, solvents, herbicides and engineered plastic resins. Acetone is typically used by our customers as a key raw material in the production of a variety of other chemicals which are then used in the applications listed above.
We also produce and sell cyclohexanone, AMS, oximes and cyclohexanol. We use some of these products in our manufacturing process and sell some to customers for use in end-products such as resins, inks, paints, coatings and agricultural chemical intermediates and electronic components.
Ammonium Sulfate
Ammonium sulfate fertilizer is produced simultaneously with caprolactam as part of our integrated caprolactam manufacturing process at our Hopewell plant. We manufacture this product in a ratio of approximately four pounds of ammonium sulfate to one pound of caprolactam. Our competitors typically produce approximately two pounds or less of ammonium sulfate for each pound of caprolactam. We are targeting conversion of approximately 65% of the ammonium sulfate we produce in higher-value granular form. We sell ammonium sulfate under the brand name Sulf-N®, and in 2021, our ammonium sulfate products generated $401 million of sales. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, ammonium sulfate sales were 24%, 25% and 23% of our total sales, respectively.
Raw Materials
The primary raw material used in our manufacturing process is cumene, which is produced from benzene and propylene. We purchase cumene from multiple suppliers to ensure stability of supply and optimal terms. Other important raw materials used in our manufacturing process are natural gas and sulfur, which are used to produce caprolactam and ammonium sulfate. We purchase natural gas and sulfur from a diverse set of suppliers.
Historically, we have been able to renew contracts with our suppliers and obtain sufficient quantities of cumene, sulfur, natural gas and any other key raw materials. Global supply and demand can significantly impact the price of our key raw materials, and historically prices have been cyclical. We mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk primarily through the use of medium and long-term, formula-based price contracts with our suppliers and formula-based price agreements with customers.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
We have a global sales force with long-standing customer relationships and deep expertise with our products, product applications and end-markets. We predominantly sell directly to our customers, primarily under contracts but also through spot transactions under purchase orders and through distributors.
Our products are supported by our global logistics capability that we employ to ensure reliable and timely delivery to our customers while maximizing distribution resources and efficiency.
Customers
Globally, we serve approximately 400 customers in a wide variety of industries located in approximately 50 countries. In 2021, the Company's 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 40% of total sales. Our largest customer is Shaw Industries Group Inc. 
("Shaw"), one of the world's largest consumers of caprolactam and Nylon 6 resin. We sell caprolactam and Nylon 6 resin to Shaw under a long-term agreement. Sales to Shaw were 12% of our total sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, 14% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 22% for the year ended December 31, 2019. We typically sell to our other customers under master services agreements, with primarily one-year terms, or by purchase orders. We have historically experienced low customer turnover.
Seasonality
We produce ammonium sulfate fertilizer continuously throughout the year as part of our manufacturing process, but quarterly sales fluctuate based on the timing and length of the growing seasons in North and South America. North America ammonium sulfate prices are typically strongest during second quarter fertilizer application and then typically decline seasonally with new season fill in the third quarter. Due to the ammonium sulfate fertilizer sales cycle, we occasionally build up higher inventory balances because our production is continuous and not tied to seasonal demand for fertilizers. Sales of most of our other products have generally been subject to minimal, or no, seasonality.
Research & Development and Intellectual Property
We believe success in our industry is driven not only by operational excellence and cost position but also through technological strength and innovation. Our R&D activities focus on improving our chemical manufacturing processes to increase efficiency, capacity, productivity, and lowering our production and operating costs, as well as innovating and developing new product applications.
We benefit from numerous patents and trademarks that we own. We sell our Nylon 6 resin under the Aegis® brand name, our nylon films under the Capran® brand name and our ammonium sulfate fertilizer under the Sulf-N® brand name. Chemical intermediates are sold under the brand names of Nadone®, Naxol® and EZ-Blox™. We also benefit from technology covered by trade secrets, including know-how and other proprietary information relating to many of our products, processes and technologies. We do not consider any individual patent, trademark or licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our overall business. In our judgment, our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We intend to continue taking steps as necessary to protect our intellectual property, including when appropriate, filing patent applications for inventions that are deemed important to our business.
In 2021, we conducted R&D at technology centers with researchers at our sites in Frankford, Pennsylvania and Chesterfield, Virginia where our former Colonial Heights R&D facility relocated in early 2020 enabling an improved configuration of our labs to drive productivity, increased connectivity with our resin manufacturing and more effective collaboration with customers.
Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental impact, and any resulting financial liability. Some risk of environmental impact is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.
We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. It is possible that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws, standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances.
Among other environmental laws and regulations, we are subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and similar state, foreign and global laws for management and remediation of hazardous materials; the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, for protection of air and water resources; the Toxic Substance Control Act (“TSCA”), for regulation of chemicals in commerce and reporting of potential known adverse effects. There are also numerous other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing materials transport and packaging, under which we may be designated as a potentially responsible party liable for cleanup costs associated with current operating sites and various hazardous waste sites.
Our business may be impacted by potential climate change legislation, regulation or international treaties or accords in the foreseeable future. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.
Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in “Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. We continuously seek to improve our health, safety and 
environmental performance. We have expended funds to comply with environmental laws and regulations and expect to continue to do so.
Our Frankford and Hopewell facilities are regulated facilities under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”) due to the nature of our operations and the proximity of the facilities to adjacent waterways. As a result, we are required to comply with numerous regulations administered by the Department of Homeland Security, including the development and implementation of compliant security procedures and protocols. Additionally, sales of acetone, which is a List II Chemical under the TSCA, are regulated by the Drug Enforcement Act. This classification subjects us to audits by the Drug Enforcement Administration and ongoing restrictions on our sales activities with respect to acetone.
See “Risk Factors – Extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our operations, including initiatives related to discharges into the air and water, hazardous waste, sustainability, global warming and climate change, may result in substantial costs and unanticipated loss or liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” in Item 1A.

AdvanSix has demonstrated its commitment to the Responsible Care® Guiding Principles, which encourage ethical leadership, product safety, a culture which reduces and manages process safety risk, reduction of pollution and waste, and continuous improvement in environmental, health, safety and security performance.
As an organization, we maintain a relentless focus on continuous improvement and our expectation is zero injuries for employees and contractors. Our CARE program — Courage to Act, Respond and Engage — was launched in 2019 and inspires us to Live Safety in 
all we do. We use the industry standard Total Case Incident Rate ("TCIR") to measure our ongoing safety performance and compare with benchmarks. TCIR is defined as the number of occupational injuries and illnesses per 100 employees. Our TCIR was 0.48 in 2021, 0.91 in 2020 and 0.86 in 2019.
In the first quarter of 2020, the Company began executing its business continuity plans with dedicated teams chartered to proactively implement measures to mitigate COVID-19 impacts while continuing to operate all of its manufacturing facilities to meet customer demand. In response to COVID-19, the Company took many actions to protect its employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders and surrounding communities including, but not limited to: (i) 100% thermal screening process at all facilities and restrictions on non-essential visitors; (ii) telecommuting across all sites, where possible; (iii) prohibiting all non-essential domestic and international business travel; (iv) establishing social distancing while limiting the number of employees in control rooms, labs and in-person meetings; and (v) maintaining policies and practices consistent with CDC and government guidelines including upgraded personal protective equipment, face coverings at all facilities, and exposure management protocols. Our telecommuting policies have been designed to allow for continued operation of non-production business-critical functions, including financial reporting systems and internal controls. The Company has protocols in place at all sites, including on-site medical personnel at manufacturing facilities to actively monitor employees and contractors who report symptoms of or exposure to COVID-19. In addition, the Company has trained a contingent workforce to operate the plants as part of its business continuity planning. The Company continued its execution of these measures at all sites through the end of 2021 and intends to continue to do so through the duration of the pandemic.
Equity, Diversity and Inclusion
At AdvanSix, we strive for an inclusive work environment that fosters respect for all our coworkers, customers, suppliers and business partners. We value the diversity reflected in the various backgrounds, experiences, and ideas of our employees, contractors, and other stakeholders. Our Equity, Diversity and Inclusion purpose statement reflects our journey to be our customers' trusted partner for Advantaged Chemistries by caring, innovating and advancing together. To achieve that togetherness, we strive to represent the communities in which we operate, celebrate our differences, inspire belonging, and be tenacious in our pursuit of bringing out the best in people both individually and collectively. Our Code of Conduct outlines our commitment to provide employees a workplace that is free from discrimination or harassment (specifically related to gender, race, disability, ethnicity, nationality, religion and sexual orientation) or personal behavior not conducive to a productive work climate. We believe it is important that each employee feels a sense of belonging and valued as part of the organizational culture we are cultivating, and we feel it is important that each employee sees diverse representation across our AdvanSix team. 
AdvanSix joined hundreds of companies in signing the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion pledge in 2019, which centers around three main commitments: to have complex discussions about diversity and inclusion, implement and expand upon unconscious bias education and share diversity and inclusion practices. We supported this commitment through 2021 as we engaged in honest and transparent conversations with our employees. AdvanSix also seeks to improve gender equality in the manufacturing industry, starting with supporting science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education and work in related fields. A group of employees formed Supporting Women in Manufacturing (SWiM), an AdvanSix Employee Resource Group, with the goal of promoting women in manufacturing, female leadership and growth in STEM-related fields. SWiM seeks to raise awareness on these matters through programs, events and discussions, including networking, professional development, outreach, volunteering and internal programs highlighting leadership and career paths in multiple disciplines. AdvanSix is committed to pay equity for its employees and regularly performs reviews of its compensation practices to evaluate and maintain pay equity in several respects, including by gender, ethnicity and race.
At a national level, AdvanSix not only participates as a board member, but is a patron level supporter of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers’ ("AIChE") “Doing a World of Good” initiative that actively supports five high priority pillars within the chemical engineering field that align closely with sustainability and ESG principles including equity, diversity and inclusion. In addition, AdvanSix has supported and participated in the Future of STEM Scholars Initiative ("FOSSI"), a national, industry-wide program which provides scholarships to students pursuing STEM degrees at Historically Black Colleges and Universities ("HBCU") and connections to internships, leadership development and mentoring opportunities. During 2021, we welcomed our first class of FOSSI scholars all of whom are in attendance at HBCUs.
During 2021, we introduced a number of key actions to advance equity, diversity and inclusion within the organization including focus group discussions, review of our talent pipeline and overall development programs. Notably, we further enhanced our recruiting processes by implementing a program mandating a diverse candidate slate with the goal to increase our organization’s workforce diversity and improve outreach in the local communities where we operate. In addition, we continued unconscious bias training at leadership and managerial levels enterprise-wide to enhance our recruitment efforts and the evaluation process of candidates. We conducted Days of Understanding at our largest manufacturing facility throughout the month of June to encourage active engagement by leadership with all employees to listen to their experiences and gather feedback for improvement.
Our senior leadership team was comprised of over 50% women in 2021, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, Chief Information Officer, Vice President, Nylon Solutions and Vice President, Business Development. Four directors of our ten-member Board are women, and two directors of our ten-member Board are ethnically diverse.
Employee Development
AdvanSix seeks to attract the best talent from a diverse range of sources in order to meet the needs of our business now and in the future. We have established strong relationships with community colleges, universities, professional associations and industry groups with a focus on technical positions and development in order to attract talent including by utilizing co-op, internship programs and university relations as a talent pipeline. Early career development and continual learning is part of our employee engagement strategy. To support the advancement of our employees, we promote development through training that broadens work-related skills and believe that the most effective model combines an “experience, exposure, and education” approach. We acknowledge that learning is a career-long endeavor and place the greatest emphasis on learning by doing, supported by feedback, training, and self-reflection.
AdvanSix promotes development through training that broadens work-related skills. These include:
•Core competencies for all employees to develop and apply
•Leadership competencies needed by all employees managing people
•Functional competencies that are position specific and used to inform job progression
We support the continued development of our employees through semi-annual performance and development reviews, including annual enterprise-wide talent development assessments. We conduct safety and environmental training modules for new employees as part of Health, Safety and Environmental ("HSE") orientation, along with job-specific training aligned to roles. We have instituted an initiative to empower our First Line Supervisors ("FLS") to be HSE leaders within our organization including serving as decision makers and chief communicators on shift, while developing, coaching and mentoring their shift teammates. On an annual basis, senior leadership recognizes the FLS who demonstrates excellence with this initiative with an FLS of the Year Award. During 2021, we held a Technical Career Progression event in order to recognize those employees who have displayed technical capability and regularly deliver in three key areas — results, behaviors and capability.
A highly trained and engaged workforce is essential for AdvanSix to be our customers’ trusted partner, and those partnerships are built by delivering best-in-class experiences that result in satisfied customers and support shareholder return.
Employee Benefits 
Our compensation programs are designed to align employee compensation with Company performance and to provide appropriate incentives in order to attract, retain and motivate our employees. We believe that in order to maintain the strength of our workforce, it is critical to monitor and assess the current business environment and labor market to refine our compensation and benefits programs and other resources available to our employees. We seek to offer compensation that is competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience and geographic location. In addition to offering competitive base salaries, AdvanSix structures its compensation programs to balance incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance.
Our compensation and benefit programs are designed to support our business strategy through four key objectives:
•Attract and retain world-class talent;
•Drive and pay for performance that creates superior results and sustainable stockholder value;
•Manage risk through oversight and sound management; and
•Nurture a culture of employee health and wellness.
