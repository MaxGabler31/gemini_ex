ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise indicates, all references to the words "Scientific Games," "we," "us," "our" and the "Company" refer to SGC and its consolidated subsidiaries. Any references to "Notes" refers to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
General
SGC was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July 2, 1984. On September 18, 2017, SGC entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with SG Nevada Merger Company, a Nevada corporation and SGC’s wholly owned subsidiary (“Newco”), providing for the merger of SGC with and into Newco with Newco surviving the merger (the “Surviving Corporation”), for the sole purpose of changing SGC’s state of incorporation from Delaware to Nevada (the “reincorporation merger”). The reincorporation merger was approved by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of outstanding shares of Class A common stock of SGC entitled to vote thereon at a special meeting of SGC’s stockholders on November 27, 2017. On January 10, 2018, the reincorporation merger was consummated. Following the consummation of the reincorporation merger, each outstanding share of Class A common stock of SGC, par value $0.01 per share, automatically converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, par value $.001 per share. The reincorporation merger did not result in any change in SGC’s name, headquarters, business, management, location of offices, assets, liabilities or net worth, other than as a result of the costs incident to the reincorporation merger.  Our management, including all directors and officers, immediately prior to the reincorporation merger remained the same immediately following the reincorporation merger and assumed identical positions with the Surviving Corporation.
 We are a leading developer of technology-based products and services and associated content for the worldwide gaming, lottery and interactive gaming industries. Our portfolio includes gaming machines and game content, casino-management systems, table game products and services, instant and draw-based lottery games, lottery systems, lottery content and services, interactive gaming (including sports betting technology) and social casino solutions and other products and services. We also gain access to technologies and pursue global expansion through strategic acquisitions and equity investments. 
On January 5, 2018, we successfully completed the NYX acquisition. See Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Notes 9, 13 and 16, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on acquisitions completed during fiscal 2017 and the NYX acquisition. At the end of fiscal 2017, we reported our operations in three business segments - Gaming, Lottery and Interactive. As a result of the NYX acquisition (see Note 9) and starting with the first quarter 2018 reporting period, we will report our operations in four business segments, representing our different products and services: Gaming, Lottery, Social and Digital. 
Strategy
We strive to provide high quality products and services to our customers across all three of our business segments -- Gaming, Lottery and Interactive.
To this end, we are focused on the following strategies:

• | Drive innovation— We place great emphasis on producing innovative and high-performing Gaming, Lottery and Interactive content, products and services that provide differentiated value to our customers. We seek to leverage our expansive content library and portfolio of proprietary and licensed intellectual property, and use our extensive player and customer research in order to bring innovation to our products, services and processes. We believe that following the closing of the NYX acquisition in January 2018, we are well positioned to lead the digital transformation of gaming, as we expect the combination will create a broad, end-to-end portfolio offering of advanced technologies.


• | Focus on prudent fiscal management to improve financial returns and cash flow from operations— Setting the right operational and strategic priorities to support our customers, aligning our resources to achieve our targets and tracking our performance is our near term focus. All of these factors, if successful, should increase our cash flow from operations available to reduce our financial leverage.


• | Build a corporate culture open to new ideas and opportunities that help to accelerate deleveraging— We are creating a culture of discipline that aligns and uses our resources more effectively, and at the same time cultivates open minds willing to capitalize on additional opportunistic situations where we might be able to accelerate our deleveraging efforts.

Segments
8

At the end of fiscal 2017, we reported our operations in three business segments (Gaming, Lottery and Interactive), representing our different products and services. See " Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Segment Results" in Part II, Item 7, and Notes 2 and 3, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional business segment information, including the segment reporting change effective first quarter of 2018 as a result of the NYX acquisition, the types of products and services from which our segments derive their revenues, certain financial information relating to our segments, including segment revenue, operating income (loss) and total assets for the last three fiscal years, and certain financial information relating to our revenue derived from and assets located in the U.S. and other geographic areas for the last three fiscal years.
Our foreign operations are subject to a variety of risks. These risks are discussed further under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A and under “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, the specific translation impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the British Pound Sterling, the Euro and the Australian Dollar, on our consolidated financial statements are further discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Gaming Segment
The gaming industry is characterized by the continuous development of new technologies, products and game content. Gaming products and services are used by a diverse group of gaming operators and U.S. and international lotteries which may offer VLTs and other forms of gaming, such as bingo and sports wagering.
Our products are installed in all of the major regulated U.S. gaming jurisdictions, and in approximately 176 international gaming jurisdictions. Growth of gaming in land-based venues is driven by the opening of new casinos in both new and existing jurisdictions and the expansion of existing casinos. In addition, the land-based gaming supply business is significantly impacted by the rate at which casinos and other gaming operators replace their gaming machines, which depends on a number of factors, including their capital budgets. Virtually all sectors of the gaming industry are impacted by changes in economic conditions that impact players’ disposable incomes.    
A substantial portion of our U.K. gaming business benefits from contracts with two of the large U.K. bookmakers (two entities that subsequently merged and formed Ladbrokes Coral Group), which represent a significant portion of our U.K. LBO server-based gaming business. These contracts are discussed under “Business Segment Results-Gaming” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition 
The gaming machine sector is highly competitive and is characterized by the continuous introduction of new games, gaming machines and related technologies. We compete primarily with Ainsworth Game Technology, Aristocrat Leisure Ltd., ("Aristocrat"), Aruze Gaming America, Inc., Everi Games Inc. (formerly known as Multimedia Games, Inc. and a subsidiary of Everi Holdings Inc.), International Game Technology ("IGT") (a subsidiary of International Game Technology PLC (the successor of Gtech S.p.A)), Inspired Gaming Group Limited, Konami Digital Entertainment, Inc. ("Konami"), and the Novomatic Group of Companies. Our principal direct competitor in our U.K. LBO business is Inspired Gaming Group Limited.
The casino-management systems business is also highly competitive. Product features and functionality, accuracy, reliability, service level and pricing are among the factors that determine how successful systems providers are in selling their systems. Our principal competitors in casino-management systems include Aristocrat, IGT and Konami. Competition for these products is intense due to the number of providers and the limited number of casinos and jurisdictions in which they operate.
With respect to our table products, we compete on the basis of the breadth of our Shuffler products and services and PTGs, product reliability, service, the strength of our intellectual property and our extensive sales, regulatory and distribution channels. Our automated Shufflers also compete against hand shuffling, which remains the most competitive shuffling option for casino card games around the world. Finally, since the need for our Shuffler products depends upon the casino's use of live table games, our Shufflers also compete against any products that live table games compete against.
Competition for PTG content is based on player appeal, brand recognition, price and the strength of the underlying intellectual property. We compete on this basis, and on the strength of our extensive sales, service, marketing and distribution channels. We also compete with non-PTG such as blackjack and baccarat, and several companies that primarily develop and license PTGs such as Galaxy Gaming, Inc. and Masque Publishing, Inc. Finally, some of our product lines may compete against each other for space on the casino floor.

Lottery Segment
There are approximately 180 lotteries throughout the world, operated by U.S. and international governmental authorities and their licensees. Governments typically authorize lotteries as a means of generating revenues without imposing additional taxes. Many jurisdictions have come to rely on the proceeds from lottery game sales as a significant source of funding for programs for which net lottery proceeds are designed to fund. Although there are many types of lottery games worldwide, the two principal categories of products offered are draw lottery games and instant lottery games. Currently, 44 U.S. jurisdictions offer instant game lotteries, and 46 U.S. jurisdictions offer draw lotteries. Lottery operations in international jurisdictions can vary widely depending on the number of new lotteries entering the market, the number of lottery licenses issued within each market and the discontinuance of lotteries and operating licenses.
An instant lottery game is typically played by removing a scratch-off protective coating from a preprinted ticket to reveal if it is a winner. Draw lottery games, such as POWERBALL® and MEGA MILLIONS®, are based on a random selection of a series of numbers, and prizes are generally based on the number of winners who share the prize pool, although set prizes are also offered. Draw lottery games are generally provided through a lottery system in which lottery terminals in retail outlets are continuously connected to a central computer system for the sale and validation of lottery games and related functions. A lottery system may also be used to activate, sell and validate instant lottery games to confirm that a ticket is a winner and prevent duplicate payments. In some jurisdictions, separate instant game validation systems may be installed. 
Lotteries may offer a range of other games. In the U.S., some lotteries offer high frequency games such as keno, which is typically played every four to five minutes in restricted social settings, such as bars, and is usually offered as an extension of the lottery system. 
The table below lists our more significant lottery contracts as of December 31, 2017, representing approximately 35% of our Lottery revenue. Also included are instant or draw lottery game retail sales (as applicable), if publicly available, for each jurisdiction.

(1) Our lottery contracts with U.S. state governmental authorities generally contain termination for convenience clauses, which may be exercised at the election of state government.
(2) In December 2017, LNS accepted a contract extension of up to nine years for the Italian Scratch and Win concession.
Competition 
The instant lottery game sector is highly competitive and continues to be subject to intense price-based competition. Our principal instant games competitors in the U.S. are IGT and Pollard Banknote Limited. Internationally, a number of instant lottery game vendors compete with us including the competitors noted above and diversified printers in India, China and Latin America. Our principal competitors in the supply of lottery-related licensed games, promotional entertainment and loyalty or rewards programs are Alchemy3 LLC, ePrize LLC, IGT, Intralot S.A. and Pollard Banknote Limited.
The lottery systems business is also highly competitive and continues to be subject to intense price-based competition. Our principal competitors in this business are IGT, Intralot S.A. and Tattersalls Group. We also compete with various suppliers of lottery system components, such as terminals and computer systems, and lottery operators that internally develop their own systems.
As countries liberalize gaming regulations, lotteries may expand their scope by offering sports wagering, gaming machines, interactive gaming or other forms of gaming, which may introduce new suppliers that compete with us for lottery customers. In some jurisdictions, the liberalization of gaming regulations has included the privatization or outsourcing of all or a portion of the lottery operations via a competitive bidding process. We believe Camelot Group plc, IGT, Intralot, S.A. and the Tattersalls Group to be among those competitors who may also bid on such opportunities.
10

Interactive Segment
Our Interactive business segment includes social (non-wagering) gaming and interactive RMG. Through our Interactive segment, we make available WMS®, Bally®, SHFL®, Barcrest®, Bingo ShowdownTM and third-party branded content directly to players of social gaming, or-in the case of RMG-directly to online casino operators. Our SG Universe® service features multiple platforms which enable land-based casinos to increase engagement with their players. Our Interactive business is focused on products and services that operate on both mobile and desktop products and platforms.
Competition
In our social gaming business, we compete for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers with other interactive gaming entertainment companies that offer social casino games and other entertainment services. Our primary social casino games competitors include Big Fish Games Inc. (a subsidiary of Aristocrat), DoubleU Games, GSN/Bash Gaming, Playtika (acquired by a group of investors led by Shanghai Giant Network Technology Co. in 2016), Product Madness (a subsidiary of Aristocrat) and Zynga Inc. Our primary video game competitors outside of social casino games providers include Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Kabam, King, Zynga, and Supercell. In our RMG business, our primary competitors are IGT, Microgaming Software Systems Ltd., Net Entertainment, and Playtech Limited.
Research and Development 
We believe our ability to attract new Gaming, Lottery and Interactive customers and retain existing customers depends in part on our ability to evolve and continue to develop our product line by continually developing differentiating products, hardware and systems technology and functionality to enhance player entertainment and customer profitability. We are also focused on expanding use of the internet and other interactive technologies to increase play. Our gaming machines are usually designed and programmed by our internal engineering staff and internal and external game development studios with the input and cooperation of our customers. 
We have Gaming R&D personnel located in our Las Vegas, Nevada and Chicago, Illinois facilities. A large portion of our Lottery R&D team is based in our Alpharetta, Georgia facilities. We have Interactive personnel located primarily in Chicago, Illinois; Cedar Falls, Iowa; Austin, Texas; and Tel Aviv, Israel. We also have game development studios in Las Vegas, Nevada, Sydney, Australia, Manchester, England and India (including Bangalore, Chennai and Pune), with additional R&D staff in other locations, including Reno, Nevada and Vienna, Austria. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our R&D expense totaled $184.1 million, $204.8 million and $183.9 million, respectively. 
Intellectual Property
Many of our products use intellectual property rights, including trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, patents and trade secrets. We consider our intellectual property rights to be, in the aggregate, material to our business. We protect our investment in R&D by seeking intellectual property protection as appropriate for our technologies and content. We also acquire and license intellectual property from third parties.
The terms of our patents vary based on the date and jurisdiction of filing. The term of U.S. patents generally expires 20 years from the date of filing of the first non-provisional patent application in a family of patents. The actual protection afforded by a patent depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the applicable country. Certain technologies, which are material to our businesses, are the subject of patents issued and patent applications currently pending in the U.S. and certain other countries. Our Lottery business uses our patented and patent-pending technologies in the production, secure printing, validation and distribution of instant lottery games. Our Gaming and Interactive businesses use our patented and patent-pending technologies in games and associated platforms and systems. And under a patent cross-licensing agreement with IGT, we can offer games using patented game features from the patent portfolios of other members of IGT’s slot game features pool.
We market many of our products under trademarks and copyrights that provide product differentiation and recognition and promote our portfolio of product offerings. All of our games feature elements subject to copyright rights and protection. In addition, we generally obtain trademark protection and often seek to register trademarks for the names and designs under which we market and license our products and games. Protections for trademarks exist in many countries, including the U.S., for as long as the trademark is registered and/or used. Registrations are generally issued for fixed, but renewable terms, although trademark rights may exist whether or not a mark is registered and the duration of the registrations varies by country.
11

We believe that our use of both our own and third-party licensed brand names and related intellectual property contributes to the appeal and success of our products, and that our future ability to license, acquire or develop new brand names is important to our continued success. Therefore, we continue to invest in the recognition of our brands and brands that we license. Certain of our games are based on popular brands licensed from third parties, such as Hasbro International, Inc., Fremantle Media North America, CBS Studios Inc., Turner Entertainment Co., Warner Bros. Consumer Products Inc., Harley-Davidson, Playboy Enterprises International, Inc., Paramount Pictures Corporation, Hearst Holdings Inc., King Features Syndicate Division, Twentieth Century Fox Licensing and Merchandising, Major League Baseball and National Basketball Association. 
From time to time, we become aware of potential infringement of our intellectual property by competitors and other third parties and consider what action, if any, to take in that regard, including litigation where appropriate. We are also subject to threatened or actual intellectual property-related claims by third parties from time to time.
Production Processes, Sources and Availability of Components 
We currently produce substantially all of our gaming machines at our facilities in Las Vegas and Sydney, Australia. We also have finishing lines in our Barcelona, Spain facility, in Midrand, South Africa; Buenos Aires, Argentina; and Manchester, England. These finishing lines allow for the completion and testing of our gaming machine assemblies from our facilities in Las Vegas. We also refurbish used gaming machines primarily at our Las Vegas facilities.
Manufacturing commitments are generally based on expected quarterly sales orders from customers. Due to uneven order flow from customers, component parts common to all gaming machines are purchased and assembled into partial products that are scheduled for just in time delivery to allow final assembly lead time to meet agreed customer delivery dates. Our gaming machine manufacturing processes generally consist of assembling component parts and sub-assemblies into a complete gaming machine.
Shufflers are assembled in one of our Las Vegas facilities and by a third party near Salzburg, Austria.
Hardware and component parts associated with our casino-management systems are purchased directly from the contract manufacturers and flow through our Las Vegas facilities with some assembly and testing. These parts do not require a significant amount of assembly and are used primarily in systems implementations, which take place at customer locations.    Our dedicated computer-controlled printing process is specifically designed to produce secure instant lottery games. We also have the capability to track instant games from the point of production through delivery to retailers. Instant lottery games are delivered finished and ready for distribution by the lottery authority (or by us under certain contracts). An instant lottery game that has been removed at any point in the distribution chain in an unauthorized manner can be flagged and invalidated in the event that it is used to claim winnings. 
Production of our lottery terminals (and related component products) primarily involves the assembly of electronic and mechanical components into more complex systems and products. Third-party vendors generally manufacture and assemble our lottery terminals. We normally have sufficient lead time between reaching an agreement and the commencement of operations so that we are able to provide our Lottery customers with a fully functioning system that is customized to meet their requirements. We believe that this is consistent with our competitors' lead times and is also consistent with the needs of our customers. We place advance orders for those components that have long lead times in anticipation of firm purchase orders from our customers, provided that the investment in inventory and the risk of the customer order not materializing are deemed acceptable.
We believe we have an adequate supply of component parts and raw materials used in manufacturing our gaming machines and lottery terminals. 
Seasonality
Our results of operations can fluctuate due to seasonal trends and other factors. Sales of our gaming machines to casinos are generally strongest in the spring and slowest in the summer, while revenue from our Participation gaming machines is generally highest in the spring and summer. Player activity in our Interactive business is generally slower in the second and third quarters of the year, particularly during the summer months. See the risk factor captioned "Our results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors, and, therefore, our periodic operating results are not guarantees of future performance" under the heading "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 8,600 persons worldwide, with approximately 4,600 employed domestically and 4,000 employed internationally.
Government Regulation
General
The gaming and lottery industries are generally subject to extensive and evolving regulation that customarily includes some form of licensing or regulatory screening of operators, suppliers, manufacturers and distributors and their applicable affiliates, their major shareholders, officers, directors and key employees. In addition, certain of our gaming products and technologies must be certified or approved in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. Regulators review many facets of an applicant or holder of a license, including its financial stability, integrity and business experience. Any failure to receive a license or the loss of a license that we currently hold could have a material adverse effect on us or on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.
While we believe that we are in compliance with all material gaming and lottery laws and regulatory requirements applicable to us, we cannot assure that our activities or the activities of our customers will not become the subject of any regulatory or law enforcement proceeding or that any such proceeding would not have a material adverse impact on us or our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.
We have developed and implemented a rigorous internal compliance program in an effort to ensure that we comply with legal requirements imposed in connection with our Gaming and Lottery activities, and legal requirements generally applicable to all publicly traded companies. The compliance program is run on a day-to-day basis by our Chief Compliance Officer with legal advice provided by attorneys in our legal and compliance departments and outside experts. The compliance program is overseen by the Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors, which is comprised of employee and non-employee directors and a non-employee gaming law expert. While we are firmly committed to full compliance with all applicable laws, we cannot assure that our compliance program will prevent the violation of one or more laws or regulations, or that a violation by us or an employee will not result in the imposition of a monetary fine or suspension or revocation of one or more of our licenses.
In the EU, various judgments by the Court of Justice of the European Union ("CJEU") have addressed the approaches adopted by certain member states to restrict and/or regulate gaming. Topics addressed in those judgments include the ability of member states to grant, or to maintain, monopolies for gaming and lottery activities and the power of member states to limit access by gaming and/or lottery providers established elsewhere in the EU. Several cases on these subjects are currently pending in the CJEU. However, the European Commission recently dropped all enforcement actions related to gambling in an effort to change the way it enforces EU law. The ramifications of this decision are not clear and the impact on gaming is not known at this time. 
While we believe that we have developed appropriate procedures and policies to comply with the requirements of these evolving laws and legal pronouncements, we cannot assure that our activities or the activities of our customers will not become the subject of law enforcement proceedings or that any such proceedings would not have a material adverse impact on us or our business plans. Furthermore, laws and regulations applicable to lotteries and gaming in U.S. and international jurisdictions are subject to change and the effect of such changes on our ongoing and potential operations cannot be predicted with certainty.
From time to time, we retain government affairs representatives in various U.S. and international jurisdictions to advise elected and appointed officials and the public concerning our views on gaming and lottery-related legislation, and to monitor such legislation and to advise us in our relations with gaming and lottery authorities.
Gaming
We provide our games, gaming machines, gaming systems, table products and related products and services in legal gaming jurisdictions worldwide. The manufacture, distribution, provision and operation of our gaming products and services is subject to regulation and approval by various city, county, state, provincial, federal, tribal and foreign agencies. The primary purposes of these rules are to (1) ensure the responsibility, financial stability and character of the parties involved in these 
13

activities through licensing and registration requirements, (2) ensure the integrity and compliance of our gaming products and services and (3) prohibit the use of gaming products and services at unauthorized locations or for the benefit of undesirable parties.
Typically, gaming regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate are established by statute and are administered by a regulatory agency with broad authority to interpret gaming regulations and to regulate gaming activities. Among other things, gaming authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we are licensed:

• | adopt additional rules and regulations under the implementing statutes;


• | investigate violations of gaming regulations;


• | enforce gaming regulations and impose disciplinary sanctions for violations of such laws, including fines, penalties and revocation of gaming licenses;


• | review the character and fitness of manufacturers, distributors and operators of gaming products and services and make determinations regarding their suitability or qualification for licensure;


• | grant licenses for the manufacture, distribution and operation of gaming products and services;


• | review and approve transactions (such as acquisitions, material commercial transactions, securities offerings and debt transactions); and


• | establish and collect related fees and/or taxes.

We believe we hold all of the licenses and permits necessary to conduct our business. We are authorized to sell, lease or operate our gaming products and services in approximately 449 jurisdictions worldwide (including jurisdictions that do not require licensing), including approximately 176 international gaming jurisdictions.
In addition, a number of U.S. states authorize wagering on VLTs at state regulated and licensed facilities. Although some states restrict VLTs to already existing wagering facilities, others permit these machines to be placed at venues such as bars, restaurants, truck stops and other specifically licensed gaming facilities. In addition, all of the Canadian provinces and various other international jurisdictions have authorized VLTs.
Regulatory requirements vary among jurisdictions, but the majority of jurisdictions require licenses, permits or findings of suitability for our company, individual officers, directors, major stockholders and key employees. Our gaming hardware and software also must be approved either by a gaming authority laboratory or a private laboratory authorized by the gaming authority.
Lottery
Currently, 44 U.S. jurisdictions offer instant game lotteries, and 46 U.S. jurisdictions offer draw lotteries. The operation of lotteries in the U.S. and internationally is subject to extensive regulation. Although certain features of a lottery, such as the percentage of gross revenues that must be paid back to players in prize money, are usually set by legislation, lottery regulatory authorities generally exercise significant discretion, including with respect to the determination of the types of games played, the price of each wager, the manner in which the lottery is marketed and the selection of suppliers of equipment, technology and services and retailers of lottery products.
To ensure the integrity of contract awards and lottery operations, most jurisdictions require detailed background disclosure on a continuous basis from, and conduct background investigations of, vendors and their officers, directors, subsidiaries, affiliates and principal stockholders. Background investigations of the vendors' employees who will be directly responsible for the operation of lottery systems are also generally conducted and most states reserve the right to require the removal of employees who they deem to be unsuitable or whose presence they believe may adversely affect the operational security or integrity of the lottery. Certain jurisdictions also require extensive personal and financial disclosure and background checks from persons and entities that hold a specified percentage (typically five percent or more) of a vendor's securities either legally, beneficially and/or through voting rights. The failure of such holders of our securities to submit to background checks and provide such disclosure could result in the imposition of penalties and could jeopardize the award of a lottery contract to us or provide grounds for termination of an existing lottery contract.
The award of lottery contracts and ongoing operations of lotteries in international jurisdictions are also extensively regulated, although international regulations typically vary from those prevailing in the U.S. Restrictions are frequently 
14

imposed on foreign companies seeking to do business in such jurisdictions and, as a consequence, we have in a number of instances allied ourselves with local companies when seeking international lottery contracts.
Interactive
In the U.S., the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 ("UIGEA") prohibits among other things, the acceptance by a business of a wager by means of the internet where such wager is prohibited by any applicable law where initiated, received or otherwise made. Under UIGEA severe criminal and civil sanctions may be imposed on the owners and operators of such systems and on financial institutions that process wagering transactions. The law contains a safe harbor for wagers placed within a single state (disregarding intermediate routing of the transmission) where the method of placing the bet and receiving the bet is authorized by that state's law, provided the underlying regulations establish appropriate age and location verification.
Within the past few years, state-authorized internet casino gaming has been launched in Delaware and New Jersey and state authorized online poker has been launched in Nevada. A number of other states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation to specifically authorize online poker, online gambling, and sports betting, subject to federal restrictions on sports wagering being lifted. Additionally, two state lotteries offer (and other lotteries are considering offering) internet instant game sales to in-state lottery customers and a number of other states allow subscription sales of draw games over the internet. For example, Pennsylvania recently passed a broad gaming expansion bill, which, among other things, authorized online gambling in the form of slot machines, table games and poker. It also authorized land-based and online sports wagering in the event the federal restrictions on sports wagering are lifted. This new legislation also authorized Pennsylvania's lottery to distribute lottery products, including instant ticket games, through numerous channels including web applications, mobile applications, mobile web, tablets and social media.
There have been various state and federal bills proposed recently in the U.S. to restrict or prohibit interactive gaming and lottery sales. Very significant resources are being devoted to supporting these efforts. Although these efforts have generally not been successful, we cannot assure that laws restricting interactive gaming or lottery sales will not be passed at either the federal or state level. For instance, in May 2015, the Minnesota legislature passed an amendment to the state’s lottery law prohibiting the sale of instant win lottery tickets over the internet. Furthermore, changes in the executive branches of government at the state and federal level could affect federal and state policies on gaming as well. 
In addition, the outcome of a U.S. Supreme Court case argued in December 2017, Governor Christopher J. Christie, et al., v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, et al., may affect state and federal policies with respect to sports wagering. This case is expected to address the question of whether the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, a federal statute enacted to stop the spread of state-sponsored sports gambling, impermissibly commandeers the regulatory power of the states.
To varying degrees, a number of European governments have taken steps to change the regulation of internet wagering through the implementation of new or revised licensing and taxation regimes, some of which include the imposition of sanctions on unlicensed providers. With the recent developments of the European Commission dropping enforcement actions related to gambling, these evolving rules and regulations may change quickly and dramatically. Countries outside Europe and the U.S. have also begun evaluating interactive gaming regulation and an increase in regulated markets outside of the U.S. and Europe is likely to continue. Some of our competitors may be more willing to provide internet wagering in countries where the relevant laws and regulations are unclear or not uniformly enforced, putting us at a competitive disadvantage if we do not provide services related to internet wagering in such countries.
We continue to devote significant attention to monitoring these developments. However, we cannot predict the timing, scope or terms of any state, federal or foreign regulations relating to interactive gaming and lottery sales.
Additional Information Regarding Government Regulations
We are subject to specific gaming requirements in the different jurisdictions in which we operate. For additional information, we have filed a summary of the gaming regulations that govern our businesses as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Exhibit 99.10 (Gaming Regulations). In addition, see "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of risk factors related to gaming, lottery and RMG regulations to which we may be subject.
