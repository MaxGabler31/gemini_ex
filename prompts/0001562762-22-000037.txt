Item 1. Business
Overview

Globus Medical, Inc. (together, as applicable, with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Globus,” “we,” “us” or “our”), headquartered in Audubon, Pennsylvania, is a medical device company that develops and commercializes healthcare solutions whose mission is to improve the quality of life of patients with musculoskeletal disorders. Founded in 2003, Globus is committed to medical device innovation and delivering exceptional service to hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and physicians to advance patient care and improve efficiency. Since inception, Globus has listened to the voice of the surgeon to develop practical solutions and products to help surgeons effectively treat patients and improve lives. 

Globus is an engineering-driven company with a history of rapidly developing and commercializing advanced products and procedures to address treatment challenges. With over 220 product launches across 50 countries worldwide, we offer a comprehensive portfolio of innovative and differentiated technologies that are used to treat a variety of musculoskeletal conditions. Although we manage our business globally within one operating segment, we separate our products into two major categories: Musculoskeletal Solutions and Enabling Technologies.

COVID-19 Update

We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and guidance from domestic and international authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities, regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and we may need to make changes to our business based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. As such, given the dynamic nature of this situation, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the impacts of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future. However, if a resurgence occurs and governments mandate restrictions, including restrictions on elective surgeries, we do expect that it could have a material adverse impact on our revenue growth, operating profit and cash flow, revised payment terms with certain of our customers, and a change in effective tax rate driven by changes in the mix of earnings across the Company’s jurisdictions.

We are focused on navigating the challenges presented by COVID-19 and believe we are in a strong position to continue to sustain and grow our business.

Overall Business

Market

The primary market for our products is the United States (“U.S.”), where we sell our products through a combination of direct sales representatives employed by us and sales representatives employed by our exclusive independent distributors, who distribute our products on our behalf for a commission that is generally based on a percentage of sales. We believe there is significant opportunity to strengthen our position in the U.S. market by increasing the size of our sales force and continuing to add direct and distributor sales representatives in the future.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, international sales accounted for approximately 14.5% of our total sales. Internationally, we sell our products through a combination of direct sales representatives employed by us and exclusive international distributors. We believe there are significant opportunities for us to increase our presence in both existing and new international markets through the continued expansion of our direct and distributor sales forces as well as through the commercialization of additional products.

Strategy

Our goal is to become the market leader in providing innovative solutions to promote healing in patients with musculoskeletal disorders. To achieve this goal, we employ the following business strategies:

Leverage our integrated product development engine. We plan to continue developing new products, using the capabilities of our product development engine. We believe our team-oriented and highly integrated development approach, active surgeon input, and demonstrated performance position us to maintain a rapid rate of new product launches. We launched 6 new products in 2021, have a range of new products in various stages of development, and expect to continue to regularly launch new products.
Increase the size, scope and productivity of our exclusive U.S. sales force. We believe there is significant opportunity for us to further penetrate existing markets, and to enter new markets, by increasing the size and geographic scope of our exclusive U.S. sales force for musculoskeletal solutions. We expect to increase the number of our direct and distributor sales representatives in the U.S., to expand into new geographic territories and to deepen our penetration in existing territories. We 

 

will also continue to provide our sales representatives with specialized development programs designed to improve their productivity.
Continue to expand into international markets. As of December 31, 2021, we had an existing direct or distributor sales presence in 49 countries outside the United States. We expect to continue to increase our international presence through the commercialization of additional musculoskeletal solutions products in current markets and through the expansion of our international sales force in current and new markets.
Pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances. In 2017, we acquired KB Medical SA, developer of a computer-assisted robotic guidance system, and in 2018 we acquired Nemaris Inc., a privately held company that markets and develops Surgimap®, a leading surgical planning software platform, to further bolster our efforts to advance surgical procedures through Enabling Technologies. In 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets of StelKast, Inc., a privately held company that designs, manufactures and distributes orthopedic implants for knee and hip replacement surgeries. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company acquired Synoste Oy (“Synoste”), a Finnish engineering company that specializes in the research and development of a limb lengthening system. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company acquired Capstone Surgical Technologies, LLC. (“Capstone”), a privately held company that engages in the business of creating advanced drill and robotic surgery platforms. We intend to selectively pursue acquisitions and alliances that complement our strategic plan and provide innovative technologies, personnel with significant relevant experience, or increased market penetration. We regularly evaluate possible acquisitions and strategic relationships and believe that our resources and experience make us an attractive acquirer or partner.

The Globus Solution 

We believe that our focus on actively listening and responding to the needs of our customers with high quality solutions separates us from our industry peers. Since 2003 we have introduced over 220 products designed for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. Given our robust product portfolio of unique and differentiated products, as well as the numerous disruptive products in various stages of development, we believe we are well positioned for growth in the musculoskeletal markets we operate in. 

We believe that our innovative musculoskeletal solutions products, combined with our ability to provide world-class service through a highly trained and exclusive sales force and corporate account management, create significant value for our customers.

Product Categories

While we group our products into two categories, Musculoskeletal Solutions and Enabling Technologies, they are not limited to a particular technology, platform or surgical approach. Instead, our goal is to offer a comprehensive product suite that can be used to safely and effectively treat patients based on their specific anatomy and condition, and is customized to the surgeon’s training and surgical preference.
Musculoskeletal Solutions

Our Musculoskeletal Solutions consist primarily of implantable devices, biologics, accessories, and unique surgical instruments used in an expansive range of spinal, orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures. Musculoskeletal disorders are a leading driver of healthcare costs worldwide. Disorders range in severity from mild pain and loss of feeling to extreme pain and paralysis. These disorders are primarily caused by degenerative and congenital conditions, deformity, tumors and traumatic injuries. Treatment alternatives for musculoskeletal disorders range from non-operative conservative therapies to surgical interventions depending on the pathology. Conservative therapies include bed rest, medication, casting, bracing, and physical therapy. When conservative therapies are not indicated, or fail to provide adequate quality of life improvements, surgical interventions may be used. Surgical treatments for musculoskeletal disorders can be instrumented, which include the use of implants, or non-instrumented, which forego the use of hardware but may include biologics.

Our broad spectrum of spine products addresses the vast majority of conditions affecting the spine including degenerative conditions, deformity, tumors, and trauma. With almost 20 years in this competitive market, we provide comprehensive solutions that facilitate both open and minimally invasive surgery (“MIS”) techniques. This includes traditional fusion implants such as pedicle screw and rod systems, plating systems, intervertebral spacers and corpectomy devices. We believe we pioneered innovative expandable solutions for interbody fusion, corpectomy and interspinous fixation that allow intraoperative customization of our devices to the patient’s anatomy, eliminating sequential trialing and potentially saving surgical time. We have also developed treatment options for motion preservation technologies, such as dynamic stabilization, total disc replacement and interspinous distraction devices; as well as interventional solutions to treat vertebral compression fractures. Our biologic solutions include regenerative biologic products such as allografts and synthetic alternatives that are adjunctive treatments typically used in combination with stabilizing implant hardware.

Our orthopedic trauma solutions are designed to treat a wide variety of orthopedic fracture patterns and patient anatomies in the upper and lower extremities as well as the hip. Our orthopedic trauma and extremity products, covering four major segments of the 

 

orthopedic trauma market: fracture plates, compression screws, intramedullary nails, and external fixation. We began marketing these products in 2018 and intend to grow our presence in this field. Fracture plating includes proximal humerus, distal radius, proximal tibia, distal tibia, distal fibula, small fragment, mini-fragment and clavicle plates. Intramedullary nailing includes tibial, trochanteric, and femoral nail systems. Regenerative biologic products such as bone void fillers and allograft struts are also used in orthopedic procedures where applicable.

Our hip and knee joint solutions for the treatment of degenerative conditions or failed previous reconstruction have a long history of clinical use. Over 13 different implants have been marketed to date, including modular hip stems and acetabular cups for total hip arthroplasty as well as posterior stabilizing and cruciate retaining knee arthroplasty implants. 

Enabling Technologies

Our Enabling Technologies are comprised of imaging, navigation and robotics (“INR”) solutions for assisted surgery which are advanced computer-assisted intelligent systems designed to enhance a surgeon’s capabilities, and ultimately improve patient care and reduce radiation exposure for all involved, by streamlining surgical procedures to be safer, less invasive, and more accurate. The market for our Enabling Technologies in spine and orthopedic surgery is still in the infancy stage and consists primarily of imaging, navigation and robotic systems. In spine, a majority of these technologies are limited to surgical planning and assistance in implant placement for increased accuracy and time savings with less intraoperative radiation exposure to the patient and surgical staff. As our Enabling Technologies become more fully integrated with our Musculoskeletal Solutions, a continued rise in adoption is expected. Furthermore, we believe as new technologies such as augmented reality and artificial intelligence are introduced, Enabling Technologies have the potential to transform the way surgery is performed and most importantly, continue to improve patient outcomes.

Our INR solutions include the ExcelsiusGPS® platform which is a robotic guidance and navigation system that supports minimally invasive and open procedures with screw and interbody spacer placement applications. The ExcelsiusGPS® platform has a modular design that we expect will serve as a foundation for future clinical applications using artificial intelligence and augmented reality. Also, in 2018, we acquired Nemaris Inc., a privately held company that developed and marketed Surgimap®, a leading surgical planning software platform. Surgimap®’s intuitive, patient-specific surgical planning and cloud-based infrastructure includes predictive algorithms and visual guides that enable healthcare professionals to plan and simulate surgical treatment of complex deformities. The software also enables medical professionals to share medical imaging technology globally to improve procedural workflow and patient care.

Our innovative Enabling Technologies products offer surgeons more information about patient anatomy and surgical options to help them to make well-informed preoperative and intraoperative surgical decisions. We believe the advantages of pre-planning implant position and viewing implants or instruments relative to patient anatomy during surgery are self-evident, and also create significant secondary gains such as eliminating radiation exposure altogether.

Product Development and Research

We believe in bringing products to market quickly by reducing the time from product conception to launch. We believe our approach to product development is unique and highly efficient. We employ an integrated team approach to product development involving collaboration among surgeons, our engineers, our dedicated researchers, our highly-skilled machinists, and our regulatory personnel. We believe that this team approach, as well as our extensive in-house facilities, allows us to design, test and obtain regulatory clearance and approvals for our products more effectively. We also believe that our product development engine provides us with a competitive advantage in developing solutions to challenging clinical problems for surgeons and improving outcome for patients.

Our product development efforts are supported by our in-house research capabilities. We believe that centralizing and consolidating the critical elements of the product development and commercialization process in one facility allows us to bring products from the concept stage to the market more rapidly. Research resources available in-house include a mechanical testing laboratory, spinal kinematics laboratory, tribology laboratory, cadaveric laboratory, materials characterization laboratory, computational laboratory, and clinical and biomechanical research experts.

The markets in which we operate are subject to rapid technological advancements. We must constantly improve existing products and introduce new products in order to continue to succeed. Accordingly, we have made significant investments in our product development and research capabilities.

Sales and Marketing

We market and sell our products primarily through our exclusive global sales force. As of December 31, 2021, we had a direct or distributor sales presence in the United States and in 49 other countries. We have dedicated spinal implant, orthopedic trauma and INR sales teams in place. We sell our hip and knee products primarily through independent sales agents. We expect to continue to increase the number of our direct and distributor sales representatives in each of these areas, both in the U.S. and internationally, to 

 

expand into new geographic territories and to deepen our penetration in existing territories. We believe the expansion of our U.S. and international sales forces provides us with significant opportunities for future growth as we continue to penetrate existing geographic markets and enter new ones.

Our implant sales representatives are present in the operating room during most surgeries in the United States and in many, but not all, of the other countries in which our products are sold. These representatives have the responsibility to confirm that all of the items needed in the surgery are available and are provided sterile or are capable of being sterilized at the hospital. An assortment of sizes and quantities of implants are made available to be able to satisfy varying surgical requirements and patient anatomy, along with numerous surgical instruments and cases needed to safely perform the surgery and implantation. As products are used in surgeries, replacement items are shipped to our sales representatives and hospitals to replenish their supply.

All of our U.S. independent distributors are compensated solely on commission. Most of our new direct sales representatives start with a compensation arrangement that is largely based on salary. Our goal is for members of our direct sales force to move toward a compensation model based solely on commission as they become familiar with our products and drive higher sales.

Competition

We believe that our significant competitors are Medtronic, DePuy Synthes, Stryker, Zimmer Biomet, Smith and Nephew, and NuVasive. Orthofix, Integra LifeSciences, and other smaller public and private companies are also competitors of ours. At any time, these or other market participants may develop alternative treatments, products or procedures for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders that compete directly or indirectly with our products. They may also develop and patent processes or products earlier than we can, or obtain regulatory clearance or approvals for competing products more rapidly than we can.

We compete in the marketplace to recruit and retain qualified scientific, management, and sales personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our business.

Manufacturing and Supply

We have greatly expanded our dedicated in-house manufacturing capabilities. A significant portion of our implant products are manufactured in our facilities in Eagleville, Pennsylvania and Limerick, Pennsylvania. Most of our regenerative biologics products are processed in our facilities in San Antonio, Texas, and in Audubon, Pennsylvania. The ExcelsiusGPS® robotic guidance and navigation system is assembled in our facility in Methuen, Massachusetts.

Of our implant and instrument products that are not manufactured in-house, a majority are generally manufactured through a network of third-party suppliers. Our suppliers use high precision, computer-aided manufacturing equipment to manufacture our products. We have focused on developing a strong supplier base as part of our manufacturing strategy. Our relationship with our suppliers enables significant interaction between our design engineers and project managers and the suppliers’ engineers and schedulers to work through issues arising during the entire product development cycle. The majority of our suppliers are domestic, which affords our engineers and other members of our product development team the opportunity to work closely with them to commercialize our products.

We select our suppliers carefully and generally use a small number of suppliers for each of our key products for added reliability. Our internal quality assurance group evaluates the potential vendor through a formal vendor approval process before we enter into a relationship with the vendor. Suppliers that meet our internal quality assurance standards are added to our approved supplier list. All of our suppliers that provide us with implants are ISO-13485 certified, meaning they meet the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) requirements for the manufacture of medical devices. Our quality assurance group conducts periodic audits to ensure continued compliance with our standards. With every shipment of inventory that we receive, our suppliers provide a certificate of compliance with our quality control standards. Our receiving group also performs inspections, packaging and labeling on site at our headquarters facility.

We work closely with our suppliers to ensure that our inventory needs are met while maintaining high quality and reliability. To date, we have experienced slight delays in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production requirements, but it has not caused a meaningful backlog of sales orders. Despite the current delays, which we believe are temporary and are primarily driven by the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 impact on the global supply chain, we believe our supplier relationships and facilities will support our capacity needs for the foreseeable future. However, it is possible that a prolonged COVID-19 disruption could cause a backlog of sales orders. A majority of our product inventory is held primarily with our sales representatives and at hospitals throughout the United States. We stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title to consigned inventory which is maintained with our field representatives and hospitals in sufficient quantities so that products are available when needed for surgical procedures. Safety stock levels are determined based on a number of factors, including demand, manufacturing lead times, and quantities required to maintain service levels.




Intellectual Property

We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods. In particular, we rely on patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and also utilize nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our rights.

As of December 31, 2021, we owned 1,359 issued U.S. patents (1,332 utility patents; 27 design patents) and had applications pending for 538 U.S. patents (527 utility patents; 11 design patents), and we owned 820 issued foreign patents and had applications pending for 480 foreign patents. Our issued patents expired or will expire between March 2015 and February 2041.

Our trademark portfolio contains 277 registered trademarks and 124 pending trademarks. Our portfolio includes domestic and foreign trademarks with associated logos and tag lines.

Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement

We expect that sales volumes and prices of our Musculoskeletal Solutions products including spinal implant, orthopedic trauma, hip and knee arthroplasty, regenerative biologics, and advanced technology products may grow to be more dependent on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, such as state and federal programs including Medicare, Medicaid and Worker’s Compensation as well as private insurance plans including Blue Cross Blue Shield plans and commercial insurers. Reimbursement is dynamic and is contingent on coding for given services or procedures, coverage by third-party payors, and adequate payment for the services or procedures.

Physicians, hospital outpatient departments, and Ambulatory Surgery Centers (“ASC”) use Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT®”) codes to bill for services and procedures, which are established by the American Medical Association (“AMA”). Specialty societies such as the North American Spine Society, the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, and the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons provide advice to the AMA CPT® Editorial Panel for developing codes. The availability of existing codes to bill for services and procedures may impact the adoption of technology. The CPT codes, depending on the situation and payor rules, are sometimes billed with billing modifiers that can affect coverage and reimbursement.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and the National Center for Health Statistics are jointly responsible for overseeing changes and modifications to International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification/Procedure Coding System (“ICD-10-CM/PCS”) procedure codes used by all providers including physicians and facilities for reporting patient diagnosis(es) (ICD-10-CM codes) and hospitals for reporting inpatient procedures (ICD-10-PCS codes). ICD-10-CM/PCS was implemented in the U.S. on October 1, 2015. This represented the first major coding change for ICD coding in over 30 years. The granularity and specificity of the new ICD-10-CM/PCS coding system may impact reimbursement in the future, particularly hospital inpatient reimbursement. Physician and hospital coding is subject to change, which could impact coverage and reimbursement and thus potentially impact physician practice behavior.

Independent of coding status, third-party payors may deny coverage based on their own criteria. Payor medical policies vary from payor to payor and contract to contract. There are thousands of payor medical policies which are continually reviewed and revised at the discretion of payors. Payor medical policies may become more restrictive. Payors may deem the clinical efficacy of a device or procedure to be experimental or investigational, not the most cost-effective treatment available, or used for an unapproved indication. Additionally, many private payors use coverage decisions and payment amounts established by CMS for the Medicare program as guidelines in setting their coverage and reimbursement policies. Medicare may establish National Coverage Determinations (NCDs) or Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) may establish Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs) that provide coverage information and determine whether services are reasonable and necessary. As the portion of the U.S. population over the age of 65 and eligible for Medicare continues to grow, we may be more vulnerable to coverage and reimbursement limitations imposed by CMS. National and local coverage policy decisions are subject to unforeseeable change and have the potential to impact physician behavior. We will continue to provide the appropriate resources to patients, physicians, hospitals, and insurers in order to promote the best patient care, provide clarity regarding coverage and reimbursement policies, and work to reverse any non-coverage policies.

For federal/state programs, such as Medicaid, coverage and reimbursement differ from state to state. Some state Medicaid programs may not reimburse an adequate amount for the procedures performed with our products, if any payment is made at all. In addition, state-level worker’s compensation coverage and reimbursement vary from state to state. Payment by Medicare and other third-party payors may not be adequate to cover the cost of medical devices used in musculoskeletal procedures. Additionally, more musculoskeletal procedures are being performed in the hospital outpatient and ASC settings, in part due to innovation. Reimbursement levels in the hospital outpatient and ASC settings are typically lower than for the hospital inpatient setting and may not be adequate to cover the cost of innovative and novel medical devices.

In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and some countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines. There can be no assurance that our products will be accepted by third-party 

 

payors, that coverage and reimbursement will be available or, if available, that the third-party payors’ coverage and reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.

We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. There can be no assurance that third-party coverage and reimbursement will be available or adequate, or that future legislation, regulation, coding or coverage and reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to sell these products on a profitable basis.

Government Regulation

Our business is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign regulations. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change.

Both federal and state governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. We believe that we have structured our business operations and relationships with our customers to comply with all applicable legal requirements. However, it is possible that governmental entities or other third parties, including Relators (whistleblowers) who can file complaints on behalf of the government and on their own behalf under the federal civil False Claims Act (“FCA”), could interpret these laws differently and assert otherwise. We discuss below the statutes and regulations that are most relevant to our business.

U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation

Our products are medical devices and human tissue products subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory bodies. FDA regulations govern, among other things, the following activities that we or our partners perform and will continue to perform:

product design and development;
product testing, manufacturing and safety;
post-market surveillance and reporting;
product labeling;
complaint handling;
post-market approval studies; and
product advertising, marketing and promotion.

FDA’s Pre-Market Clearance and Approval Requirements

Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the United States requires either 510(k) clearance, pre-market approval (“PMA”), or grant of a de novo classification request from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose low or moderate risk are placed in either Class I or II. Unless classified as exempt from pre-market notification, Class I and II devices generally require the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification requesting permission for commercial distribution. This process is known as 510(k) clearance. Some low risk devices are exempt from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, and devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) devices are placed in Class III, which typically requires approval of a PMA application. For novel Class III devices that were not previously formally classified by the FDA and that present low to moderate risk, a risk-based classification determination can be requested in accordance with the de novo request process, under which the FDA may determine that the product can be appropriately regulated as a Class I or II device. 510(k) pre-market notifications, de novo requests, and PMAs are subject to the payment of user fees, paid at the time of submission for FDA review. The FDA can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of devices at the time of their clearance or approval, or subsequent to marketing.

Human Cell, Tissue and Cellular and Tissue Based Products

We currently distribute a number of products processed from human tissue, some of which are manufactured by third-party suppliers. The FDA regulates human tissue products as Human Cells and Cellular and Tissue Based Products (“HCT/Ps”). Certain HCT/Ps are regulated solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and are referred to as “Section 361 HCT/Ps,” while other HCT/Ps are subject to the FDA’s regulatory requirements for medical devices or biologics. Section 361 HCT/Ps do not require 510(k) clearance, PMA approval, or other premarket approvals from the FDA before marketing. Tissue banks that handle HCT/Ps must register their establishments with the FDA, list their HCT/P products with the FDA, and comply with FDA donor eligibility and screening requirements, current Good Tissue Practice (“CGTP”), product labeling, and post-market reporting requirements for HCT/Ps.

 



The FDA periodically inspects tissue processors to determine compliance with these requirements. Entities that provide us with allograft bone tissue are responsible for performing donor recovery, donor screening and donor testing and our compliance with those aspects of the CGTP regulations that regulate those functions are dependent upon the actions of these independent entities.

The procurement and transplantation of allograft bone tissue is subject to U.S. federal law pursuant to the National Organ Transplant Act (“NOTA”), a criminal statute which prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs used in human transplantation, including bone and related tissue, for “valuable consideration.” NOTA permits reasonable payments associated with the removal, transportation, processing, preservation, quality control, implantation and storage of human bone tissue. With the exception of removal and implantation, we provide services in all of these areas.

The procurement of human tissue is also subject to state anatomical gift acts and some states have statutes similar to NOTA. In addition, some states require that tissue processors be licensed by that state.

FDA Enforcement

The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:

untitled letters or warning letters;
fines, injunctions and civil penalties;
recall or seizure of our products;
operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
refusing our request for 510(k) or de novo clearance or PMA of new products;
withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMAs that are already granted; 
refusal to grant export approval of our products; and
criminal prosecution.

We are subject to unannounced device inspections by the FDA’s Office of Regulatory Affairs, Office of Compliance, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, as well as other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation and adherence of applicable state and federal tissue licensing regulations. These inspections may include our suppliers’ facilities.

On October 31, 2018, we received a warning letter from the FDA resulting from an inspection of the facilities of our subsidiary Human Biologics of Texas, located in San Antonio, Texas, in April 2018. The letter described observed non-conformities to regulations for human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products relating to one allograft tissue product processed by Human Biologics of Texas and sold to end users by us. We take the matters identified in the warning letter seriously and are working diligently to address the FDA’s observations. We responded to the FDA’s warning letter on November 20, 2018, and subsequently have provided periodic updates regarding our progress towards addressing the FDA’s observations. As of December 31, 2021, this warning letter remains open.

We believe that the FDA’s concerns set forth in the warning letter can be resolved without a material impact to our financial results. We cannot, however, give any assurances that the FDA will be satisfied with our response or as to the expected date of the resolution of the matters included in the warning letter. Until the issues cited in the warning letter are resolved to the FDA’s satisfaction, additional legal or regulatory action may be taken without further notice. Any adverse action by the FDA, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively producing, marketing and selling the product that is the subject matter of the warning letter and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

International

International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. In order to market our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive safety and quality regulations in other countries. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ. The European Union/European Economic Area (“EEA”) requires a CE mark in order to market medical devices. Many other countries, such as Australia, India, New Zealand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, accept CE or FDA clearance or approval. Other countries, such as Brazil, Canada and Japan, require separate regulatory filings.

In the EEA, our devices are required to comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Device Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC). Compliance with these requirements entitles us to affix the CE conformity mark to our medical devices, without which they cannot be commercialized in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE conformity mark we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device 

 

and its classification. Following the expiration of the existing Directive 93/42 CE mark (May 2024), all medical device companies manufacturing and/or marketing products in the EEA, including Globus, will be required to comply with requirements of the Medical Devices Regulation EU 2017/745, which are generally stricter and include increasing technical documentation requirements and altering the classification of some products. Most devices that are CE marked under Directive 93/42 may continue to be marketed in the EU under certain conditions until May 2024, at which point these products must comply with the new regulation. Products placed on the market under the Medical Device Directive may continue to be sold for one year after May 2024.

Additionally, in the EEA the procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells is subject to the requirements of the laws of individual EEA Member States implementing Directive 2004/23/EC, Directive 2006/17/EC and Directive 2006/86/EC.

Further, the advertising and promotion of our products in the EEA is subject to limited provisions under Regulation 2017/745 and the laws of individual EEA Member States implementing Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State laws and industry codes governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws and codes may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals. With the departure of the UK from the EU in January 2021, while CE marking will continue to be accepted by the UK until July 2023, a separate UKCA mark will be thereafter required to market a device in the UK.

We are subject to unannounced device inspections by the Notified Body (an organization accredited by a Member State of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments), as well as other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation and adherence of applicable regulations. These inspections may include our suppliers’ facilities.

Sales and Marketing Commercial Compliance 

Federal anti-kickback laws and regulations prohibit, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for, or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service paid for under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. State anti-kickback laws have similar prohibitions.

In addition, federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and off-label promotion have been pursued by the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) as violations of the civil False Claims Act (“FCA”). Lawsuits under the FCA often are initiated by Relators on behalf of the government. Relators are incentivized to pursue claims against manufacturers and providers by the potential to share in any monetary recoveries by the government in litigation or as part of a settlement, which can be significant. Pursuant to FDA regulations, we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. Although surgeons are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA based on their medical judgment, we are prohibited from promoting products for such off-label uses. A bill pending before the Senate of the United States, the False Claims Amendments Act of 2021 (SB 2428), which was reported favorably out of the Committee on the Judiciary, would broaden the applicability of the FCA and implement other changes that would not be favorable to defendants in FCA cases. If enacted, the False Claims Amendment Act would apply to any case filed under the FCA on or after the date of enactment. Additionally, the majority of states in which we market our products have similar anti-kickback, false claims, anti-fee splitting and physician self-referral laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and violations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. government officials and (in the case of the Bribery Act) private sector decision makers for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government-administered healthcare systems in many jurisdictions around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore potentially subject to such laws. Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased considerably in recent years, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental agencies, and assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals. It is our policy to implement safeguards to educate our employees and agents on these legal requirements and prohibit improper practices. The government may seek to hold us liable for FCPA violations committed by companies that we acquire. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment of current or former employees and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs.

Additionally, we must comply with a variety of other laws that protect the privacy of individually identifiable healthcare information and impose extensive tracking and reporting related to transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, imposes 

 

reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers with respect to ownership and investment interests by physicians and members of their immediate family as well as certain payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians and other healthcare providers licensed in the U.S. and to teaching hospitals. Several states in which we market our products also have imposed healthcare provider payment reporting, gift ban and compliance program requirements on device manufacturers. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply in multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.

Environmental Matters

The manufacture of certain of our products, including our allograft implants and products, and the handling of materials used in the product testing process, including in our cadaveric laboratory, involve the controlled use of biological, hazardous and/or radioactive materials and wastes. Our business and facilities and those of our suppliers are subject to foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of, and exposure to, such materials and wastes. In addition, under some environmental laws and regulations, we could be held responsible for costs relating to any contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites even if such contamination was not caused by us.

We are not currently aware of any material costs or liabilities relating to environmental matters, including any claims or actions under environmental laws or obligations to perform any cleanups at any of our facilities or any third-party waste disposal sites that we expect to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. However, it is possible that material environmental costs or liabilities may arise in the future.

Human Capital

We believe our employees are our most valuable asset and are critical to our success as an organization. Our talent related initiatives, including employee recruitment and development, diversity and inclusion and compensation and benefit programs, are focused on building and retaining the world-class and talented staff that is needed to meet our goals.

As of December 31, 2021, we had over 2,400 employees, including sales and marketing, product development, general administrative and accounting, both domestically and internationally. Our employees are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement except in a single market outside the U.S., and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
