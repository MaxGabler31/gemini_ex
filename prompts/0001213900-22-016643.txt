In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the U.S. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. Since March 11, 2020 states in the U.S., including California, where the Company is headquartered, have begun to open up as the result of the development of vaccines to thwart the spread of the virus. New variants of COVID-19 have surfaced around the world, including the United States which may cause additional closures of economies depending on how virulent the new strains are. New COVID-19 variant outbreaks may further disrupted supply chains and affected production and sales across a wide range of industries. The extent of the impact of new COVID-19 outbreaks on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and further spread of the outbreak, continued impact on our customers, employees and vendors all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.

Core Technologies



The Company’s core technologies can be referred to as “transaction-enabling” and “business process work flow” technologies. These technologies include various forms of electronic signature methods, such as handwritten, biometric, click-to-sign and others, as well as technologies related to signature verification, authentication, cryptography and the logging of audit trails to prove signers’ intent. These technologies enable the appending of secure, legal and regulatory compliant electronic signatures coupled with an enhanced user experience, all at a fraction of the time and cost required by traditional, paper-based processes for signature capture.
Products



The Company’s enterprise-class SignatureOne® and iSign® suite of electronic signature solutions enable businesses to implement truly paperless, electronic signature-driven business processes. The aggregate of the software functionality enabling the digitization of end-to-end work flow processes is sometimes referred to as “digital transaction management” (DTM). Many applications provide electronic forms and allow users to fill-in information, but most of these applications still require users to print out a paper copy for a handwritten, ink signature. Solutions powered by iSign products allow legally binding electronic signatures to be added to digital documents, eliminating the need for paper to memorialize the completion, approval or authentication of the transaction. This allows users to reduce transaction times and processing costs.
