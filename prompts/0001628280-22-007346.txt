Item 1. Business.
We are Owlet
Becoming a parent is a life-changing milestone. New mothers and fathers become caregivers overnight and share the same primary concerns of sleep, safety, health and well-being. Parents, who are increasingly older and busier, assume the roles of doctor, dietitian, and sleep trainer. In many cases, parents receive minimal guidance, counseling, or affirmation of how well they are caring for their newborn, which often leads to increased anxiety and feelings of worry. As a result, parents lose valuable sleep during the first year of an infant’s life, impacting their ability to feel well-rested.
Enter Owlet. Kurt Workman, Jordan Monroe, Zack Bomsta, and Jake Colvin founded Owlet because they wanted access to real-time data to give them peace of mind as new parents. Infant monitoring solutions were highly fragmented and provided limited real-time awareness, leading to a less-than-optimal solution for concerned parents. There was also no product on the market available for parents to track a baby’s sleep patterns, oxygen levels, and heart rate at home. Our founders’ love for their children inspired them to launch Owlet in 2012 and create the Owlet Smart Sock (the "Owlet Smart Sock"), which was first sold in 2015.
Our Company's mission is to empower parents with the right information at the right time, to give them more peace of mind and help them find more joy in the journey of parenting. Our digital parenting platform aims to give parents real-time data and insights to help parents feel calmer and more confident. We believe that every parent deserves peace of mind and the opportunity to feel well-rested. We also believe that every child deserves to live a long, happy, and healthy life, and are working to develop products to help further those beliefs. Our ecosystem of digital parenting solutions is helping to transform modern parenting by providing parents data-driven insights into their children’s well-being in the comfort of their own home. We are also developing in-home pediatric monitoring and analytics technologies, which we believe have the potential to provide parents with additional information about their children and are also designed to notify parents and caregivers of certain biometric findings with the goal of reducing risk of infant death due to Sudden Unexplained Infant Death (SUID) and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and opportunistically detecting infant ailments such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).

Food and Drug Administration Warning Letter
On October 1, 2021, the Company received a Warning Letter, dated the same date (the “Warning Letter”), from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regarding the Smart Sock. The Warning Letter asserts that the Company’s marketing of its Owlet Smart Sock product in the U.S. renders the Owlet Smart Sock a medical device requiring premarket clearance or approval from the FDA, and that the Company has not obtained such clearance or approval in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Warning Letter is focused solely on the regulatory classification of the product in the U.S. as a result of the heart rate and oxygen notifications and related claims. Pursuant to the Warning Letter and in response to the request by the FDA to cease distribution of the Owlet 
Smart Sock in the U.S., the Company suspended distribution of the Owlet Smart Sock in the U.S. in October 2021. The suspension is specific to shipments by the Company to customers and retailers in the U.S. Operations in other countries remain unaffected. In response to the Warning Letter, several national retailers unilaterally suspended U.S. sales of the Owlet Smart Sock and Owlet Monitor Duo. 
In October 2021, the Company announced that it was developing a new sleep monitoring sock (the "Owlet Dream Sock"). The Company began initial distribution of the Owlet Dream Sock in December 2021 through our ecosystem partners and in January 2022 launched the Owlet Dream Sock to consumers in the retail and direct-to-consumer channels. The Owlet Dream Sock is sold as a consumer wellness product, which the Company believes does not present the same concerns that FDA has raised regarding the Owlet Smart Sock, based on differences in the functionality of and marketing claims for the new product. 
The Company plans to submit an application to FDA seeking marketing authorization for the notification features of the Owlet Smart Sock that the FDA believes make the product a medical device. The Company cannot give any assurances that FDA will accept the Company’s application seeking marketing authorization for the notification features as a medical device or that, even if such application is accepted for review, that FDA will grant marketing authorization for those notification features. The Company also cannot give any assurances that FDA will not raise similar concerns regarding the regulatory status of the Owlet Dream Sock. The Company also cannot give any assurances as to the timing of the resolution of such matters. 
As a result of the Warning Letter, the Owlet Care App is no longer available for download in Apple's App Store to users in the U.S. The Owlet Dream App has been released and is available for download for Owlet Dream Sock users and for users who have elected to convert their Owlet Smart Sock into an Owlet Dream Sock via software update.

We are designing these pipeline offerings to complement our existing suite of solutions and create a more connected and comprehensive digital parenting ecosystem.
Monitoring Pipeline
•Sock Versions:
•Smart Sock Plus– The Owlet Smart Sock Plus utilizes the same technology as the Owlet Smart Sock and is designed to grow with children, from newborn to five years. Through an expanded fabric sock set, the Owlet Smart Sock Plus allows families to track oxygen levels, heart rates, and sleep trends for an age range that is three times larger than that of the existing Owlet Smart Sock. The Owlet Smart Sock Plus is not available in the U.S.
•Over-the-Counter “OTC” Smart Sock– The Owlet OTC Smart Sock is under development as a medical device that would, if authorized by the FDA, be sold over-the-counter at retailers without a prescription. Long-term, the Owlet OTC Smart Sock is designed to be able to integrate with various telehealth platforms and preemptively screen for health conditions in babies with no existing medical or health issues. We anticipate that the Owlet OTC Smart Sock will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to commercialization.
•BabySat– Based on the Owlet Smart Sock, the Owlet BabySat is under development as a medical device that would, if authorized by the FDA, be sold for prescription use only. The Owlet BabySat is designed to be able to be utilized by various telehealth platforms and is designed specifically for babies with diagnosed illnesses and health conditions. We have submitted a premarket notification to the FDA seeking 510(k) clearance of the Owlet BabySat. In January 2021, the FDA informed us that additional data would be needed to support 510(k) clearance for the product. We have engaged with the FDA and have obtained feedback on a proposed study design to generate such data to support a resubmission of our application for 510(k) clearance.
•Band– The Owlet Band is under development and anticipated to be designed for pregnant women between 24 to 40 weeks of gestation to offer a deeper connection and reassurance to pregnant women at home. Expectant parents will be able to view collected data in the Owlet pregnancy application as well as hear their baby’s heartbeat. We anticipate that the Owlet Band may require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to commercialization.
Connected Ecosystem Pipeline
We plan to complement our monitoring pipeline with our connected ecosystem pipeline to create a more unified digital parenting experience. We believe our strong brand and platform provide a strong position to develop adjacent products. For example, we plan to develop the Smart Crib, which would connect with our Sock Monitor offerings to understand a baby’s sleep cycles and would utilize automated motion technology to lull babies back to sleep when they wake up. As we develop additional products, we believe parents will increasingly rely on our connected ecosystem for digital parenting solutions.
Platform Pipeline
As we expand our connected ecosystem, we will continue to develop our platform products and services in order to bring additional solutions into the home. Our long-term goal is to integrate with leading telehealth providers who can share infant sleep and health data with medical professionals. We believe obtaining FDA marketing authorization for the notification features identified in the Warning Letter, and similar authorizations and certifications (as applicable) from foreign authorities and notified bodies, and our Owlet OTC Smart Sock, Owlet BabySat, and Owlet Band products will allow us to develop a native Owlet telehealth platform and directly engage medical professionals to provide an end-to-end digital healthcare solution for our customers. To further our commitment to parents and their children from conception to kindergarten, we plan to continue to explore new potential products and services that make parents’ and their children’s lives less stressful and more meaningful.
Our Growth Strategies
We are excited to expand the Company’s footprint, and we plan to implement the following strategies to accelerate our growth:
Leverage Brand Awareness & Grow Distribution to Increase Penetration. We intend to continue our efforts to become one of the most recognizable brand names in the digital parenting category. We believe becoming a recognizable brand helps our offerings stand out in a highly fragmented market of legacy companies lacking a category leader. We see ample room for growth as our existing product suite is in the beginning phase of market penetration. We plan to leverage our paid and organic marketing efforts across social media, display advertising, and email marketing to boost top-of-mind awareness and acquire new users at a sustainable cost. 
Adding New Data-Driven Products to Expand the Digital Parenting Ecosystem. We are building a platform with the goal to be parents’ go-to brand in the areas of sleep, safety, health and well-being, from conception through kindergarten. Our goal is to continue adding products and services at a regular cadence in order to create a digital parenting ecosystem that works together to create a holistic experience for families and leverages the strength of our brand. We believe our robust pipeline of hardware product candidates, including the Owlet Smart Crib, as well as the development of our software and services, will provide us additional opportunities to sell new products to our existing users.
Invest in Clinical Research and Pursue FDA Marketing Authorization to Potentially Open the Door to Coverage and Reimbursement and Telehealth. We plan to grow into the medical and telehealth markets by pursuing FDA marketing authorization of certain products and continuing to invest in clinical research, as exemplified by our recent tachyarrhythmia study published in The Journal of Pediatrics. If we are successful in obtaining marketing authorization from the FDA for the Owlet BabySat, we believe we could build further credibility for our platform with the medical community and help open new medical channels and markets. We are developing the Owlet OTC Smart Sock for healthy babies with no underlying medical conditions. We believe that FDA marketing authorization for either of these products would help open the door to expanded services.
Leverage Brand to Expand into New Markets. While our existing primary market is the U.S., our goal is to continue to use our operating knowledge to successfully and meaningfully expand into new countries. We plan to capitalize on our expansive and growing ecosystem of offerings and acquire additional market share globally, with heightened focus on Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Initially, we expect to utilize online channels and retail channels to facilitate geographic expansion. As our retail penetration increases and brand awareness grows outside of the U.S., we intend to further leverage retail channels and locations to ensure efficient and strategic global customer acquisition.
Growth through Acquisitions. We intend to further deepen our position as a leader in the digital parenting category by opportunistically pursuing acquisitions of companies, platforms, and technologies that would be accretive and complementary to our existing ecosystem and vision. We plan to seek opportunities, particularly healthcare and software-based services, to expand our technological capabilities and product and service offerings to provide incremental value to our users. We believe our digital parenting ecosystem provides a strong foundation to integrate prospective targets and consolidate a fragmented field of products, further bolstering our market reach and growth trajectory.
Our Users
The majority of our users are millennials, a brand-conscious and technological savvy generation, with annual income of $50,000 or more. These parents are more likely to be early technology adopters and have a high affinity towards actionable insight to care for their children. This is evidenced by the one-and-a-half million downloads of the Owlet applications and increasing social media engagement across our multiple platforms.
Research and Development
We are committed to ongoing research and development to create new products and improve the design, operation, and quality of existing products. Our research and development organization includes individuals with expertise in fields including engineering, product design, clinical science, consumer electronics, and embedded software design. Our technical capabilities and commitment to innovation have allowed us to deliver significant product enhancements on a rapid development timeline, which we believe has helped us to support a compelling new product roadmap. From designing innovative and groundbreaking products to employing sophisticated software with proprietary algorithms and backend support, we believe we have built a strong competitive moat and early-mover advantage over potential competition in the connected nursery field. We have a vast infant data set which leads to stronger insights and allows us to develop better products and services, which we believe in turn leads to happier users and drives product purchases.
Our current research and development efforts are focused on developing an expanded ecosystem, with a wider range of products and services for the connected nursery, including telehealth and medical devices that can be utilized by parents from conception to kindergarten.
Competition
Historically, baby monitors and nursery products have been fragmented product categories with multiple players and limited brand loyalty, and have integrated limited amounts of technology and data into the caregiver’s experience. However, we expect the industry in which we operate will continue to evolve and may be significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. Certain potential competitors have substantially greater capital resources, larger product portfolios, larger user bases, larger sales forces and greater geographic presence, and have built relationships with retailers and distributors that may be more effective than ours. Our products and services face additional competition from companies developing products and services for use with third-party monitoring systems, as well as from companies that currently market similar products and services of their own, and may face further pressure from technology companies that have not historically operated in our industry.
Continuing technological advances and new product introductions within the home-use childcare electronics and service industry place our products and services at risk of obsolescence. Our long-term success depends upon the development and successful commercialization of new products and services, new or improved technologies and additional applications for our existing technologies, including products or applications that may be subject to the oversight of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities and could require marketing authorization by the FDA or similar approval, clearance, authorization or certification from comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The research and development process is time-consuming and costly and may not result in products and services or applications that we can successfully commercialize.
We believe that the primary competitive factors in our market are: 
•product quality and performance, including the size, quality, comfort, battery life, reliability, connectivity of the device to the application and/or monitor, and accuracy of algorithm, with regards to both false negatives and false positives; 
•customer purchasing experience;
•pricing;
•product support and service;
•effective marketing and education;
•brand recognition;
•breadth and depth of offerings;
•greater market penetration;
•technological innovation, product enhancements and speed of innovation; and
•sales and distribution capabilities.
We believe our ability to continue to compete effectively in our industry will also depend in part on our ability to respond more quickly and effectively than our peers to new or changing opportunities, technologies, regulatory standards or customer requirements. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as existing companies and competitors develop new or improved products and distribution strategies and as new companies enter the market with new technologies and distribution strategies. Increased competition in the future could adversely affect our revenue, revenue growth rate, margins and market share.
Manufacturing
We rely on several third-party suppliers for single source components used in our devices, including the WiFi chips, microcontrollers, batteries, accelerometers, temperature sensors, plastics and circuit boards.
We follow strict quality guidelines, including a detailed risk-based audit plan following our ISO 9001 quality policy that dictates how often and to what degree we audit our suppliers. We check all quality, regulatory, and safety standards for products that our contract manufacturers make. We deploy a robust manufacturer and supplier selection process including site audits, tooling design and setup quotes, open book pricing, quality specifications, and vendor guides. The Owlet Smart Sock and Owlet Dream Sock are currently manufactured at ISO 13485 certified manufacturing sites. We received ISO 13485 and MDSAP certifications, as we work to implement the requirements 
applicable to medical device manufacturer quality systems. We believe that third-party facilities will be adequate to meet our current and anticipated manufacturing needs. We do not currently plan to manufacture our products or any related components ourselves.
Manufacturing Services Agreement with Benchmark Electronics
In October 2017, we entered into a manufacturing services agreement with Benchmark Electronics, Inc. (“Benchmark”), pursuant to which Benchmark provides us certain manufacturing and related services for the production of our Sock Monitoring offerings out of its facilities in Thailand, including procuring materials and assembling and testing finished products.
The initial term of the agreement expired in October 2018, but the term of the agreement automatically extends for additional one-year periods until either we or Benchmark provide notice of non-renewal at least 90 days prior to the end of the then-current term or extension. Among other things, either party may terminate the agreement for convenience upon 90-day notice, in the case of Owlet, or 180 day notice, in the case of Benchmark, to the other party. Either party may also terminate the agreement under certain other customary conditions, including for uncured breaches of the agreement or if the other party if the other party materials breaches the agreement or in the event of the other party’s insolvency.
In connection with the services provided under the agreement, we have agreed to indemnify Benchmark against certain claims, including infringement of third-party intellectual property rights and noncompliance of our products with safety or other regulations. We are also entitled to customary indemnification rights, subject to certain caps.
Manufacturing Services Agreement with Aoni
In June 2018, we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Shenzhen Aoni Electronic Co., Ltd (“Aoni”), pursuant to which Aoni provides certain manufacturing and related services for the production of our Owlet Cam product, including procuring materials and assembling and packaging finished products.
Following the expiration of the initial term of the agreement in June 2019, we extended the agreement through June 2022. We have the right to terminate the agreement, without cause, upon six months’ prior written notice to Aoni. Additionally, either party may terminate the agreement under certain other customary conditions, including for uncured breaches of the agreement or in the event of the other party’s insolvency.
In connection with the services provided under the agreement, Aoni has agreed to indemnify us against certain claims and liabilities, including claims arising in connection with product defects, breach of the agreement, negligence and violations of applicable law.
Government Regulation
Certain of our products and our operations could be subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other federal and state authorities in the U.S., as well as comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. For example, certain of our products may be subject to regulation as medical devices in the U.S. under the FDCA, as implemented and enforced by the FDA.
U.S. Regulation 
The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the U.S. requires either FDA clearance of a premarket notification submitted under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, or approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General 
Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents.
While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed.
510(k) Clearance Marketing Pathway
To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed predicate device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months, but may take longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees and for medical device establishments. 
If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until such marketing authorization has been granted. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced steps that the FDA intended to take to modernize the 510(k) pathway. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, although the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation.
More recently, in September 2019, the FDA issued revised final guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA has developed and maintains a list device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and continues to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the testing methods recommended in the guidance documents, where feasible. For fiscal year 2022, the standard user fee for a 510(k) premarket notification submission is $0.01 million.
PMA Approval Pathway
Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed, although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. PMA applications are also subject to the payment of user fees, which for fiscal year 2021 includes a standard application fee of $0.4 million.
The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
De Novo Classification
Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II, or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in July 2012, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and de novo classification and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device 
presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. If the device under evaluation does not present a significant risk to human health, then the device sponsor is not required to submit an IDE application to the FDA before initiating human clinical trials, but must still comply with abbreviated IDE requirements when conducting such trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
Regardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device, clinical studies must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may impose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and complying with labeling and record-keeping requirements. In some cases, an IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
Post-market Regulation
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
•QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
•labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or the promotion of “off-label” uses of cleared or approved products;
•requirements related to promotional activities;
•clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of certain modifications to PMA-approved devices;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
•correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
•the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
•post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
Manufacturing processes for medical devices are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled and unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of marketed products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any marketed products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or approval, or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that a manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;
•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;
•withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
•refusal to grant export approvals for our products; or
•criminal prosecution.
Low Risk General Wellness Products
The FDA has established a compliance policy for certain products that may fall within the definition of a medical device, but that are intended for only “general wellness use” and present a low risk to the safety of users and other persons. The FDA defines a “general wellness use” to be (i) an intended use that relates to maintaining or encouraging a general state of health or a healthy activity, or (ii) an intended use that relates the role of healthy lifestyle with helping to reduce the risk or impact of certain chronic diseases or conditions and where it is well understood and accepted that healthy lifestyle choices may play an important role in health outcomes for the disease or condition. For example, the FDA identifies sleep management – such as a product intended to track sleep trends – as an intended use of a product that falls within a general wellness use, provided that the product claims do not make reference to any diseases or conditions. Specifically, the FDA has issued guidance explaining that for such low-risk products, FDA does not intend to examine whether the product constitutes a medical device, and if the product is a medical device, whether the product complies with the premarket review and post-market regulatory requirements of the FDCA. As such, if a medical device falls within the definition of a “low risk general wellness product,” the product may nevertheless be subject to enforcement discretion under the FDA’s compliance policy for such products, meaning that the FDA will not enforce its medical device authorities with respect to that product.
Foreign Government Regulation
In addition to U.S. regulations, we are subject to a variety of foreign government regulations applicable to general consumer products and medical devices.
Regulation of General Consumer Products in the European Union
In the European Union ("EU"), consumer products must comply with the General Product Safety Directive No 2001/95/EC. This Directive covers all products intended for consumers or likely to be used by consumers, placed onto the EU market, unless a specific product safety regulation applies. The General Product Safety Directive provides safety and conformity requirements as well as post-market surveillance obligations for manufacturers and importers. Manufacturers must undertake and document a conformity assessment that covers the risks and risk categories associated with the product. The recommended method of undertaking such an assessment is through the application of voluntary European Harmonized Standards, but other options are available, such as using European Commission guidelines and using product safety codes of good practice. The required conformity assessment consists of a self-assessment with no requirement to involve a third party. Manufacturers also have the obligation to report to the national competent authorities of the different EU member states any risks to the consumer that are incompatible with the general safety requirements. The Directive further imposes other obligations such as collecting information related to use of products after they have been made available to consumers.
Additional regulations may apply to our products and impose further requirements, including the possible application of EU Regulation No 1007/2011 on textile products, which imposes specific labeling and marking requirements. In addition, we may also need to comply with requirements set forth by RoHs Directive No 2011/65/EU, which imposes specific restrictions on the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, and/or the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) Regulation (EU) No 1907/2006, which restricts substances of very high concern and imposes substance registration requirements.
Contrary to EU regulations (which are directly applicable in all EU member states), directives must be implemented by individual member states and may be applied in a way that is not always uniform across the EU. In addition, member states determine the penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to the General Product Safety Directive and other directives and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. Additional national requirements may be applicable to our products, as well.
The advertising and promotion of consumer products is subject to EU directives concerning misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices and specific EU member state legislation governing the advertising and promotion of these products.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (EEA) which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
Regulation of Medical Devices in the European Union
The EU has adopted specific directives and regulations regulating the design, manufacture, clinical investigations, conformity assessment, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Until May 25, 2021, medical devices were regulated by the Council Directive 93/42/EEC (the EU Medical Devices Directive), which has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 (the EU Medical Devices Regulation). Unlike the EU Medical Devices Directive, the EU Medical Devices Regulation is directly applicable in all EU member states without the need for member states to implement into national law. 
In the EU, there is currently no premarket government review of medical devices. However, all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the relevant general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Regulation including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that, during normal conditions of use, it is suitable for its intended purpose. The medical device must be safe and effective and must not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and – where applicable – other persons, provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety, taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the general safety and performance requirements as a practical matter as it creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that general safety and performance requirement.
Compliance with the general safety and performance requirements of the EU Medical Devices Regulation is a prerequisite for European Conformity Marking (CE mark) without which medical devices cannot be marketed or sold in the EU. To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Regulation, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the general safety and performance requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I), where the manufacturer can self-assess the conformity of its products with the general safety and performance requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology or reuse aspects), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system (notified body must presume that quality systems which implement the relevant harmonized standards – which is ISO 13485:2016 for Medical Devices Quality Management Systems – conform to these requirements). If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the general safety and performance requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own 
declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. 
Throughout the term of the certificate of conformity, the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements. In particular, there will be a new audit by the notified body before it will renew the relevant certificate(s).
The EU Medical Devices Regulation requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers (as well as other economic operators such as authorized representatives and importers) must register by submitting identification information to the European Database for Medical Devices ("EUDAMED"), unless they have already registered. The information to be submitted by manufacturers (and authorized representatives) also includes the name, address and contact details of the person or persons responsible for regulatory compliance. The regulation also requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers must assign a unique identifier to the device and provide it along with other core data to the unique device identifier (UDI) database. These new requirements aim at ensuring better identification and traceability of the devices. Each device – and as applicable, each package – will have a UDI composed of two parts: a device identifier (UDI-DI) specific to a device, and a production identifier (UDI-PI) to identify the unit producing the device. Manufacturers are also notably responsible for entering the necessary data on EUDAMED, which includes the UDI database, and for keeping it up to date. The obligations for registration in EUDAMED will become applicable at a later date (as EUDAMED is not yet fully functional). Until EUDAMED is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply for the purpose of meeting the obligations laid down in the provisions regarding exchange of information, including, and in particular, information regarding registration of devices and economic operators. 
All manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EU must comply with the EU medical device vigilance system which has been reinforced by the EU Medical Devices Regulation. Under this system, serious incidents and Field Safety Corrective Actions (FSCAs) must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU member states. These reports will have to be submitted through EUDAMED – once functional – and aim to ensure that, in addition to reporting to the relevant authorities of the EU member states, other actors such as the economic operators in the supply chain will also be informed. Until EUDAMED is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply. A serious incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or performance of a device made available on the market, including use-error due to ergonomic features, as well as any inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer and any undesirable side-effect, which, directly or indirectly, might have led or might lead to the death of a patient or user or of other persons or to a temporary or permanent serious deterioration of a patient’s, user’s or other person’s state of health or a serious public health threat. Manufacturers are required to take FSCAs defined as any corrective action for technical or medical reasons to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident associated with the use of a medical device that is made available on the market. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices. For similar serious incidents that occur with the same device or device type and for which the root cause has been identified or a FSCA implemented or where the incidents are common and well documented, manufacturers may provide periodic summary reports instead of individual serious incident reports. 
The advertising and promotion of medical devices is subject to some general principles set forth in EU legislation. According to the EU Medical Devices Regulation, only devices that are CE marked may be marketed and advertised in the EU in accordance with their intended purpose. Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, while not specific to the advertising of medical devices, also apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules, for example, requiring that advertisements are evidenced, balanced and not misleading. Specific requirements are defined at a national level. EU member states’ laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices, which vary between jurisdictions, may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals. 
Many EU member states have adopted specific anti-gift statutes that further limit commercial practices for medical devices, in particular vis-à-vis healthcare professionals and organizations. Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities and many EU member states have adopted national “Sunshine Acts” which impose reporting and transparency requirements (often on an annual basis), similar to the requirements in the U.S., on medical device manufacturers. Certain countries also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs. The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA. 
Brexit and Regulation of Medical Devices in the United Kingdom
Since January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has become the sovereign regulatory authority responsible for Great Britain (i.e. England, Wales and Scotland) medical device market according to the requirements provided in the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended) that sought to give effect to the three pre-existing EU directives governing active implantable medical devices, general medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices whereas Northern Ireland continues to be governed by EU rules according to the Northern Ireland Protocol. Following the end of the Brexit transitional period on January 1, 2021, new regulations require medical devices to be registered with the MHRA (but manufacturers were given a grace period of four to 12 months to comply with the new registration process) before being placed on Great Britain market. The MHRA only registers devices where the manufacturer or their United Kingdom (UK) Responsible Person has a registered place of business in the UK. Manufacturers based outside the UK need to appoint a UK Responsible Person that has a registered place of business in the UK to register devices with the MHRA in line with the grace periods. Additionally, UK-based notified bodies, which were designated to independently assess the conformity of certain products requiring CE marking before being placed on the EU market, are now no longer established in the EU, and accordingly, the conformity assessments carried out by such UK bodies, including those assessments carried out prior to January 1, 2021, are no longer valid for the EU compliance regime. Manufacturers whose products currently rely on third-party conformity assessments carried out by UK notified bodies now require new conformity assessments to be carried out by EU-based notified bodies in order to ensure continuing compliance with the EU regime and to continue to place those products on the EU market. By July 1, 2023, in Great Britain, all medical devices will require a UKCA (UK Conformity Assessed) mark but CE marks issued by EU notified bodies will remain valid until this time. Manufacturers may choose to use the UKCA mark on a voluntary basis until June 30, 2023. However, UKCA marking will not be recognized in the EU. The rules for placing medical devices on the market in Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK, differ from those in the rest of the UK. Compliance with this legislation is a prerequisite to be able to affix the UKCA mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in Great Britain.
An MHRA public consultation was opened until the end of November 2021 on the post-Brexit regulatory framework for medical devices and diagnostics. MHRA seeks to amend the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (which are based on EU legislation, primarily the EU Medical Devices Directive, the EU Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive and the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive), in particular to create a new access pathways to support innovation, create an innovative framework for regulating software and artificial intelligence as medical devices, reform in vitro diagnostic medical devices regulation, and foster sustainability through the reuse and remanufacture of medical devices. The regime is expected to come into force in July 2023, coinciding with the end of the acceptance period for EU CE marks in Great Britain, subject to appropriate transitional arrangements. The consultation indicated that the MHRA will publish guidance in relation to the changes to the regulatory framework and may rely more heavily on guidance to add flexibility to the regime.
In addition, the trade deal between the UK and the EU generally provides for cooperation and exchange of information between the parties in the areas of product safety and compliance, including market surveillance, enforcement activities and measures, standardization-related activities, exchanges of officials, and coordinated product recalls. As such, processes for compliance and reporting should reflect requirements from regulatory authorities.
Under the terms of the Northern Ireland Protocol, Northern Ireland follows EU rules on medical devices and devices marketed in Northern Ireland require assessment according to the EU regulatory regime. Such assessment may be conducted by an EU notified body, in which case a CE mark is required before placing the device on the market in the EU or Northern Ireland. Alternatively, if a UK notified body conducts such assessment, a ‘UKNI’ mark applied and the device may only be placed on the market in Northern Ireland and not the EU. 
Other Foreign Regulations
Similarly, we are subject to regulations and product registration requirements in many foreign countries in which we may sell our products, including in the areas of:
•design, development, manufacturing, and testing;
•product standards;
•product safety;
•product safety reporting;
•marketing, sales, and distribution;
•packaging and storage requirements;
•labeling requirements;
•content and language of instructions for use;
•record keeping procedures;
•advertising and promotion;
•recalls and field corrective actions;
•import and export restrictions; and
•tariff regulations, duties, and tax requirements;
We may also become subject to the following additional requirements in many foreign countries in which we may sell future medical devices, including in the areas of:
•clinical testing;
•post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;
•registration for reimbursement; and
•necessity of testing performed in country by distributors for licensees.
Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations 
Other Healthcare Laws
Medical device manufacturers are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business and may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as, sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval or certification. Such laws include, without limitation, federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, and physician and other healthcare provider payment transparency laws and regulations. If their operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal, state, and foreign healthcare programs and imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
With respect to our current products, including the Owlet Smart Sock, Owlet Dream Sock, Owlet Cam and Owlet Dream Lab, we utilize a direct-to-consumer model where consumers purchase our products directly from us or one of our retailers. Currently, these products are not covered or reimbursed by any third-party payor. We are actively developing a strategy to enable healthcare providers to obtain reimbursement for products for which we successfully obtain FDA authorization or similar authorization or certification in foreign jurisdictions, including the Owlet BabySat, or the services associated with such products. However, this new strategy may not be successful as payors may refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement for these products even if we obtain FDA authorization or similar authorization or certification in foreign jurisdictions.
Sales of any product that we may develop and for which we may obtain marketing authorization or certification from the FDA and/or comparable foreign regulatory authorities or notified bodies depend, in part, on the extent to which such product or services associated with such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product or services associated with such product by third-party payors. Even though a new product may have been cleared or otherwise authorized , or certified for commercial distribution by the FDA, foreign regulatory authorities or notified bodies, we may find limited demand for the product unless and until reimbursement approval has been obtained from governmental and private third-party payors.
Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical devices and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover the product or the services associated with the product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales.
Healthcare Reform
The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products that obtain marketing authorization or certification from the FDA and/or comparable foreign regulatory authorities or notified bodies profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the services associated with the use of our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our products.
In the U.S., the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, for example, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially, and affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The ACA included, among other things, incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the ACA expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
Since its enactment, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order initiating a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare. It is unclear how healthcare reform measures enacted by Congress or implemented by the Biden administration, if any, will impact our business.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to providers by 2% per fiscal year, effective on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, and a 1% reduction from April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments, which began in 2019, that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models, such as accountable care organizations.
We expect additional state, federal or foreign healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal, state or foreign governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products for which we obtain marketing authorization or certification or additional pricing pressure.
Data Privacy and Security
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, including HIPAA, and consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the CCPA and the GDPR, govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Telemedicine
We intend to develop and market telehealth/telemedicine services internationally and may be subject to additional regulations and requirements governing such services. The provision of telemedicine services, which are considered healthcare services, is not regulated or harmonized at EU/EEA level and we would therefore need to comply with individual regulations in each EEA country as well as other foreign jurisdictions.
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Laws
We may also be subject to similar anti-corruption legislation implemented in Europe through EU Member State laws and under the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.
Intellectual Property
Since inception, we have been methodical around our intellectual property strategy. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of December 31, 2021, we had 52 issued patents (with numerous others pending) and 40 registered trademarks. Our patents include utility patents covering technology ranging from placement of electrodes to the base of the baby monitor. We have foreign patents and patent applications pending in the EU, Australia, Canada, and China. Our issued patents with claims generally directed to an infant sock comprised of a sensing device in a sleeve in the sock and a strap are expected to expire in the U.S. in 2032 and in China in 2035. Our issued patents with claims generally directed to placement of fabric electrodes and assembly of such are each expected to expire in the U.S., the EU, Australia, China and Canada in 2038. Pending applications in the aforementioned countries will have expiration dates between 2034 and 2040. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.
Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and we cannot assure you that any current or subsequently issued patents will protect our intellectual property rights. Third parties may challenge certain patents issued to us as invalid, may independently develop similar or competing technologies or may design around any of our patents. We cannot be certain that any of the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights in these countries as fully as in the U.S.
Ayla Subscription Agreement
In May 2014, we entered into a subscription agreement with Ayla Networks, Inc. (“Ayla”), pursuant to which Ayla has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty free license to certain cloud services and product software used in our Owlet Smart Sock product and to support the transfer of data to the cloud and back to Owlet and the customer.
The initial term of the agreement expired in December 2015, but we have extended the term of the agreement until January 1, 2024. We may terminate the agreement at any time. Additionally, either party may terminate the agreement upon 30 days’ notice if the other party materially breaches the agreement.
Under the agreement, we have agreed to indemnify Ayla against certain claims arising in connection with or breach of the agreement or our use, or misuse, of the services provided by Ayla under the agreement. We are also entitled to indemnification from Ayla under certain scenarios arising from third-party claims of intellectual property infringement by Ayla.
In connection with the subscription agreement, we also entered into a data processing agreement with Ayla, pursuant to which Ayla has agreed to implement appropriate data security measures and treat all personal data as strictly confidential.
We currently utilize Ayla to support both our Smart Sock and Dream Sock product offerings.
Service and License Agreement with ThroughTek
In January 2018, we entered into a service and license agreement with ThroughTek Co., Ltd. (“TUTK”), pursuant to which TUTK has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty free license to its “Kalay” platform. TUTK provides the data transfer services from the Owlet Cam to the Owlet application so users can view the video feed.
Under the agreement, we paid an initial license fee of $25,000 plus a low-single digit dollar amount per device license fee to access TUTK’s services (“UID”). The UID cost per unit is subject to change at any time by our mutual 
agreement, but shall not increase by more than a low single-digit percentage per year. We also pay certain negotiated services fees to TUTK, which are also subject to a low single digit percentage increase.
The initial term of the agreement expired in January 2021, but automatically renewed for an additional one-year period. The agreement will continue to automatically renew for one-year periods, unless terminated by us or TUTK at least 90 days prior to the end of the then-current renewal period. Among other things, either party may terminate the agreement under certain customary conditions, including for non-payment, uncured breaches of the agreement or in the event of the other party’s insolvency.
In connection with the services provided under the agreement, we and TUTK have agreed to mutually indemnify the other party against certain claims resulting from infringement of third-party intellectual property.
Environmental Matters
Our operations, properties and products are subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and waste and remediation of releases of hazardous materials. We believe, based on current information that we are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations applicable to us. However, our failure to comply with present and future requirements under these laws and regulations, or environmental contamination or releases of hazardous materials on our leased premises, as well as through disposal of our products, could cause us to incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs, personal injury and property damage claims, fines and penalties, costs to redesign our products or upgrade our facilities and legal costs, or require us to curtail our operations, any of which could seriously harm our business.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had 200 full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.
We believe our innovation and operational excellence stems directly from the diversity in our community and our common commitment to equity, inclusion, and equal access to healthcare. As of December 31, 2021, over 48% of our employees were women and over 27% were from minority groups.
