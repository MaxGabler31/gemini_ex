ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a technology development and licensing company. We have developed technology that converts waste plastic into ultra-clean, ultra-low sulphur fuel products through our proprietary plastic-to-oil, or P2O, process. Previously, our business model was the sale of fuel produced from our own P2O processors and subsequently we sought to manufacture P2O processors for sale to commercial customers. These prior experiences allowed the Company to hone and solidify its technology, however, the capital requirements were significant. For this and other reasons, management shifted its business strategy to technology development and licensing model. We no longer produce and market fuel for sale and no longer manufacture processors ourselves, instead we rely on third party manufacturers. Under our current business model, we seek to license our technology to companies that generate significant waste plastics and desire to have a P2O processor on site to convert the plastics to useable fuel for their operations. We charge our customers for the P2O processor and related equipment, a royalty fee based on the amount of fuel generated, a licensing fee for the use of our proprietary catalyst, and a set up and service fee.
 
As of May 2019, we had three fully-permitted, P2O processors at our Niagara Falls, NY facility and have the capability to produce and store the fuels at, and ship from, such facility. However, it is our strategy to license our P2O technology and know-how to licensees for their use in producing fuel for their own operations directly from the waste plastics that such licensees generate from their own operations.
 
Of our three P2O processors, one is dedicated to research and development and two dedicated to fuel production during pilot runs for customer demonstration. We have components for two additional processors, Nos. 4 and 5, which are in process of assembly for future sale. For the reasons described in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, our three P2O processors have been idle since late December 2013 and assembly of processors #4 and #5 was suspended. In light of the change in our business model, management has determined that it only requires an operational processor to demonstrate the Company’s technology. Thus, our processors are likely to remain idle or incomplete, as applicable. We currently are offering one of our processors for sale, along with certain real estate in an effort to raise operating capital
 
We conduct our P2O business at our facilities located in Niagara Falls, New York. Our corporate address is 20 Iroquois Street, Niagara Falls, NY 14303.
 
Organizational History
 
We were incorporated on April 20, 2006 under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name 310 Holdings Inc. (“310”). On April 24, 2009, the Company’s founder, former CEO and Chief of Technology, John Bordynuik, purchased 63% of the issued and outstanding shares of 310 and became the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. On June 25, 2009, we purchased certain assets from John Bordynuik, Inc., a corporation founded by Mr. Bordynuik. The assets acquired included tape drives, computer hardware, servers and a mobile data recovery container to read and transfer data from magnetic tapes. From inception until August 2009, we were a shell company within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. On August 24, 2009, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Javaco, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Domark International, Inc. On September 30, 2009, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Pak-It, LLC. We formed JBI (Canada) Inc. on February 9, 2010 for purposes of distributing Pak-It products in Canada. We formed Plastic2Oil of NY, #1, LLC on May 4, 2010, for the development and commercialization of our Plastic2Oil business in Niagara Falls, NY.
 
On October 5, 2009, we changed our corporate name to JBI, Inc.
 
On August 24, 2009, the Company acquired Javaco, Inc. (“Javaco”), a distributor of electronic components, including home theater and audio video products. On July 9, 2012, we announced the closure of our Javaco operations and sold substantially all of its assets to an unrelated third party. In July 2012, the Company closed Javaco and sold substantially all its inventory and fixed assets.

P2O Overview

We are a technology development and licensing company. We have developed technology that converts waste plastic into ultra-clean, ultra-low sulphur fuel products through our proprietary plastic-to-oil, or P2O, process. We have constructed several fully operational P2O processors to demonstrate our technology and process to potential customers. Previously, our business model was the sale of fuel produced from our own P2O processors and subsequently we sought to manufacture P2O processors for sale to commercial customers. These prior experiences allowed the Company to hone and solidify its technology, however, the attendant capital requirements management were significant. For this and other reasons, management shifted its business strategy to technology development and licensing model. We no longer produce and market fuel for sale and no longer manufacture processors ourselves, instead we rely on third party manufactures. Under our current business model, we seek to license our technology to companies that generate significant waste plastics and desire to have a P2O processor on site to convert the plastics to useable fuel for their operations. We charge the company for the P2O equipment, a royalty fee based on the amount of fuel generated, a license fee for the use of our proprietary catalyst, and a set up and service fee.

We provide environmentally-friendly solutions through our processors and technologies. Our primary offering is our Plastic2Oil®, or P2O®, solution, which is our proprietary process that converts waste plastic into fuel through a series of chemical reactions (our “P2O business”).
 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, neither manufacturing nor sales activity took place. We plan to grow mainly from sale of P2O equipment, a royalty fee based on the amount of fuel generated, a license fee for the use of our proprietary catalyst, and a set up and service fee. We continue seeking opportunities to execute on our business strategy with the goal of becoming a leading North American company whose technology transforms waste plastic into ultra-clean, ultra-low sulphur fuel. We have years of operating data and have solved numerous challenges that vexed the plastics-to-oil industry. Since inception we have produced approximately 670,000 gallons of fuel. Our P2O processors have evolved into a modular solution with the completion of our third P2O processor in 2013. We use third party contract manufacturers to supply us with many of the key modular components of our processors, including the kilns, distillation towers and other key components that require specialized machining and fabrication.
 
Our proprietary P2O process converts waste plastic into fuel through a series of chemical reactions. We developed this process in 2009 and began very limited commercial production in 2010 following our receipt of a consent order from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (“NYSDEC”) allowing us to commercially operate our first large-scale P2O processor at our Niagara Falls, New York facility. Currently, we have three fully-permitted P2O processors, which are capable of producing Naphtha, Fuel Oil No. 2 and Fuel Oil No. 6, all of which are fuels produced to the specifications published by ASTM. One fully-permitted P2O processor is dedicated to research and development activities. We have components for two additional processors at an outside vendor, which were impaired in the 4th quarter of 2016. Our P2O process is capable of producing two by-products, an off-gas similar to natural gas and a petcoke carbon residue. 
 
We shut down our fuel production late in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to severe cold weather that caused damage to condensers and other components of our processors and we have not resumed fuel production due to the repair costs as well as our shift in strategy toward manufacturing processors for sale, as opposed to producing and selling fuel products. Management estimates that the repair of the processors will require the expenditure of between $275,000 and $300,000. An additional $500,000 of startup working capital will be required to resume operations mainly for hiring operational personnel and incremental overhead expenses. We lacked the working capital or access to bank credit to make these repairs. We are reviewing our financing options, including the sale of shares of our common stock or other securities, and or the sale of property and or equipment in order to allow us to obtain sufficient funds to possibly recapitalize the company.
 
Currently, we understand that there are several plastic-to-oil processes operational globally. These other processes employ a wide range of technologies and yield varying purities of fuel output. We believe that our process has many advantages over many other commercially available processes in that our P2O solution requires a comparatively less initial capital investment and yields high-quality, ultra-low sulphur fuel, with no need for further refinement. Additionally, our process uses comparatively little energy and physical space, which, in our view, makes it well suited for high-volume production and expansion to multiple sites.
 
P2O Process and Operations
 
Our patent-pending P2O conversion process involves the cracking of the plastic hydrocarbon chains at ambient pressure using a catalyst. There are various processes in existence for converting plastic and other hydrocarbon materials into products for use in the production of fuels, chemicals and recycled items. These processes include: pyrolysis (conversion using dry materials at high pressure and temperature in the absence of oxygen), catalytic conversion (conversion using a catalyst for stimulating a chemical reaction), depolymerization (conversion using superheated water and high pressure and temperature) and gasification (conversion at high temperature using oxygen or steam).

We have developed our P2O processors with the ability to be continuously running, energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly while converting waste plastics into end-user ready, and ultra-clean, ultra-low sulfur fuels. The processors are periodically shut-down for maintenance and residue removal during operations. The fuels produced can be used directly by our customers without further refining or processing. Over a three year development period from 2009-2012, we scaled our processing operations from a one gallon processor to three processors, each permitted to feed up to 4,000 pounds of feedstock per hour. In prior years, some of the milestones that we have reached include:
 

● | Manufacturing and operating multiple processors at our Niagara Falls, NY site; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | From inception, the processors were designed with safety and green emissions as top priorities; 
● | Standardization and modularization of the components of our processors; 
● | Ability to continuously feed waste plastic 24 hours a day; 
● | Approximately 86% of waste plastic by weight is converted to liquid fuel conversion; 
● | Approximately 8% of waste plastic by weight is converted to gas and is used to fuel the process; 
● | Operating at atmospheric pressure, not susceptible to pinhole leaks and other problems with pressure and vacuum-based systems; 
● | No requirement for incinerators, thermal oxidizers or scrubbers and no stack monitoring is necessary; 
● | Three stack tests (two on the initial processor and one on the second processor) conducted by Conestoga-Rovers & Associates (“CRA”), prove emissions are extremely low; 
● | Process validation by SAIC Energy, Environment & Infrastructure, LLC and IsleChem, LLC; and 
● | Permitted to operate three processors commercially in New York by the NYSDEC. 

Processor Input
 
Waste Plastics: We are able to feed mainly mixed unwashed waste plastics into the Plastic2Oil processors. Waste plastic is widely available, and we are focused on maximizing the types and densities of the plastic we procure for optimal processor performance.
 
Heat Transfer Fluid: We are also able to include hydrocarbon base fluid as feed into the P2O processors.
 
Processor Output
 
We are currently permitted to feed two tons, or 4,000 pounds, of waste plastic per hour into each processor by a continuous conveyor belt where it is heated by a burner that mainly burns off-gases produced from the P2O process. Plastic hydrocarbons are cracked into various shorter hydrocarbon chains and exit in a gaseous state. Any residue, metals, and or non-usable substances remain in the reactor and are periodically removed. Through our proprietary process, Fuel Oil No. 6, Fuel Oil No. 2, and Naphtha are condensed from the reactor through the remainder of the process. The fuel output is then transferred to storage tanks automatically by the system. Our process is mainly operated by an automated computer system that controls the conveyor feed rate, system temperatures, off-gas systems, and the pumping out of newly created fuel to storage tanks. The plastic to liquid fuel conversion is approximately 86% by weight. Therefore, twenty tons of plastic can be processed into approximately 4,100 gallons of fuel. We have three processors at our Niagara Falls, NY facility. One processor was dedicated to research and development and all three processors remained idle due to maintenance and repair issues.
 
Fuel Produced: The fuel produced in our processors is ultra-low sulfur fuel and is ready for end-users without the need for further refinement.

Off-gas: Approximately 8-10% of waste plastics fed into the processors are converted to a mixture of hydrogen, methane, ethane, butane and propane gas, which we call “off-gas”. Once our processors are in a state to begin the P2O process, they use their own off-gas to fuel the burners in the process.
 
Residue: There is approximately 2-4% residue from our process, which is petroleum coke or carbon black (which we call “petcoke”) that needs to be removed on a periodic basis to a waste facility.
 
Feedstock
 
Our P2O process primarily uses post-commercial and industrial waste plastic that might otherwise be sent to a landfill by the commercial and industrial producers of such waste plastic. We believe that this can be costly for these producers due to the large volumes of plastic waste that they generate. As such, our business model is premised on the processor’s ability to accept numerous types of waste plastics from such sources at a relatively low cost. We believe that our processor ability to accept mainly mixed, unwashed waste plastics is a significant advantage of our P2O process compared to similar operations in our industry.
Fuel Products
 
Our P2O process makes both light and heavy fuel products which are Naphtha, Fuel Oil No. 2 and Fuel Oil No. 6, as defined by ASTM. Our process also generates two main by-products, a reusable off-gas similar to natural gas and a carbon residue known as petcoke.
 
Naphtha is a very light fuel product that is used as a cutting component for both high and regular grade gasoline. Fuel Oil No. 2 is a mid-range fuel commonly known as diesel and has numerous transportation, manufacturing, and industrial uses. Fuel Oil No. 6 is a heavy fuel generally used in industrial boilers and ships. Our process produces high quality, ultra-low sulphur fuels, without the need for further refinement which enables fuel sales directly from the processors to the end-user.
 
The reusable off-gas that is produced by the P2O process is used to fuel the burner that heats the entire processor.
 
P2O Facilities
 
We currently own one main facility (located in Niagara Falls, NY) that we use in our P2O business, as well as a second owned facility, our fuel blending site (located in Thorold, Canada), for use in the future. These are briefly described below. Additional information on our properties can be found in Item 2 of this report.
 
Niagara Falls, NY facility: Our Niagara Falls, NY facility currently is comprised of two buildings that are owned by the Company, a 10,000 square foot building that currently houses one commercial-scale P2O processor and one P2O processor devoted to research and development activities, and a 7,200 square foot building housing the third commercial-scale P2O processor. Our Niagara Falls operations are situated on eight acres that can accommodate expansion of our operations. This facility also serves as the center of our research and development operations and our administrative offices.
 
Blending Site: We own a 250,000 gallon fuel-blending facility in Thorold, Ontario, Canada, which, when in use, would allow us to blend and self-certify certain fuels that are produced from our process to meet government specifications.
 
All properties are pledged under various agreements as described in Item 7, Transactions with Related Parties.
 
Sales and Distribution
 
Our P2O business is a commercial manufacturing and production business. We plan to grow mainly from the licensing of technology and the sale of processors.

Suppliers
 
We rely on third party manufacturers for the manufacture of many components of our processors, including kilns and distillation towers.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, two suppliers, accounted for 34.3% of accounts payable. The two consist of Colgate Industries and 2335524 Ontario, Inc., for which terms are all past due.
Licenses, Permits and Testing
 
We maintain the following permits and licenses in connection with the operation of our P2O business.
 

License/Permit | Issuing Authority | Registration Number | Issue date

Industry Background
 
Alternative fuels are generally considered to be any substances that can be used as fuel, other than conventional fossil fuels such as naturally occurring oil, gas and coal. There have been many approaches taken to producing alternative fuels, including conversion of corn oil, vegetable oil and non-food-based materials. These approaches have demonstrated varying degrees of commercial potential. Some of the challenges that alternative fuel producers have faced include high feedstock supply costs, lower perceived value of fuel product, higher capital costs and dependence on government regulations for economic viabilities. We believe our company is distinguishable from other producers of alternative or renewable fuels because our P2O solution represents a process and product that is commercially viable and designed to provide immediate benefit for industries, communities and government organizations with waste plastic recycling challenges. Our business model is premised on the need for a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to disposing of waste plastic in jurisdictions where the cost of transporting and landfilling large amounts of plastic is quite costly.
Competition
 
Our P2O business has elements of both a recycling business and a fuel refiner/production business, which makes it difficult to identify and make direct comparisons to competitors. Both the recycling and energy sectors are characterized by rapid technological change. Our future success will depend on our ability to achieve and maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances in both of these sectors. We believe that our business currently faces competition in the plastics-to-energy market, including competition from PK Clean, Green Envirotec Holdings LLC, Vadaxx and RES polyflow, each of which has developed alternative methods for obtaining and generating fuel from plastics. Because P2O solution end products include a variety of fuels, we also face competition from the broader petroleum industry.
Business Model
 
We believe that our business model provides a unique proposition for both the “supply side” and the “end-user” side of the waste-to-fuel value chain. Our P2O technology is positioned to link these two sides by offering economic incentives in both directions. We believe P2O offers value to suppliers of waste plastic by saving transport and landfill tipping fees, and value to fuel end-users by providing ultra-low sulphur green fuel. Given these incentives, we believe that our business will be sought after by those industries that can benefit from the added value that we provide, thus allowing the potential for our company’s growth through sale and license of our technology and equipment.

Business Strategy
 
Under our current business model, we seek to license our technology to companies that generate significant waste plastics and desire to have a P2O processor on site to convert the plastics to useable fuel for their operations. Our target customers for our processors are private companies and municipalities in the recycling industry who can operate on a commercial scale. We charge the company for the P2O equipment, a royalty fee based on the amount of fuel generated, a license fee for the use of our proprietary catalyst, and a set up and service fee. In light of the change in our business model, management has determined that it only requires an operational processor to demonstrate the Company’s technology. Thus, our processors are likely to remain idle or incomplete, as applicable. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are as follows:
Marketing Strategy
 
We target post-commercial and industrial waste plastic partners. We believe this allows us to identify sources of large plastic waste streams, such as industrial sites and material recovery facilities and recycling centers. We also seek to partner with businesses and municipalities that collect waste plastics. Our vision is to help redirect these waste plastic streams, preventing them from entering landfills.
Manufacturing and Procurement Strategy
 
Our P2O business model allows us to simultaneously pursue sales to multiple commercial opportunities (partners) across the waste plastic and fuel markets. Our P2O processors have evolved to be modular solutions with the completion of processor #3 in 2013. We use third party contract manufacturers for the manufacture of many of the key modular components of our processors, including the kilns, distillation towers as well as other key components that require specialized machining and fabrication. We will license our P2O technology, including construction operation and maintenance of processors for operation at our partners’ sites. Our strategy is to have our partners construct clusters of P2O processors at sources of large plastic waste streams, such as industrial sites, material recovery facilities and recycling centers.
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that our competitive strengths are as follows:
 
Our processors convert unwashed waste plastics into “in specification fuels” ready for use by the end-user customer. Our process does not generate any waste water. The fuel is Halide-free and there is no further need for refinement. The process does not produce any hazardous waste.
 
In addition to producing fuel, our P2O solution simultaneously addresses the problem of disposing of waste plastic. We offer an alternative to disposing of waste plastic in a landfill. Our processors can accept mainly mixed, unwashed plastic feedstock. In the United States and Canada, a substantial amount of plastic is currently considered waste and is disposed of in landfills, resulting in tipping fees levied by the landfill or other waste disposal facility fees. We believe that the current low landfill diversion rates for waste plastic in the United States and Canada, together with the costs of transporting and disposing of plastic in bulk, present a significant opportunity to provide an alternative to conventional recycling and waste disposal.
 
The P2O process provides a highly efficient means of converting plastic into fuel. Our proprietary P2O process and catalyst provide a highly efficient means of converting plastic into fuel. Our business model depends on us being able to provide both a cost-competitive means of disposing of waste plastic and an efficient and non-energy intensive means of producing fuel. Our process requires comparatively minimal electricity to operate, and the energy balance of the process is positive, meaning that more energy can be produced than is consumed by the process.
 
Low capital costs and small footprint. We have designed the processors with a modular design with standardized components, making construction of our processors relatively simple and cost effective. We have designed our processors to take up approximately 3,000 square feet of space, giving the processors a relatively small footprint. We believe that this design facilitates the construction and operation of multiple processors on a single site. We estimate that the costs of constructing our processors on industrial partner sites will be substantially less than the cost of constructing waste-to-fuel facilities offered by our competitors.

Lower emissions
 
In the United States, businesses and other producers of emissions are subject to various regulatory requirements, including the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, or “NESHAP.” These emission standards may be established according to Maximum Achievable Control Technology requirements set by the EPA, often referred to as “MACT standards”. MACT standards apply to a number of sources of emissions, including operators of boilers, process heaters and certain solid waste incinerators. Because our P2O fuel products have ultra-low sulphur content, we believe that our P2O fuel can assist industrial partners with meeting MACT requirements through reduced hazardous emissions.
 
Our processors produce fuels that have very low sulphur content, which allows the end-user to potentially lower the emissions generated by its operations while using our fuels. These lower emissions potentially could save the end-user from expensive environmental compliance costs, stemming from such initiatives as the NESHAP regulations and more specifically the MACT standards for each pollution source.
 
Validation of repeatability and scalability of P2O processors.
 
Our P2O business has been validated for repeatability and scalability by extensive testing by our customers and multiple independent tests by outside consultants and third party laboratories.
 
Intellectual Property
 
To ensure the protection of our proprietary technology, we have applied for patent protection for both the P2O process and P2O processor. As of May 2019, we have pending two United States and one Canadian applications. A lack of patent protection could have a material adverse effect on our ability to gain a competitive advantage for our process and processors, since it is possible that our competitors may be able to duplicate the P2O process for their own purposes. We also rely on our trade secrets to provide protection from portions of our process and proprietary catalyst.
 
We also hold a U.S. patent relating to our Data Business for the recovery of tape information. This was sold to 2335524Ontario Inc. on March 2, 2018.
 
We also hold three United States trademarks and are as follows:
 
(1) The standard character mark P2O®
 
(2) Miscellaneous design
 
(3) The standard character mark Plastic2Oil®
 
Research and Development
 
Given our strategic focus on developing our P2O business, we anticipate that our research and development activities related to our P2O processors and the construction, operation and systems management of those processors will decrease. Specifically, we will seek to increase the operational capabilities and performance of our P2O processors as opportunities arise. Research and development expenditures was $0 in 2018 and 2017.
Employees
 
As of May 2019, we employed three persons full-time and one person part-time, of which one were executive management, one and one half were in finance and administration, one was in operations. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our labor relations are good.

Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters
 
As we seek to further develop and commercialize our P2O business, we will be subject to extensive and frequently developing federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to those relating to emissions requirements, fuel production, fuel transportation, fuel storage, waste management, waste storage, composition of fuels and permitting. Compliance with current and future regulations could increase our operational costs. Management believes that the company is currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental regulations and permitting.
 
Our operations require various governmental permits and approvals. We believe that we have obtained, or are in the process of obtaining, all necessary permits and approvals for the operations of our P2O business; however, any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. Failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of permits and approvals or to have the necessary approvals in place may adversely affect our operations and may subject us to penalties.

PLASTI2OIL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND GOING CONCERN
 
Plastic2Oil, Inc. (the “Company” or “P2O”) was originally incorporated as 310 Holdings, Inc. (“310”) in the State of Nevada on April 20, 2006. 310 had no significant activity from inception through 2009. In April 2009, John Bordynuik purchased 63% of the issued and outstanding shares of 310. During 2009, the Company changed its name to JBI, Inc. and began operations of its main business operation, transforming waste plastics to oil and other fuel products. During 2014, the Company changed its name to Plastic2Oil, Inc. (“P2O”). P2O is a combination of proprietary technologies and processes developed by P2O which convert waste plastics into fuel. P2O currently, as of the date of this filing, has three processors at its Niagara Falls, NY facility (the “Niagara Falls Facility”). The processors have been idle since December 2013. Our P2O business has begun the transition from research and development to a commercial business that plans to grow through the licensing of technology and or from the sale of processors.
 
Presently, we do not have sufficient cash to operate our business which has forced us to suspend our operations until such time as we receive a capital infusion or cash advances on the sale of our processors.
 
Going Concern
 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern which assumes the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company has experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception, has net losses from continuing operations of $2,777,491, and $1,474,005 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and has a working capital deficit of $14,622,138 and an accumulated deficit of $82,195,628, at December 31, 2018. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and to operate in the normal course of business. The Company has funded its activities to date almost exclusively from equity financings, loans from related parties and issuance of secured long-term debt.
 
The Company will continue to require substantial funds to continue the expansion of its P2O business to achieve significant commercial productions, and to significantly increase sales and marketing efforts. Management’s plans in order to meet its operating cash flow requirements include financing activities such as private placements of its common stock, issuances of debt and convertible debt instruments.
 
While the Company believes that it will be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund its operations, meet regulatory requirements and achieve commercial production goals, there are no assurances that such additional funding will be achieved and that it will succeed in its future operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Basis of Consolidation
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Plastic2Oil of NY#1 Inc., Plastic2Oil (Canada) Inc., JBI CDE Inc., Plastic2Oil Re One Inc., JBI Re #1 Inc., Plastic2Oil Marine Inc., Javaco, and Pak-it. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Amounts in the consolidated financial statements are expressed in US dollars. Recycling Center, Pak-It and Javaco have also been consolidated.
Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates include amounts for impairment of long-lived assets, share based compensation, asset retirement obligations, inventory obsolescence, accrued liabilities, accounts receivable exposures and valuation of options and warrants.
Cash 
 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company held no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company has cash of $47,808 and $172,286, respectively.
Restricted Cash
 
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had $0 and $100,524, respectively, of restricted cash, which was used to secure a line of credit that secured a performance bond on behalf of the Company. Given the Company is no longer producing fuel, the State of New York released the bond requirement.

---

Property, Plant and Equipment
 
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets, and capital leased assets are given useful lives coinciding with the asset classification they are classified as. These lives are as follows:

Leasehold improvements | lesser of useful life or term of the lease 
------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------
Machinery and office equipment | 3-15 years 
Furniture and fixtures | 7 years 
Office and industrial buildings | 25 -30 years 

 
Gains and losses on depreciable assets retired or sold are recognized in the statements of operations in the year of disposal. Repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred and expenditures that increase the value or useful life of the asset are capitalized.
 
Construction in Process
 
The Company capitalizes customized equipment built to be used in the future day to day operations at cost. Once complete and available for use, the cost for accounting purposes is transferred to property, plant and equipment, where normal depreciation rates are applied.
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
 
The Company reviews for impairment of long-lived assets on an asset by asset basis. Impairment is recognized on properties held for use when the expected undiscounted cash flows for a property are less than its carrying amount at which time the property is written down to fair value. Properties held for sale are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected sales price less costs to sell. The sale or disposal of a “component of an entity” is treated as discontinued operations.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded impairment losses on deposits and property, plant and equipment of $635,770 and $13,158, respectively, in accordance to ASC 360-10-50-2 where an impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount of the long-lived assets are not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of its long-lived assets for impairment purposes using an undiscounted cash flow method.
 
Asset Retirement Obligations
 
The fair value of the estimated asset retirement obligation is recognized in the consolidated balance sheets when identified and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The asset retirement cost, equal to the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation, is capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived asset. The balance of the asset retirement obligation is determined through an assessment made by the Company’s engineers, of the total costs expected to be incurred by the Company when closing a facility. The total estimated cost is then discounted using the current market rates to determine the present value of the asset as of the date of this valuation. As of the date of the creation of the asset retirement obligation in the amount of $58,363, the Company determined the present value of the obligation using a discount rate equal to 2.96%. The present value of the asset retirement obligation is then capitalized on the consolidated balance sheets and is depreciated over the asset’s estimated useful life and is included in depreciation and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Increases in the asset retirement obligation resulting from the passage of time are recorded as accretion of asset retirement obligations in the consolidated statements of operations. Actual expenditures incurred are charged against the accumulated obligation. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the carrying value of the asset retirement obligations was $67,897 and $65,920, respectively. These costs include disposal of plastic and other non-hazardous waste, site closing labor and testing and sampling of the site upon closure.

F-10
----

Environmental Contingencies
 
The Company records environmental liabilities at their undiscounted amounts on our balance sheets as other current or long-term liabilities when environmental assessments indicate that remediation efforts are probable, and the costs can be reasonably estimated. These costs may be discounted to reflect the time value of money if the timing of the cash payments is fixed or reliably determinable and extends beyond a current period. Estimates of our liabilities are based on currently available facts, existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into consideration the likely effects of other societal and economic factors, and include estimates of associated legal costs. These amounts also consider prior experience in remediating contaminated sites, other companies’ clean-up experience and data released by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other organizations. Our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new circumstances. We capitalize costs that benefit future periods and we recognize a current period charge in operation and maintenance expense when clean-up efforts do not benefit future periods.
 
We evaluate any amounts paid directly or reimbursed by government sponsored programs and potential recoveries or reimbursements of remediation costs from third parties including insurance coverage separately from our liability. Recovery is evaluated based on the creditworthiness or solvency of the third party, among other factors. When recovery is assured, we record and report an asset separately from the associated liability on our balance sheets. No amounts for recovery have been accrued to date.
 

F-11
----

Foreign Currency Translation
 
The consolidated financial statements have been translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 830. All monetary items have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. All non-monetary items have been translated using the historical exchange rates at the time of transactions. Income statement amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the year. Foreign exchange of $0 and gain of $57,301 are included as general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Income Taxes
 
The Company utilizes the asset and liability method to measure and record deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

F-12
----

Loss Per Share
 
The financial statements include basic and diluted per share information. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during each period. Common stock equivalents are excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share when their effect is anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2018, potential dilutive common stock equivalents consisted 1,600,000 shares underlying common stock warrants and 220,000 shares underlying stock options, which were not included in the calculation of the diluted loss per share because their effect is anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2017, potential dilutive common stock equivalents consisted 4,850,000 shares underlying common stock warrants and 2,380,000 shares underlying stock options, which were not included in the calculation of the diluted loss per share because of their effect is anti-dilutive.
Concentrations and Credit Risk
 
Financial instruments which potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of operating demand deposit accounts and accounts receivable. The Company’s policy is to place our operating demand deposit accounts with high credit quality financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, however, account balances may at times exceed insured limits.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 two suppliers accounted for 34.3% of accounts payable.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
The carrying amounts of cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses, capital leases, and promissory notes approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items or prevailing interest rates.

F-13
----

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), that replaces existing lease guidance. Under this ASU, leases will be required to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet. This guidance is effective beginning January 1, 2019. The new standard is required to be applied with a modified retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented. The Company has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
 
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Total | $ | 3,301,179 | | $ | (1,775,261 | ) | $ | 1,525,918

 
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized $172,796, and $190,009, respectively, of depreciation expense. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, machinery and equipment with a cost of $53,257 and accumulated amortization of $53,256 and $51,355, respectively, were under capital lease. During the periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized $1,902, and $7,608, respectively, of depreciation expense related to these assets under capital lease.
 
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded impairment loss on property, plant and equipment of $635,770 and $13,158, respectively in accordance to ASC 360-10-50-2 where an impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount of the long-lived assets are not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The change in 2017 relates specifically to the sale of the 1783 Allanport property.
 
NOTE 5 - PROPERTY HELD FOR SALE
 
The Company has offered for sale its land and building of its blending site located in Thorold, Ontario. Canada. The Company no longer requires the land or building as part of its plans to either assemble and or manufacture or license its technology. The land and building are currently listed for sale and the Company anticipates a sale in less than twelve (12) months. Accordingly, these assets have been reclassified from property, plant and equipment to property held for sale in the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. The Company has determined the fair value of its property held for sale exceeds its carrying value and no valuation allowance is necessary. The net book value of the land and building of $180,235 has been presented in the accompanying balance sheet as property held for sale at December 31, 2018.

The Company calculates its income tax expense by estimating the annual effective tax rate and applying that rate to the year-to-date ordinary income (loss) at the end of the period. The Company records a tax valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that it will not be able to recover the value of its deferred tax assets. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company calculated its estimated annualized effective tax rate at 0% and 0%, respectively, for both the United States and Canada. The Company had no income tax expense on its $2,777,491 and $1,474,005 losses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued on uncertain tax positions as well as interest received from favorable tax settlements within interest expense. The Company recognizes penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits within selling, general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had no uncertain tax positions.
 
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act decreases the U.S. corporate federal income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% effective January 1, 2018. The impact of the re-measurement on the Corporation’s net deferred tax asset, as of December 31, 2017, was an approximately $7,000,000 decrease in deferred tax assets, with a corresponding decrease in the Company’s valuation allowance, and no impact on income tax expense. The Act also includes a number of other provisions including, among others, the elimination of net operating loss carrybacks and limitations on the use of future losses, the repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax regime and the repeal of the domestic production activities deduction. These provisions are not expected to have a material effect on the Corporation.
 
Given the significant complexity of the Act and anticipated additional implementation guidance from the Internal Revenue Service, further implications of the Act may be identified in future periods.
 
The Company does not anticipate any significant changes to the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months. The years ended December 31, 2014 through December 31, 2018 are open tax years.

Pursuant to a secured debt issuance on August 10, 2016, August 24, 2016 and October 25, 2016, the Company issued 600,000 warrants, to purchase shares of common stock for $0.12 per share to the holder of the secured debt. The warrants have a five year term from the date of issuance, as such the corresponding expiry dates are August 10, 2021, August 25, 2021 and October 25, 2021 respectively. The Company allocated $24,000 of the proceeds to the warrants based on their relative fair value. Such amount was recorded as a discount against the debt and is being amortized in to interest expense through the maturity date of the debt. The relative fair value of the warrants was determined on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
 
NOTE 12 – STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS AND AWARDS 
 
The Company’s 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”) provides for the issuance of stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards to members of management and key employees. The 2012 Plan is administered by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, or in the absence of a committee, the full Board of Directors of the Company. The Plan was enacted in July 2012, and prior to this time, no plan and consequently, no stock options or shares of restricted stock were granted under an equity compensation plan.
Stock Options-2012 Plan
 
There were no options granted during the year ended December 31, 2018. There were 50,000 options granted during the year ended December 31, 2017 whose fair value was deemed insignificant. For years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense (included in selling, general and administrative expense) of $22,665 and $63,170, respectively, related to stock options that vested. As of December 31, 2018, 195,000 options are vested.
Valuation of Awards
 
The per-share fair value of each stock option granted during the year ended December 31, 2017 was determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions:

 | 2017 | 
-----------------------------+------+-------
Expected life (in years) | | 7.00 | 
Risk-free interest rate | | 0.05 | %
Expected volatility | | 306.83 |

On October 25, 2016, the Board awarded Rahoul S Banerjea, the former chief financial officer 2,250,000 options to purchase shares of common stock at $0.17 per share.

At December 31, 2017, all 2,250,000 were vested and an expense of $90,000 was recognized.
