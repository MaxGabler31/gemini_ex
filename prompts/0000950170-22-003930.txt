Overview
SQZ Biotechnologies is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on unlocking the full potential of cell therapies to benefit patients with cancer, autoimmune and infectious diseases, and other serious conditions. The company was founded on the therapeutic potential of Cell Squeeze®, our proprietary technology which allows for rapid delivery of a variety of cargo into different cell types. We aim to create multiple cell therapies that drive the immune system to combat diseases.
 In oncology, we are developing cell therapy platforms that are based on directing tumor antigen-specific immune activation via engineered antigen presentation. We believe that by engineering physiological antigen presentation signals in subsets of peripheral blood cells that act on immune priming pathways, we have the potential to develop cell therapies that are designed to be potent drivers of tumor-specific immunity, well-tolerated, administered without lymphodepleting preconditioning or hospitalization, and produced in under 24 hours. We have three oncology candidates in clinical trials across our SQZ® Antigen Presenting Cell, or APC, SQZ® enhanced APC, or eAPC, and SQZ® Activating Antigen Carrier, or AAC, cell therapy platforms. In our autoimmune diseases portfolio, we are developing our SQZ® Tolerizing Antigen Carrier, or TAC, cell therapy platform with the aim to restore immune tolerance to self-antigens or other autoimmune disease-associated antigens that are central to disease pathogenesis.
In 2021, we executed on several key areas of our pipeline and advanced our APC platform objectives. As of December 31, 2021, we have dosed 20 patients in our Phase 1 trial for our lead APC candidate, SQZ-PBMC-HPV, in HPV16+ advanced solid tumors. We reported interim data from the first three monotherapy dose-escalation cohorts at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, Annual Meeting, and presented interim safety, biomarker, and clinical data from the highest dose SQZ-PBMC-HPV monotherapy cohort at the 2021 European Society for Medical Oncology Immuno-Oncology, or ESMO-IO, Congress. Key observations from the reported data include, as of a cutoff date of October 8, 2021 (n=18 patients):
 •SQZ-PBMC-HPV induced a radiographic response and led to symptomatic improvement as a monotherapy treatment in a checkpoint refractory head-and-neck cancer patient
 •Across all dose levels, there were no observed treatment-related Grade 3 or greater serious adverse events, and no patient met the dose limiting toxicity, or DLT, criteria 
 •Autologous cell therapy manufacturing was demonstrated in under 24 hours for all monotherapy patients, with multiple doses produced and an average vein-to-vein time of approximately one week
 We have advanced our trial to evaluate SQZ-PBMC-HPV in combination with checkpoint inhibitor therapies, and are continuing to enroll patients in the highest dose monotherapy cohort. We are targeting additional data in the second half of 2022.
We have continued to build upon the progress of our SQZ® APC platform through the development of the novel SQZ® eAPC platform. Our lead eAPC product candidate leverages the added capabilities and functionality of multiple antigen presentation and immunological signals achieved through multiplexed mRNA delivery to diverse immune cell types. In January 2022, we received allowance to proceed with clinical trials from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, under our Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for SQZ-eAPC-HPV, our lead eAPC candidate engineered with HPV16 antigens and costimulatory signals. We will initiate the SQZ-eAPC-HPV trial, the COMMANDER-001 Phase 1/2 study, in patients with HPV16+ advanced solid tumors in the first half

of 2022. We anticipate initial interim data in the second half of 2022. In addition to our efforts in the oncology field, we are also continuing to advance the eAPC platform in the infectious diseases field.
In January 2021, we received allowance to proceed with clinical trials from the FDA under our IND for SQZ-AAC-HPV, our lead AAC product candidate derived from red blood cells engineered with tumor-specific antigens. We are currently enrolling monotherapy cohorts as part of the Phase 1 ENVOY-001 trial to assess safety and tolerability as well as secondary outcome measures of the investigational SQZ-AAC-HPV therapy in HPV16+ advanced solid tumors, with initial interim data targeted in the second half of 2022.
We are also advancing our SQZ® TAC platform focused on creating novel and proprietary cell therapies as it relates to modulating or restoring immune tolerance. We have selected Celiac disease as the first proposed autoimmune indication for SQZ® TAC platform development. We believe the evidence of a causal disease antigen and T-cell driven pathology, and the substantial unmet need for a tolerizing treatment option provide a compelling opportunity for us to pursue Celiac disease. We presented characterization of TAC-mediated mechanisms of antigen-specific tolerance in preclinical models at the 2021 Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies, or FOCIS, Meeting. We anticipate further development of our TAC-Celiac candidate through IND-enabling studies in 2022 to support an IND submission in the first half of 2023, and, in parallel, are planning to use our proprietary, point-of-care manufacturing system for the production of the clinical batches.
We believe that we can leverage our foundational Cell Squeeze® technology and our associated manufacturing systems, processes and capabilities, to enable our current and future therapeutic product candidates and to potentially improve the speed and reliability of cell therapy manufacturing beyond current practices. During our Phase 1 clinical trial, we have demonstrated the ability to manufacture our lead APC therapeutic candidate in under 24 hours, with a vein-to-vein time of approximately one week, and we have progressed a multi-functional cell therapy, through our eAPC platform, into clinical testing. Additionally, we continue to progress development of an automated, point-of-care manufacturing system that we believe has the potential to produce future therapeutic candidates with improved manufacturing efficiency and lower cost.
 Oncology
 We believe our oncology cell therapy approach, which utilizes our clinical-scale microfluidic Cell Squeeze® system for cytosolic delivery of diverse cell programming biomolecules, has the potential to confer several advantages, including:
•the potential to activate potent tumor-specific CD8+ T cell responses as encoded by the target antigen cargo; 
 •multiplexed engineering of combinations of costimulatory and cytokine molecules that are designed to enhance stimulation and expansion of effector cells at the immune synapse; and 
 •potential for rapid and reliable manufacturing of engineered peripheral blood cell products in under 24 hours 
 Across our platforms, we believe our SQZ® cell therapy candidates have the potential for broad development spanning solid and hematological cancer types as a result of the different disease antigen cargo that can be squeezed into multiple cell types to drive targeted killing of tumor cells.
We are developing three oncology therapeutic candidates with unique product characteristics and mechanistic benefits based on the principles of antigen-specific immune stimulation:
SQZ® Antigen Presenting Cell Platform: The APC platform is focused on generating CD8+ T cell responses, which are known to be the driving force for adaptive immune responses, and when present in tumor tissue, are a powerful prognostic indicator for multiple tumor types. SQZ®APCs are created by ex vivo engineering of a patient’s own peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or PBMCs, with specific tumor antigens to develop antigen presenting cells that, when administered to a patient, are designed to drive activation and proliferation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells for antitumor activity. Through our Cell Squeeze® approach, which is designed to enable direct cytosolic delivery of peptide antigens, we believe that we can dramatically improve antigen presentation efficiency. We are currently enrolling patients in

monotherapy and combination cohorts in the Phase 1 trial for SQZ-PBMC-HPV and announced interim clinical results in December 2021. Our findings demonstrated that SQZ-PBMC-HPV induced a radiographic response, led to symptomatic improvement, and showed CD8+ immune activity in a solid tumor patient, providing preliminary support for the potential cellular vaccine mechanism.
SQZ® Enhanced APC Platform: The eAPC platform has the potential to yield novel multi-engineered cell therapy candidates comprising antigenic, costimulatory and cytokine components. SQZ® eAPCs are designed to potentially augment the T cell activation signal and to elicit a polyclonal T cell response. In addition, eAPCs are engineered with mRNAs that encode full-length antigenic proteins, potentially eliminating existing HLA restrictions with the intent to substantially broaden the addressable patient population. Our first eAPC platform candidate, SQZ-eAPC-HPV, was developed by multiplexed engineering of PBMCs with five different mRNAs. We received allowance to initiate Phase 1/2 clinical testing from the FDA under our IND in January 2022.
SQZ® Activating Antigen Carrier Platform: SQZ® AACs are derived from engineering red blood cells, or RBCs, with the Cell Squeeze® technology to comprise tumor-specific antigens and adjuvant. AACs are designed to take advantage of the natural physiological process of aged RBC clearance to target resident, professional APCs in lymphoid organs that can subsequently prime endogenous T cells to drive antitumor activity. We are currently enrolling patients in the Phase 1 ENVOY-001 trial for the SQZ-AAC-HPV investigational therapy in HPV16+ advanced or metastatic tumors.
In addition to our ongoing clinical programs, in various preclinical studies, we demonstrated the potential of SQZ® APCs and AACs to elicit specific immune responses against a range of oncology targets, including non-viral antigens such as KRAS point mutants. We presented preclinical data for SQZ® APCs directed against KRAS G12D and G12V antigens, which are prevalent mutations in lung, colorectal and pancreatic cancers, at the American Association for Cancer Research, or AACR, 2021 Annual Meeting. We plan to continue IND-enabling activities in KRAS mutant tumors in 2022.
Autoimmune Diseases
 We are developing our SQZ® Tolerizing Antigen Carrier platform with the aim to treat autoimmune diseases by inducing antigen-specific immune tolerance. Our TACs are derived from engineering RBCs to comprise disease-specific antigens and are designed to leverage the natural physiological process of aged RBC clearance. SQZ® TACs have demonstrated the potential to induce multiple mechanisms of immune tolerance, including the deletion of disease-driving T cells, in preclinical mouse models. We are targeting clinical development of our investigational TAC Celiac candidate manufactured with our point-of-care system. We plan to conduct IND-enabling activities in 2022 to support an IND submission in the first half of 2023.
Infectious Diseases
 We believe our SQZ® APC, eAPC and AAC platforms have the potential to provide therapeutic benefit by driving antigen-specific immune responses in chronic and acute infectious disease settings. In preclinical studies, we have demonstrated the versatility of our APCs to elicit targeted CD8+ T cell activation for multiple well-known disease antigens, including in hepatitis B virus, or HBV, cytomegalovirus, or CMV, influenza A virus, or IAV, and simian immunodeficiency virus, or SIV. Chronic HBV represents a large patient population with significant unmet need, and clinical evidence suggests that the levels of virus-specific T cells are correlated with patient outcomes and disease control. As such, we believe it to be a promising indication to target with our SQZ® eAPCs. We plan to continue preclinical work of our eAPC program in chronic HBV in 2022.

Company History
Our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Armon Sharei, is the lead inventor of the Cell Squeeze® technology. This foundational technology is based on his prior team’s work in the laboratories of Dr. Klavs Jensen and Dr. Robert Langer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In a series of experiments with a complex, high-pressure, fluid-jet delivery system, the team discovered that rapid mechanical deformation of cells enables intracellular delivery of biomaterials, resulting in the first prototype of the SQZ® microfluidic chip. Through collaboration with leading scientists in the immunology and regenerative medicine fields, the team discovered the process’ novel capabilities and potential for significant impact through engineering of cell biology and function. SQZ Biotechnologies was founded with the goal of realizing the broad potential of this technology and developing cellular medicines that are effective and well-tolerated, with improved therapeutic accessibility, for patients around the world.
Our Strategy
Our vision is to build a fully integrated cell therapy company leveraging the Cell Squeeze® technology to develop differentiated, engineered cellular therapies across a broad range of disease areas. We plan to develop, and if approved, commercialize, cellular therapeutics from our directed immunity platforms that can modulate targeted immune responses against cancer, autoimmune and infectious diseases. To enable a future with impactful SQZ® cell therapy products as compelling early-line treatment options for patients, we are executing a strategy with the following key elements:
•Advance HPV-specific cell therapies for the treatment of HPV-associated solid tumor malignancies. We believe that HPV+ cancers represent a promising lead application for our directed immunity platforms as the HPV16 viral oncogenes have been shown to be highly immunogenic and central to disease pathogenesis. Despite this, the mainstay first-line treatments do not differentially treat the underlying viral cause of HPV+ tumors. We have a multi-platform strategy to target HPV16+ cancers, aimed at priming and activating T cell responses that can drive antitumor immunity. The first prong of 


our strategy is to develop our ex vivo engineered APC candidate, SQZ-PBMC-HPV, where we are enrolling monotherapy and combination cohorts with checkpoint inhibitors in the ongoing clinical trial. We also intend to advance clinical development of SQZ-eAPC-HPV, a multi-functional antigen presenting therapy with engineered immune activation signals, in monotherapy and potential combination treatment settings. In parallel, we are developing SQZ-AAC-HPV, which utilizes a distinct immune activation approach to generate antigen presentation in vivo to prime endogenous T cells. We are currently enrolling patients with recurrent or metastatic HPV16+ cancers, including head-and-neck, cervical, and anal tumor types, in ongoing Phase 1 and planned Phase 1/2 trials. In current and future cohorts across our studies, we plan to evaluate our cell therapy candidates in combination with approved therapies as our preclinical studies indicate the potential for synergistic benefit with immune checkpoint inhibitors and/or chemotherapeutic agents. A combinatory approach could enable us to potentially reach a wider patient population at earlier lines of therapy, with the broader goal of improving standard of care treatment options for HPV+ cancer patients.
•Broaden and deepen our pipeline by expanding to additional disease antigen targets within oncology as well as autoimmune and infectious disease areas. We are encouraged by initial observations and progress in the ongoing clinical trial of SQZ-PBMC-HPV in HPV+ tumors, and we plan to continue to advance the research and development of future product candidates directed against solid tumor, autoimmune and infectious disease targets with high unmet need. In preclinical studies, our directed immunity platforms focused on antigen-specific immune activation have demonstrated the potential to generate CD8+ T cell responses against multiple tumor antigens, including KRAS G12D and G12V epitopes, in addition to several infectious disease antigens associated with HBV, CMV, SIV and influenza. We believe the applicability of our therapeutic approach positions us to potentially pursue a wide range of antigenic targets across indication categories. We plan to leverage our core capabilities and expertise across antigen composition development and product optimization, our manufacturing system and processes, and our next-generation therapeutic platform advancements to further innovate and grow our future product portfolio. 
 •Continue to strengthen our next-generation therapeutic platform technologies to develop cellular medicines with greater therapeutic impact potential. We are motivated by the possibility of expanding the therapeutic breadth of cell therapies through creating product candidates that are designed to be well-tolerated, have an increased therapeutic index, be rapid and reliable to manufacture, be streamlined to administer without preconditioning or hospitalization, and address unmet needs of global patient populations. We recently advanced our lead eAPC platform candidate, SQZ-eAPC-HPV, an mRNA-engineered cell therapy candidate designed with multiple antigenic, costimulatory and cytokine components, into a Phase 1/2 trial for HLA-agnostic, HPV16+ patient populations. In addition, we are pursuing additional exploratory initiatives, including engineering novel signaling functions and reprogramming cell phenotypes, to complement and diversify our therapeutic portfolio opportunities. 
 •Invest in our innovative manufacturing capabilities and advance our point-of-care system. We have developed proprietary manufacturing processes in compliance with applicable current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, with our Cell Squeeze® platform, which we believe is a critical competitive advantage in the cell therapy field and a potential driver of our long-term success. Our clinical Cell Squeeze® system is applicable across our SQZ® cell therapy product candidates along with customization changes. We plan to continue investing resources to advance and innovate our existing manufacturing processes and systems with the goal of further reducing manufacturing time and cost, while upholding key product quality attributes. We are also developing an automated, point-of-care system that could streamline manufacturing time, labor, and logistics, enabling the potential for greater accessibility and patient impact of our cell therapy candidates, if approved. Our vision is to potentially generate patient doses for cell therapy candidates at or near specific treatment centers, thus significantly improving the patient experience. We have demonstrated initial engineering feasibility for engineered cells derived from PBMCs or RBCs on our point-of-care prototype. Further development is ongoing to enable future implementation across our cell therapy platforms. 
 •Opportunistically collaborate with strategic partners to realize the full potential of our pipeline and Cell SqueezeⓇ technology. While we intend to establish our own fully integrated internal capabilities to develop and commercialize our product candidates, we may selectively pursue and form strategic 


collaborations or partnerships to accelerate our development timelines, expand the therapeutic reach of our SQZ® platforms and capitalize on the broad potential of the Cell Squeeze® technology. We have a longstanding collaboration with Roche for the development of SQZ® APCs in oncology, through a partnership that began in 2015 and which was subsequently expanded in 2018.
SQZ® Technology
We have developed the Cell Squeeze® technology to be a rapid and versatile method of biomolecule delivery to cells, and have demonstrated application of our clinical-scale Cell Squeeze® system to reliably yield patient dose production timelines of under 24 hours for our investigational SQZ-PBMC-HPV therapeutic candidate. As illustrated below, the Cell Squeeze® approach utilizes microfluidic mechanical deformation which facilitates squeezing cells at high speeds through constriction(s) to temporarily disrupt the cell membrane and allow the target cargo to enter directly into the cytosol. At the current clinical scale, our proprietary system processes over 10 billion patient cells per minute.



We believe there are several advantages of utilizing the Cell Squeeze® technology as the manufacturing foundation of our cell therapy product candidates:
 ●Translation across different cell types. Our technology has demonstrated desired cytosolic delivery with over 25 mammalian cell types tested to date. We have created a library of SQZ® chips designed to perform with different cell populations that can be readily configured for use in our manufacturing systems. We believe this flexible configuration could help avoid costly cell expansion steps by potentially allowing us to leverage easier to access or manipulate cells. As a result, we believe this could enable us to potentially expand the breadth of indications we may consider for our cell therapy platforms.
 ●Versatility across cargo materials. Utilizing the Cell Squeeze® system, we have achieved intracellular delivery of peptides, proteins, small molecules, nucleic acids, and gene-editing complexes. Many of these material classes, such as proteins and peptides, are challenging to deliver with existing techniques. In addition, we can introduce multiple distinct materials into cells in a single squeeze run, allowing us to develop differentiated cell therapy candidates that include multiplexed engineering of different cellular functions, as leveraged in SQZ® eAPCs. 
 ●Preservation of cell health and function. Evidence from our preclinical studies supports our belief that intracellular delivery with the Cell Squeeze® technology does not result in substantial transcriptomic, phenotypic, and functional alterations, which we believe could translate to cell therapy product candidates with the potential to offer improved manufacturability, activity, and viability. In the context of human T cells and hematopoietic stem cells in preclinical models, we observed minimal gene expression misregulation from squeezing relative to electroporation, and, additionally, identified that electroporation-mediated functional side effects persisted for up to several days. 
 ●Scalability and operational practicality. The underlying physical principles of intracellular delivery with the Cell Squeeze® technology have enabled us to design and adapt our systems and instrumentation to 


perform at clinical and potentially commercial scale, for the development of cell therapy product candidates. Our proprietary SQZ® chip, an integral component of the current Cell Squeeze® system, has demonstrated the ability to process up to 10 billion patient cells per minute. We believe that our manufacturing processes developed with current and future iterations of the Cell Squeeze® system support our ability to improve manufacturing efficiency and costs for our product candidates.
Our Differentiation
 We believe our technologies, capabilities, and knowledge pertaining to the fields of cell engineering and immunology position us with the potential to create cell therapy candidates with differentiated and favorable product profiles for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune and infectious diseases. We believe our cell therapy platforms and product candidates have the potential to offer meaningful benefits to patients and have broad therapeutic scope based on the following advantages:
 ●Potential to immunologically target fundamental drivers of disease. By engineering antigen presentation in a physiologically relevant manner, our therapeutic candidates are designed to generate immune responses that can potentially activate and expand endogenous T cells for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases, or that can potentially delete and anergize disease-driving T cells for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. In our oncology programs, for example, the CD8+ T cell responses generated by our SQZ® APC and AAC platforms have targeted specific tumor antigens, such as HPV E6 and E7 or KRAS mutants, to effectuate tumor regression in preclinical models. In addition, our directed immunity approach allows us to potentially access intracellular disease antigen targets to modulate immunity, which we believe is a key advantage to addressing tumor subsets and disease areas that are otherwise challenging to treat. 
 ●Integration of multiple functions in a single product candidate. We have developed the technology advancements, expertise, and design approaches to engineer multiple cell types, including PBMCs and RBCs, with proprietary antigenic compositions and combinations of biomolecules to potentially enable diverse therapeutic functions. Our eAPC platform represents a recent accomplishment to advance a next-generation cell therapeutic candidate into clinical testing, which involved multiplexed engineering of 5 different mRNAs into immune cells for the purposes of increasing the activation strength and durability of potential T cell responses against disease. 
 ●Potential for favorable safety and tolerability. We believe that there are several distinguishing features to our therapeutic strategy and cell engineering approach that enable us to potentially create product candidates with the potential for favorable safety and tolerability outcomes. By acting on immune priming pathways to modulate endogenous effector cells, we believe we can circumvent the need for lymphodepleting conditioning which is commonly used in many current cell therapy treatment regimens and associated with significant toxicities to patients. Moreover, our current product candidates do not rely on genetic modifications to cells or treatment with viral vectors, potentially eliminating long-term safety concerns arising from unintended consequences to DNA disruption. We believe that this, coupled with our low cost-per-dose manufacturing, create the potential for the development of our SQZ® therapeutic candidates into earlier lines of therapy.
 ●Rapid, reliable, and flexible manufacturing of cell therapies. We have demonstrated rapid clinical manufacturing in under 24 hours via our Cell Squeeze® clinical system for our SQZ-PBMC-HPV investigational candidate, and in addition, we believe that common elements of our established manufacturing processes enable us to potentially streamline future development timelines. We believe that eliminating the need for viral vectors and multi-day manufacturing could dramatically cut costs relative to current cell therapies and enable expansion into areas where current cell engineering approaches are cost prohibitive. We anticipate manufacturing costs for SQZ-PBMC-HPV could be approximately 10 times lower per dose at commercial scale compared to currently marketed cell therapies. In future iterations, our point-of-care system could potentially reduce costs even further.
 SQZ® Cell Therapy Platforms
Our cell therapy platforms are designed to modulate the immune system in a target-specific manner with applications in oncology, autoimmune and infectious diseases, and other serious conditions. We are developing platforms and product candidates based on two modalities: targeted immune activation (SQZ® APCs, eAPCs and

AACs) and immune tolerization (SQZ® TACs). We believe our multi-platform strategy positions us to harness complementary mechanistic attributes and value creation pathways in the development of our product candidates, while building on established manufacturing competencies and platform technology advancements.

 Our Manufacturing
 Since our founding, we have invested in and advanced our Cell Squeeze® platform, which includes our proprietary Cell Squeeze® technology, methods, and systems, with the aim to enable a variety of cell engineering applications for the development of cell therapy product candidates. We believe that the ability to manufacture cell therapies rapidly and reliably is an important competitive advantage in the cell therapy field, and we continue to innovate our manufacturing systems, processes, and capabilities with the intent to decrease the time, cost and complexity associated with cell therapy production.

With our current clinical-scale Cell Squeeze® system and associated manufacturing processes, we have demonstrated patient dose production times of under 24 hours and vein-to-vein times of approximately one week for our SQZ-PBMC-HPV therapeutic candidate. Our current manufacturing and release testing workflow is represented in the figure below.
   
   We are also developing an automated, point-of-care system that could potentially streamline manufacturing and future product candidate development timelines, furthering our broader vision to improve the accessibility and patient impact potential of cell therapies. We are targeting initial clinical implementation of our point-of-care manufacturing system with our TAC platform in 2023 and are continuing to develop our latest generation system to potentially enable future implementation across our other cell therapy platforms.

 SQZ® Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) Platform
APC Platform Overview
The SQZ® APC platform is designed to generate tumor-specific CD8+ T cell activation to drive the antitumor immune response. CD8+ T cells are known to be important effectors of the adaptive immune system, and are foundational to the recent clinical success of immunotherapy in oncologic indications.
While there has been significant interest in therapeutic immunization approaches to prime CD8+ T cell responses in an antigen-specific manner, it has remained challenging to effectuate adequate responses for antitumor applications. We believe that our approach, utilizing Cell Squeeze® delivery, enables us to engineer antigen presentation in multiple peripheral blood cell types to create a cellular vaccine that has the potential to direct antigen-specific immunity.
To mount an immune response, CD8+ T cells require antigen presentation on major histocompatibility complex class I, or MHC-I, molecules by APCs. Antigenic peptides displayed on MHC-I are primarily sourced from the cytosol. Traditionally, antigen-targeted cell therapies and vaccine systems, which introduce antigens in the extracellular vicinity, have relied on a process called cross-presentation to route to the MHC-I pathway. Cross-presentation can generally be considered an ineffective mechanism of MHC-I presentation to CD8+ T cells, as typically only a fraction of introduced antigen material is present in the cytosol for MHC-I loading. In contrast, in

preclinical studies, our microfluidic Cell Squeeze® technology demonstrated abilities to deliver a variety of antigens directly into the cytosol, enabling potent antigen presentation for CD8+ T cell priming. We presented in vitro potency data for our SQZ®APCs at the American Association for Cancer Research, or AACR, 2019 Annual Meeting, where we demonstrated Cell Squeeze®-mediated cytosolic delivery yielded 1000-fold more efficient CD8+ activation relative to cross-presentation in dendritic cells.



Through accessing the MHC-I antigen presentation pathway in a physiological manner, we believe we can activate CD8-driven adaptive immunity against targeted diseases. Based on our preclinical research, we believe the SQZ® APC platform has the potential to achieve several coordinates of a T cell response:
 ●High quantity of activated T cells due to the proliferation process that T cells undergo in vivo after priming by APCs
 ●High specificity based on the antigen-specific mechanism of effector T cell activation, rather than with broad stimulation by systemic immune agonists
 ●High quality of functional T cells that are capable of tumor infiltration and targeted cytotoxic activity
 In addition, we believe that our differentiated approach could potentially provide several therapeutic benefits, including rapid generation of targeted antigen-presenting cells through engineering of major PBMC cell types, improved tolerability due to the specific and directed nature of immune activation, and synergistic opportunities with other immune-oncology agents to remodel the tumor microenvironment and promote T cell tumor infiltration.
SQZ® APC Pipeline in Oncology
 Our lead APC candidate, SQZ-PBMC-HPV, is an autologous, PBMC product engineered with HPV16 E6 and E7 synthetic long peptides for therapeutic applications in HPV16+ tumors. We are developing oncology product candidates from our APC platform in collaboration with Roche, whereby we and Roche will alternate U.S. commercial rights for each oncology product developed, and we maintain full commercial rights for our SQZ® APCs outside of oncology.
 We believe that APCs can have broad therapeutic potential across a range of solid cancers, and that we can utilize current and future generations of our cell therapy platform to target a variety of tumor antigens with the aim to drive antitumor immunity. In preclinical studies, we have demonstrated the potential of APCs to generate functional T cell responses across multiple antigen target categories, including virally derived antigens, such as HPV, that are known to be highly immunogenic and point mutants, such as KRAS G12D and G12V, that are considered less immunogenic.
We intend to apply the insights gained from the development of our first product candidate to inform future clinical development pathways and to select future indications for pipeline expansion. In addition, we believe that the advancements that we have made on our cell engineering capabilities and our manufacturing platform could enable us to leverage common processes to potentially accelerate future product development opportunities, such as in KRAS mutant cancers.
Lead SQZ®APC Product Candidate: SQZ-PBMC-HPV
HPV+ Cancers Incidence and Unmet Need
 Human papillomavirus, or HPV, infection causes some of the most common types of cancer, such as cervical and head and neck cancer, and there is significant need for new treatment options to address HPV+ tumors. According to the Centers for Disease Control , or CDC, in the United States, HPV+ tumors represent 3% of all cancers in women and 2% of all cancers in men, resulting in over 36,000 new cases of HPV+ tumors every year. HPV+ tumors represent 4.5% of all cancers worldwide, according to the International Journal of Cancer, resulting in 570,000 new cases for women and 60,000 new cases for men globally every year. According to the CDC, HPV infection plays a significant role in the formation of more than 90% of anal and cervical cancers, and most cases of vaginal (75%), oropharyngeal (70%), vulval (70%) and penile (60%) cancers. In addition, an increasing percentage of head and neck cancer is being attributed to HPV infection, particularly those arising from the oropharynx.
The standard first-line treatment for HPV+ cancers differs by tumor type but typically involves a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and more recently, in certain HPV-associated tumor types, specific checkpoint inhibitors and molecular targeted therapies. However, in patients with recurrent, metastatic, or persistent disease, second-line treatment options are limited with deterioration in response rates and prognosis. For example, in recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, or HNSCC, patients who have progressed during or after platinum-containing chemotherapy, the median overall survival is under 9 months.


Preclinical Data for SQZ-PBMC-HPV in Solid Tumors
 SQZ-PBMC-HPV demonstrated antitumor activity in murine models, and we believe these results suggest the potential for clinical benefit in patient populations with HPV+ cancers.
In November 2020, we presented the following key preclinical findings for SQZ-PBMC-HPV at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, or SITC, Annual Meeting:
 ●SQZ-PBMC-HPV promoted expansion and intratumoral infiltration of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and was more potent than the combination of HPV E7 synthetic long peptide and CpG adjuvant. 
 

In a TC-1 murine tumor model, we observed pronounced tumor regression in the SQZ® APC-treated mice (n=15), while tumor growth persisted in the inactive control (n=30) and the E7 peptide vaccine (n=15) groups. We observed that the tumors of SQZ® APC-treated mice were made up of an average of 47% immune cells, as compared to only 20% in the peptide vaccine-treated mice, and 9% in the inactive control, as measured by CD45+ cells. Of those immune cells that are CD8+ T cells, an average of 87% of them were HPV-specific for the SQZ-treated mice, compared to only 33% in the peptide vaccine-treated mice and only 2% for the inactive control. In these experiments, the peptide vaccine contained ~15,000 times more antigen than the APCs, which we believe further supports the potential potency of the SQZ® APC platform.

●SQZ-PBMC-HPV demonstrated synergistic and durable tumor reduction when combined with a bispecific anti-Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (anti-PD1) and interleukin 2 variant (IL2v) agent. 
 
In the SQZ-PBMC-HPV alone group, 17% of TC-1 mice remained tumor free on Day 84. 100% of the mice that received the combination of SQZ-PBMC-HPV and PD1-IL2v were tumor free at Day 84. In contrast, all the mice in the untreated group and the PD1-IL2v groups had grown tumors and died by Day 45. Pharmacodynamic markers correlated with the efficacy we observed, as SQZ-PBMC-HPV immunization resulted in a 480-fold increase in tumor infiltration of E7-specific CD8+ T cells, and this increase was augmented by subsequent PD1-IL2v administration.
 In December 2021, we presented additional preclinical data for SQZ-PBMC-HPV at our ESMO I-O company conference call and webcast:
 ●SQZ-PBMC-HPV exhibited synergistic anti-tumor activity in combination with cisplatin, a common chemotherapeutic agent used in clinical settings for multiple HPV-associated cancers. 



In a TC-1 murine tumor model, SQZ-PBMC-HPV plus cisplatin (5 mg/kg) resulted in enhanced tumor regression as compared to SQZ-PBMC-HPV and cisplatin alone regimens (n=10 per group).
Clinical Development of SQZ-PBMC-HPV in Solid Tumors
 SQZ-PBMC-HPV is being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of HPV16+ recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic solid tumors. The trial is an open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion study to determine the safety and tolerability, immunogenic effects, antitumor activity, and pharmacodynamics of SQZ-PBMC-HPV as monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, including atezolizumab, ipilimumab and nivolumab. The clinical trial has a flexible design to allow for additional potential combinations. We believe that positive data from this trial could support our development of a new differentiated treatment for patients with HPV16+ tumors.
The primary objectives of the trial are to measure and evaluate: 1) safety and tolerability, as assessed by the number of participants with treatment-related adverse events, 2) the recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D, of SQZ-PBMC-HPV monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors as included in the study, and 3) antitumor activity of SQZ-PBMC-HPV monotherapy at the RP2D, based on tumor assessments using RECIST 1.1. The secondary objectives of the trial are to measure and evaluate: 1) antitumor activity in patients with recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic solid tumors, and 2) manufacturing feasibility, as assessed by individual patient batch yields.
 As of December 31, 2021, we have completed the monotherapy dose escalation portion of our Phase 1 trial for SQZ-PBMC-HPV and received the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, endorsement for advancement of our highest dose regimen into combination cohorts with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We are currently enrolling patients in combination cohorts and are continuing SQZ-PBMC-HPV monotherapy enrollment at the RP2D (5e6/kg double prime).

Double prime regimen: Dosing at respective level on Day 0 and Day 1 followed by one dose every three weeks thereafter
 In December 2021, we presented initial interim results from the monotherapy dose escalation portion of the SQZ-PBMC-HPV-101 trial in HPV16+ solid tumors at the ESMO I-O Congress. Our clinical data was reported for four monotherapy dose cohorts (n=18) in an advanced patient population with a median of four prior lines of therapy. The interim results demonstrated that SQZ-PBMC-HPV was well-tolerated and in the highest dose cohort, induced a radiographic response, and led to symptomatic improvement and CD8+ T cell infiltration in an advanced patient, which we believe is supportive of potential correlative benefit and of the proposed cellular vaccine mechanism. Additionally, all SQZ-PBMC-HPV patient batches were produced in under 24 hours with high viability. A summary of key findings, as of a cutoff date of October 8, 2021, are as follows:
 ●Across all dose levels, no treatment-related Grade 3 or greater serious adverse events, or AEs, or dose-limiting toxicities were observed (n=18). 
 
One patient in Cohort 1 (0.5e6/kg) experienced grade 2 cytokine release syndrome, or CRS, which was classified as a treatment-related serious AE and resolved in under 24 hours. There was one Grade ≥3 related adverse event, Grade 3 anemia, observed in a Cohort 2 (2.5e6/kg) patient. AEs of special interest, as defined by those related to SQZ-PBMC-HPV mechanism of action, included one case of CRS and one case of infusion related reaction, or IRR, both of which were low grade events. We believe that these interim SQZ-PBMC-HPV safety and tolerability data, coupled with the potential removal of conventional lymphodepletion preconditioning, could support opportunities to transition to earlier-line patient populations for this and future APC product candidates.
●In the highest dose cohort (5e6/kg double prime; n=5 evaluable for efficacy), an advanced head-and-neck cancer patient exhibited a radiographic response and showed symptomatic improvement following treatment with SQZ-PBMC-HPV. 
 15



The patient, who was refractory to anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor treatment, showed a complete response of the target lesion at the first two on-treatment radiographic assessments, and experienced an improvement in symptoms, including dysphagia. At the second on-treatment tumor assessment, despite continuing improvement of the target lesion and patient symptoms, a new dermal lesion was found in the previously irradiated region.
Several immune and histologic biomarkers that characterize the tumor immune phenotype support the potential mechanistic action of the APC product candidate. Among those observed included an 8-fold increase in tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells (CD8+ TILs; CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes), a substantial reduction in HPV16 E6 and E7-expressing tumor cells, and a 50-fold increase in PD-L1-positive tumor cells, which are indicative of induced tumor inflammation and HPV antigen-specific targeting.

Patient 17 matched tumor biopsies
 ●We observed increases in certain patient CD8+ TILs following treatment with SQZ-PBMC-HPV, ranging from 2-fold (0.5e6/kg) to 8-fold (5e6/kg double prime). 
 


Survival follow-up: Patient 2 and 7 survival days at the time of data cut-off of October 8, 2021. Patient 17 survival days at the time of last dose.
 We believe CD8+ TILs are a potentially relevant pharmacodynamic biomarker based on supportive evidence in the scientific literature, suggesting the potential for a strong correlation between increases in CD8+ TILs and clinical responses when patients are treated with immunotherapies and the prognostic role of CD8+ TILs for multiple tumor types.
 ●The median manufacturing time for SQZ-PBMC-HPV was 17 hours across all patient lots (n=18) with a median viability of 91%. A median of 5 doses was available for each patient in the highest dose cohort from a single leukapheresis, which we believe is supportive of our manufacturing efficiency and reliability. 
 Based on these interim data, we plan to continue enrollment for our highest dose SQZ-PBMC-HPV monotherapy cohort and combination cohorts with checkpoint inhibitor therapies. We anticipate additional data for SQZ-PBMC-HPV in the second half of 2022.
SQZ® Enhanced Antigen Presenting Cell (eAPC) Platform
 eAPC Platform Overview
 The SQZ® eAPC platform is designed to build on the biology of APCs by incorporating additional immune activation signals, such as costimulatory proteins (Signal 2) and cytokines (Signal 3), into the antigen presenting cells in an effort to create novel, multi-functional cell therapy product candidates for driving antitumor immunity.



SQZ® eAPCs are generated through the engineering of patient B cells, T cells, Natural killer, or NK, cells, and monocytes with 5 mRNAs encoding antigen-specific and immunological functions in a single Cell Squeeze® step. We believe that our eAPC platform has the potential to provide several therapeutic benefits, including:
 •Presentation of a greater repertoire of antigenic epitopes (Signal 1) to CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, with the aim to remove existing human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restrictions and broaden immune recognition of tumor cells
 •Expression of costimulatory molecules, such as CD86, that may synergize with antigen presentation to promote T cell activation, expansion, and survival
 •Expression of proprietary, membrane-bound versions of cytokines, such as IL-2 and IL-12, that can potentially augment T cell proliferation to effector phenotypes, while reducing the toxicity risks associated with systemic administration of cytokines
 We believe that our approach to engineering PBMCs as eAPCs has the potential to represent an advancement over previous antigen-specific methods by augmenting the quantity, quality, and breadth of targeted T cell responses, and by integrating multiple immunological functions into a single therapeutic.
Preclinical Development of SQZ-eAPC-HPV in Solid Tumors
 Our lead eAPC product candidate, SQZ-eAPC-HPV, is engineered with mRNA cargo encoding the full-length HPV16 E6 and E7 antigenic proteins, and is in development for the treatment of HPV16+ tumors. Additionally, SQZ-eAPC-HPV is designed to express CD86 as a costimulatory molecule for T cell activation, as well as proprietary, membrane-bound versions of IL-2 and IL-12 (mbIL-2 and mb-IL-12) in an effort to further potentiate T cell activation and expansion. Our IND for a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to study SQZ-eAPC-HPV was allowed to proceed by the FDA in January 2022.
In November 2021, we presented preclinical data for SQZ-eAPC-HPV at the SITC Annual Meeting, where we demonstrated the following:
 ●SQZ-eAPC-HPV generated HPV16-specific CD8+ T cell responses, as measured by a substantial increase in stimulated CD8+ T cells relative to PBMCs with E6 and E7 mRNA and to PBMCs with CD86, mbIL-2 and mbIL-12 mRNA.
 


HPV16 E6 and E7 TCR-transduced CD8+ T cells were cultured for 6 days with autologous PBMCs that were squeezed in the presence of E6 and E7 mRNA and/or CD86, mbIL-2 and mbIL-12 mRNA. CD8+ T cells were restimulated with the E6 or E7 minimal epitopes, and intracellular cytokine staining for IFNγ was conducted to measure the expansion of HPV16-specific T cells.
Clinical Development of SQZ-eAPC-HPV in Solid Tumors
 We plan to enroll adult patients in the Phase 1/2 COMMANDER-001 trial for SQZ-eAPC-HPV in recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic HPV16+ solid tumors. The trial is an open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, immunogenic effects, antitumor activity, and pharmacodynamics of SQZ-eAPC-HPV as monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, including pembrolizumab. By not requiring any HLA inclusion criteria in the study, we expect to increase patient eligibility by approximately two- to three-fold. We anticipate initial interim data for SQZ-eAPC-HPV in the second half of 2022.
SQZ® Activating Antigen Carrier (AAC) Platform
AAC Platform Overview
The SQZ® AAC platform is designed to induce antigen presentation in vivo by deriving antigen carriers from engineering RBCs with tumor-specific antigens and adjuvant. Through replicating the physiological process of aged RBC clearance, engineered AACs are designed to act as a “Trojan horse” to deliver the tumor-specific antigen cargo and adjuvant components to endogenous antigen presenting cells in lymphoid compartments, to subsequently prime antitumor responses.
      
To stimulate the adaptive immune system against specific antigens to yield CD8+ T cells with antitumor activity, we believe sufficient delivery of target antigens to APCs in an activating context is needed to enable MHC loading and T cell priming in lymphoid organs. While one arm of our directed immunity approach is based on ex vivo generation

of APCs, the AAC arm focuses on leveraging the natural process of aged RBC clearance to target resident, professional APC populations in vivo to drive antigen-specific activation. In preclinical studies, we have shown that AACs were rapidly taken up by professional APCs, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, or DCs, in the spleen and liver, and that AACs loaded with target antigens and adjuvant subsequently drove antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. At the 2020 SITC Annual Meeting, we presented murine data on the in vivo pharmacokinetics and functional activity of SQZ® AAC therapeutic immunization, which we believe support the potential of AACs as a differentiated, directed immunity platform.


We believe that current and future AAC product candidates could confer favorable attributes for a cellular therapy, including the potential for improved tolerability due to the physiological and targeted nature of immune activation, a more streamlined patient experience with whole blood collection without the need for leukapheresis and with administration via syringe push, and the potential for synergistic benefit with other immune-oncology and chemotherapeutic agents.
AAC Pipeline in Oncology
 Our lead AAC candidate, SQZ-AAC-HPV, is an autologous, engineered RBC product candidate with HPV16 E6 and E7 synthetic long peptides for therapeutic applications in HPV16+ tumors. We are continuing to evaluate future opportunities to develop AAC candidates for defined tumor antigens, including KRAS point mutants.
We believe that AACs represent a complementary approach to our APC and eAPC platforms, and that we can strategically select and pursue disease antigens, within and outside of oncology, and clinical development pathways that could enable us to continue to build our portfolio value. We believe that AACs have the potential for broad therapeutic applications across disease types, and we are continuing to progress platform advancements that could enhance product potency, antigen breadth, and other characteristics, while leveraging our manufacturing platform to support product development timelines and costs.
Preclinical Data for SQZ-AAC-HPV in Solid Tumors
 We presented the following key preclinical findings for SQZ-AAC-HPV at the SITC 2020 and 2021 Annual Meetings:
 ●SQZ-AAC-HPV with E7 antigen delayed tumor progression and improved survival in mice, and the antitumor activity was correlated to increases in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. 


Numbers in brackets indicate median survival
 In a TC-1 murine tumor model, we observed meaningful tumor regression in the SQZ-AAC-HPV-E7 Prime + Boost group (n=10) as compared to the control group (n=10), and this effect corresponded with improved median survival of 51 days for the SQZ-AAC-HPV-E7 Prime + Boost regimen versus 36 days for the control. In addition, based on TIL analysis on Day 26 post-treatment, SQZ-AAC-HPV-E7 promoted an influx of CD8+ T cells in tumor tissue, of which over 70% were HPV antigen-specific, and generated an over 100-fold increase in the ratio of E7-specific CD8 + T cells to T regulatory cells as compared to the PBS control, which led to potent, antigen-specific antitumor responses.
●SQZ-AAC-HPV-E7 demonstrated a synergistic therapeutic effect in combination with cisplatin, and induced tumor clearance in all mice treated with the combination regimen. 
 
In TC-1 tumor bearing mice treated with a low dose of cisplatin (5 mg/kg) before SQZ-AAC-HPV-E7 treatment, we observed dramatic tumor clearance in all mice (n=10).
We believe that these preclinical data for SQZ-AAC-HPV support the further study and development of SQZ® AACs as a potential immunotherapy platform for cancer treatment.
Clinical Development of SQZ-AAC-HPV in Solid Tumors
 SQZ-AAC-HPV is being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial, ENVOY-001, for the treatment of HPV16+ recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic solid tumors. The trial is an open-label, multicenter study to determine the safety and

tolerability, immunogenic effects, antitumor activity, and pharmacodynamics of SQZ-AAC-HPV as monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, including ipilimumab and nivolumab.
The primary objectives of the trial are to measure and evaluate: 1) safety and tolerability, as assessed by the number of patients with treatment-related adverse events, and 2) the RP2D for SQZ-AAC-HPV monotherapy and SQZ-AAC-HPV in combination with ipilimumab, nivolumab, and nivolumab plus ipilimumab. The secondary objectives of the trial are to measure and evaluate: 1) the antitumor activity of SQZ-AAC-HPV in patients with recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic solid tumors, and 2) manufacturing feasibility in the monotherapy dose escalation phase of the trial, as measured by the number of potential doses from individual patient blood collection.
We received FDA allowance to proceed with clinical trials of SQZ-AAC-HPV in January 2021 and are targeting initial interim data in the second half of 2022. We intend to evaluate, and potentially implement, a global clinical development strategy for SQZ-AAC-HPV to enable clinical activities both inside and outside of the U.S.



Autoimmune Diseases
 SQZ® Tolerizing Antigen Carrier (TAC) Platform
TAC Platform Overview
 Our SQZ® TAC platform is designed to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance in vivo by utilizing a similar approach to the AAC platform, whereby TACs are derived from engineering RBCs to modulate and suppress unwanted immune responses in a targeted manner.


As with our AAC platform, we utilize proprietary methods and processes for generating TACs, which induce changes associated with RBC senescence, to enable targeting to resident populations of professional APCs, such as macrophages, in lymphoid organs. SQZ® TACs are designed to take advantage of the naturally tolerogenic process of aged RBC clearance and are subsequently aimed to drive antigen-specific immune tolerance through multiple cellular mechanisms considered relevant to the pathology of complex autoimmune diseases. In preclinical studies with transgenic OT-I and OT-II murine models, we evaluated multi-modal mechanisms of tolerance induced by TAC treatment, including upregulation of markers of anergy associated with functional inactivation of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, targeted deletion of antigen-specific T cells, and expansion of antigen-specific regulatory T cells, or Tregs. In January 2021, we presented key data and results from our TAC platform studies at the Antigen-Specific Immune Tolerance, or ASIT, Digital Summit:
   We believe that the potential of TACs to regulate both autoreactive CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells through multiple pathways may enable the development of differentiated therapeutic candidates for the treatment of diverse autoimmune diseases. 
TAC Pipeline for Autoimmune Diseases
In September 2021, we announced the selection of Celiac disease as our lead autoimmune indication for clinical translation. We believe the strong evidence of a causal disease antigen and T-cell driven pathology, and the substantial unmet need for a tolerizing treatment option provide a compelling opportunity for us to pursue Celiac disease. In addition, we believe that our advancement of a TAC product candidate is strengthened by our preclinical work demonstrating multi-mechanism, antigen-specific immune tolerance induction, our point-of-care manufacturing advantages, and our existing RBC product development capabilities.
We believe that our TAC approach has the potential to address some of the current limitations with standard of care treatments for patients with autoimmune diseases, which primarily entail broad immunosuppressive agents. Through

non-specific dampening of immune responses, current immunosuppressive therapies can result in increased risk of opportunistic infection and cancerous malignancies, in addition to organ-specific complications associated with long-term usage.
Celiac Disease Prevalence and Unmet Need
 Celiac disease is a chronic autoimmune disorder that occurs in genetically predisposed people. The disease is triggered by eating foods containing gluten, which is found in wheat, barley, and rye. Disease symptoms can include abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and other common signs. When gluten is ingested, the body mounts an immune response that attacks and damages the villi that line the small intestine, which can impact nutrient absorption. Many people who have Celiac disease have not been diagnosed; however, population-based studies indicate that the disease affects about 2 million people in the United States and approximately 1% of the population worldwide, with regional differences. There is currently no approved drug treatment and patients must therefore maintain a gluten-free diet, which involves strict, lifelong avoidance of exposure to gluten proteins. Long-term complications of Celiac disease may include malnutrition, accelerated osteoporosis, nervous system problems and issues related to reproduction. Rare complications can include cancer of the small intestine, cirrhosis, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
 Preclinical Development of SQZ® TACs
 In June 2021, we presented the following preclinical data for SQZ® TACs in Type 1 diabetes, or T1D, at the 2021 FOCIS Annual Meeting:
 ●TAC treatment prevented T1D onset for all animals and demonstrated durable, disease-altering activity through multiple mechanisms, including deletion of pathogenic CD8+ T cells in the pancreas and reduction of proinflammatory cytokine secretion.
 
In the CD8+ transgenic NY8.3 induced diabetes murine model, TACs were loaded with the NY8.3 cognate epitope (TAC-NRPA7) for therapeutic treatment (n=10). TAC-NRPA7 treatment was able to durably protect mice from the development of T1D, as measured by blood glucose levels with a hyperglycemic threshold of over 250mg/dL. In addition, multiple immune markers corresponded with disease prevention outcomes, including the reduction of pathogenic CD8+ T cells in the pancreas by 60-fold and decreased secretion of proinflammatory cytokine interferon gamma by 375-fold.
●TAC treatment drove bystander suppression, whereby TACs encapsulating a CD4+ antigen alone were able to modulate pathogenic CD8+ T cell subsets with a different autoantigen specificity to enable potential therapeutic benefit. 



In a murine co-adoptive transfer model of T1D with BDC2.5 CD4+ and NY8.3 CD8+ T cells, treatment with TACs loaded with the BDC2.5 cognate epitope (TAC-p31) increased the frequency of BDC2.5 Tregs by 3.5-fold, which were subsequently able to exert bystander suppression of NY8.3 CD8+ T cells. Through bystander tolerogenic activity, TAC-p31 treatment led to a 10-fold reduction in the number of NY8.3 CD8+ T cells and a 9-fold reduction in interferon gamma secretion.
Infectious Diseases
 Our Pipeline for Infectious Diseases
 We believe that our cell therapy platforms aimed at antigen-specific immune activation have therapeutic potential across multiple infectious disease indications. Virus-specific CD8+ T cell activity has been shown to be associated with disease control and improved outcomes in certain diseases, such as chronic HBV, which could be a promising avenue for our directed immunity approach.
In preclinical studies, including those presented at the AACR 2021 Annual Meeting, we have demonstrated the potential of our APC platform to elicit CD8+ T cell responses against HBV (HBsAg), IAV (M1), and CMV (pp65) antigens. We expect that we will continue preclinical activities in chronic HBV with the eAPC platform in 2022, and that we will continue to build upon and apply key platform technologies and concepts, such as mRNA engineering of cells with immune activation signals, to advance our pipeline of infectious disease product candidates.
Collaboration, Research and License Agreements
Roche Collaboration
In October 2018, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement, or the Roche Collaboration Agreement, under which we are collaborating with Hoffman-La Roche Inc. and F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., or together, Roche, in the development and commercialization of certain nucleated cell therapy product candidates that incorporate antigens for the treatment of oncologic indications in accordance with mutually agreed upon collaboration plans. The Roche Collaboration Agreement enhanced, replaced and terminated a 2015 collaboration agreement between us and Roche.
We agreed, under the Roche Collaboration Agreement, to collaborate with Roche in the development of a cell therapy for oncologic indications made from PBMCs. The initial mutually selected antigen target is HPV, which is the focus of our ongoing SQZ-PBMC-HPV Phase 1 clinical trial. We also agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to mutually select additional antigens to develop collaboratively. For each mutually selected antigen (including HPV with respect to SQZ-PBMC-HPV), we are responsible for conducting all preclinical research, and all development activities occurring prior to achieving clinical proof of concept for a product candidate containing the antigen, generally through a Phase 1 clinical trial. With respect to each mutually selected antigen, we granted Roche an option, exercisable after we deliver to Roche a clinical proof-of-concept report for a product candidate containing the antigen, to obtain an exclusive license, under our intellectual property, to research, develop, make, use, import, sell, and otherwise exploit the product candidate worldwide for the treatment of oncologic indications using our SQZ platform and a microfluidic chip. We retain all rights with respect to any product for which Roche does not timely exercise its option, and we may elect to commercialize any such product independently. Following Roche’s exercise of its option for a given product candidate, Roche is then responsible for the further clinical development of that product candidate, unless we exercise our option to exploit the product candidate in the United States, as further described below. Roche granted us an option, exercisable with respect to every alternating mutually selected antigen product for which Roche exercises its own option, beginning with the second, to retain the right under our intellectual property, and to obtain an exclusive license under Roche’s intellectual property, to research, develop, make, use, import, sell and otherwise exploit the antigen product candidate in the United States. If we exercise our option, the parties will mutually determine how responsibility for clinical development will be allocated between them, but Roche has the final say as to which party will run each global clinical study. We own any invention relating solely to a product containing a mutually selected antigen that is developed prior to the exercise of Roche’s option. If Roche exercises its option, Roche owns each subsequently developed invention relating solely to the antigen product candidate unless (a) it is solely related to the SQZ platform or microfluidic chips or is dominated by certain patents that belong to us and are necessary or useful for the practice of our SQZ platform or microfluidic chips, or (b) we exercise our option for the product candidate, in which case we will own such invention in the United States, and Roche will own such invention in all other jurisdictions. The budgeted development costs for these antigens are shared by the parties unless and until (i) Roche exercises its option with respect to a given antigen product candidate, and (ii) we do not exercise our option with respect to that antigen product candidate. In such case, Roche will be responsible for subsequent development costs.
Under the Roche Collaboration Agreement, if we propose an antigen that is not ultimately mutually selected for collaborative development, we may still pursue the development of product candidates containing that antigen. For each such antigen that we select, we may be responsible for conducting all preclinical research, and all development activities occurring prior to achieving a clinical proof of concept for an antigen product candidate containing the antigen. With respect to each such antigen product, Roche grants us an exclusive license under its intellectual property to research, develop, make, use, import, sell, and otherwise exploit the product in the United States. If we achieve a proof of concept for a product candidate containing such antigen, Roche will, for a limited period of time, have the option to obtain an exclusive license under our intellectual property to research, develop, make, use, import, sell, and otherwise exploit the product candidate worldwide (subject to our rights to exploit the product in the United States) for the treatment of oncologic indications using our SQZ platform and a microfluidic chip. We retain all rights with respect to any product candidate for which Roche does not timely exercise its option. Following Roche’s exercise of its option, the parties will mutually determine how responsibility for clinical development will be allocated between them, but Roche has the final say as to which party will run each global clinical study. We own any invention relating solely to a product candidate containing an antigen we select that is developed prior to the exercise of Roche’s option. If Roche exercises its option, we will own in the United States, and Roche will own in

all other jurisdictions, each subsequently developed invention relating solely to the antigen product candidate, unless such invention is solely related to the SQZ platform or microfluidic chips or is dominated by certain patents that belong to us and are necessary or useful for the practice of our SQZ platform or microfluidic chips. We are responsible for all development costs for such antigen, unless and until Roche exercises its option, in which case the development costs subsequently incurred will be shared by the parties.
If Roche proposes an antigen and it is not ultimately mutually selected for collaborative development, Roche may elect to pursue the development of products containing that antigen. At Roche’s cost, we are responsible for conducting all preclinical research, and all development activities occurring prior to achieving a clinical proof of concept for an antigen product candidate containing such antigen. Roche is responsible for all clinical development after a proof of concept is achieved. Roche owns any invention relating solely to antigen product candidates containing such antigen, unless the invention is solely related to the SQZ platform or microfluidic chips or is dominated by certain patents that belong to us and are necessary or useful for the practice of our SQZ platform or microfluidic chips. Roche is responsible for all of the development costs for product candidates containing such antigens.
Under the Roche Collaboration Agreement, preliminary collaboration plans with defined preclinical goals exist for eAPC development and for product candidates containing tumor cell lysate, or TCL. We are responsible for conducting preclinical research and development activities occurring prior to achieving a clinical proof of concept for each such product. With respect to each TCL product candidate, we granted Roche an option, exercisable after we deliver to Roche a clinical proof-of-concept report for such TCL product candidate, to obtain an exclusive license, under our intellectual property, to research, develop, make, use, import, sell, and otherwise exploit the product candidate worldwide for the treatment of oncologic indications using our SQZ platform and a microfluidic chip. We retain all rights with respect to any product candidate for which Roche does not timely exercise its option. Following Roche’s exercise of its option, Roche is then responsible for the further clinical development of each such product candidate. We own any invention relating solely to a TCL product candidate that is developed prior to the exercise of Roche’s option. If Roche exercises its option, each subsequently developed invention relating solely to a TCL product candidate will be owned by Roche, unless it is solely related to the SQZ platform or microfluidic chips or is dominated by certain patents that belong to us and are necessary or useful for the practice of our SQZ platform or microfluidic chips. Prior to the exercise of Roche’s option for a given tumor lysate product candidate, we will share the budgeted Phase 1 clinical costs of developing that product candidate, with Roche responsible for a mid double-digit percentage of the costs and SQZ responsible for the remainder. After Roche exercises its option, we may in some cases elect to opt out of sharing development costs; in such cases, Roche is thereafter responsible for all development costs incurred after exercising its option with respect to a given tumor lysate product candidate. If we do not timely elect to opt out of sharing development costs incurred after Roche’s option exercise, the costs will be shared, with Roche responsible for a mid double-digit percentage and SQZ responsible for the remainder. We will share certain profits and losses associated with the commercialization of TCL product candidates in the United States with Roche, unless we opt out of the cost sharing.
We own any invention developed under the Roche Collaboration Agreement that relates solely to the SQZ platform or microfluidic chips or is dominated by certain patents that belong to us and are necessary or useful for the practice of our SQZ platform or microfluidic chips. Any invention that does not relate solely to an antigen product candidate or TCL product candidate is owned by the party that invents it; if such invention is invented jointly, it is owned jointly by the parties. Each party may freely practice any jointly owned invention with no obligation to account to the other party.
Under the Roche Collaboration Agreement, Roche paid us an upfront payment of $45 million. We are eligible to receive aggregate milestone payments on a product-by-product basis of up to $1.6 billion upon the achievement of specified milestones, consisting of up to $217.0 million of development milestone payments, up to $240.0 million of regulatory milestone payments and up to $1.2 billion of sales milestone payments. Roche has agreed to pay us yearly tiered royalties based on net sales of antigen and TCL product candidates. For each antigen product candidate for which Roche commercializes outside of the United States, and we commercialize in the United States, Roche will pay us tiered royalties on net sales of the product candidate outside of the United States at rates ranging from a mid single-digit percentage to a mid-teens percentage, depending on net sales of the product candidate. For each such product, we will pay Roche tiered royalties on net sales of such product candidate in the United States at rates ranging from a mid single-digit percentage to a mid-teens percentage, depending on net sales of the product candidate in the United States. For antigen product candidates selected by Roche, rather than mutually, Roche will

pay us tiered royalties on worldwide net sales of such product candidate at rates ranging from a mid single-digit percentage to a high single-digit percentage, depending on net sales of the product. For certain antigen product candidates with respect to which Roche commercializes worldwide, Roche will pay us tiered royalties at a rate ranging from a high single-digit percentage to a mid-teens percentage, depending on net sales of the product. No royalties will be due for SQZ antigens for which Roche does not exercise its option. For TCL product candidates, Roche will pay us tiered royalties on the aggregate net sales of all TCL products at rates ranging from either a mid single-digit percentage to a percentage in the low twenties, with the caveat that the rates for sales in the United States may instead range from a low teen percentage to a percentage in the mid twenties, depending on whether and when we opt out of sharing certain profits and costs of commercializing the TCL product candidate in the United States with Roche.
Either party may terminate the Roche Collaboration Agreement (a) in its entirety or on a product-by-product or country-by-country basis if the other party breaches materially and such breach remains uncured for 90 days, or (b) in its entirety for insolvency-related events involving the other party. We may terminate the Roche Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or on a product-by-product or country-by country basis, if Roche or its affiliates or sublicensees commences an action challenging certain patent rights licensed to us and sublicensed to Roche. Roche may terminate the Roche Collaboration Agreement without cause (a) in its entirety or on a product-by-product basis with 60 days’ notice, if Roche is terminating prior to exercising an option under the agreement, (b) on a product-by-product basis with 90 days’ notice, if Roche is terminating after exercising an option under the agreement, (c) on a product-by-product basis or country-by-country basis with 180 days’ notice if Roche is terminating after exercising an option under the agreement, and such notice will become effective on or after the first commercial sale of the product. For any product candidate that is terminated, we may provide a continuation election notice to Roche, and, for consideration, obtain from Roche all reasonably requested rights to such terminated product candidate, including the transfer of ownership of all INDs and regulatory approvals, and copies of data and reports relating to the product candidate, among other things.

We are required to use diligent efforts, or cause our affiliates or sublicensees to use diligent efforts, to develop licensed products, to introduce licensed products and processes into the commercial market and, thereafter, to make licensed products and processes reasonably available to the public. In addition, we are obligated to satisfy certain development and commercialization metrics and provide MIT with periodic progress reports. To date, we have met our diligence obligations under the agreement. For example, our collaboration with Roche and the commencement of our SQZ-PBMC-HPV trial meet clinical milestones under the agreement. After the fifth anniversary, and before the sixth anniversary, of the MIT License Agreement, the parties are obligated to discuss additional diligence obligations to continue the development and commercialization of licensed products and processes.
We are obligated to make certain payments to MIT including an up-front license issue fee, annual maintenance fees, clinical milestone payments, running royalties based on net sales (at a rate in the low single digits), reimbursement of patent costs, and sharing of sublicense income. In June of 2019, we agreed with MIT on a payment schedule for

the sharing of certain amounts received by us from Roche. MIT prosecutes and maintains the patent rights in close consultation with us and our intellectual property counsel. We also provide certain indemnifications for liabilities arising from claims related to the exercise of our rights under the agreement.
Upon entering into the MIT License Agreement, we paid a nominal license issue fee. We agreed to pay MIT a nominal annual license maintenance fee for each calendar year. Each year’s annual license maintenance fee may be credited to running royalties due in the same calendar year. We also agreed to pay MIT milestone payments in an aggregate amount of up to $1.8 million per licensed product or process that achieves certain clinical and regulatory milestones. Additionally, we agreed to pay royalties based on net sales of the licensed products or processes, at low single-digit rates that vary depending on whether sales are made in the therapeutic or research field. With respect to each sublicensee, we are obligated to pay MIT royalties equal to the lesser of (a) a low single-digit percentage of the sublicensee’s net sales and (b) 50% of the running royalties owed to us by the sublicensee. We also agreed to pay MIT a percentage in the mid teens of our annual sublicense income (which does not include income from royalties).
The license will remain in effect until the expiration or abandonment of all issued patents and filed patent applications within the licensed patent rights. The agreement is terminable by us upon six months written notice, provided that we have paid all amounts due to MIT through such termination date, and by MIT for nonpayment of amounts due, our cessation of the business related to the agreement, our uncured material breach of the agreement or a challenge initiated by us of the validity, enforceability or non-infringement of the patents licensed to us under the agreement. In the event of any dispute relating to the agreement, either party may initiate mediation to facilitate a negotiated settlement prior to seeking other legal remedies.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that we believe are commercially important to the development of our business, including by seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in our field.
Our future commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to: (i) obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; (ii) defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular our patents rights; (iii) preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and (iv) operate without infringing, misappropriating or violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our product candidates or any future products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities.
Patents
The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like ours are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. We also cannot ensure that patents will issue with respect to any patent applications that we or our licensors may file in the future, nor can we ensure that any of our owned or licensed patents or future patents will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application may be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our products will be protected or remain protectable by enforceable patents. Moreover, any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.
In the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may, in certain cases, be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to 5 years but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only 1 patent among those eligible for an extension and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it

may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. It is possible that issued U.S. patents covering the use of products from our intellectual property may be entitled to patent term extensions. If our use of product candidates or the product candidate itself receives FDA approval, we intend to apply for patent term extensions, if available, to extend the term of patents that cover the approved use or product candidate. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where available, however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 Our patent portfolio includes more than 35 patent families that we own or have licensed, that have been prosecuted and maintained to potentially secure exclusivity for various SQZ® candidates and platforms through to 2028-2043, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain. As of February 2, 2022, our portfolio is comprised of over 136 U.S. and foreign patents (including over 82 patents in various European countries) and over 305 U.S., Patent Cooperation Treaty (international), and foreign patent applications. These applications are designed to provide protection for various SQZ® product candidates and platforms including the Cell Squeeze® technology and current clinical candidates. In addition, these patents and applications contain a suite of claims directed to the SQZ® systems, devices, composition of matter and methods of use, including methods of inducing an immune response, tolerance, treating cancer, treating various autoimmune diseases, and various other diseases.
We diligently evaluate our intellectual property strategy as we develop new platform technologies and product candidates. We are positioned to file additional patent applications based on our patenting strategy, or where we seek to adapt to competition or seize business opportunities.
The Cell Squeeze® Platform
 As of February 2, 2022, our Cell Squeeze® platform, which includes the Cell Squeeze® technology, methods and use, apparatus and components, and system, is comprised of 66 U.S. and foreign patents and 61 U.S., Patent Cooperation Treaty (international), and foreign patent applications. The patents and applications in this category are relevant or may be relevant to a variety of SQZ® technologies, platforms, and product candidates.
The Immune Activation Platform
 As of February 2, 2022, our immune cell platform, which includes the current SQZ-PBMC-HPV and SQZ-eAPC-HPV clinical candidates as well as confidential candidates and technology, specialized Cell Squeeze® methods and use, as well as clinical formulations and protocols, is comprised of 4 US and foreign patents and 147 U.S., Patent Cooperation Treaty (international), and foreign patent applications.
As of February 2, 2022, our anucleate cell platform, which includes the current SQZ-AAC-HPV clinical candidate as well as confidential candidates and technology, specialized Cell Squeeze® methods and use, as well as clinical formulations and protocols, is comprised of 32 U.S. and foreign patents and 33 U.S., Patent Cooperation Treaty (international), and foreign patent applications.
The Immune Tolerance Platform
 As of February 2, 2022, our autoimmune platform, which includes the current TAC technology as well as confidential candidates and technology, specialized Cell Squeeze® methods and use, is comprised of 26 U.S. and foreign patents and 31 U.S., Patent Cooperation Treaty (international), and foreign patent applications.
Exploratory Work
As of February 2, 2022, our earlier research and exploratory work, which includes confidential early-stage project candidates and specialized Cell Squeeze® methods and use, is comprised of 8 U.S. and foreign patents and 33 U.S., Patent Cooperation Treaty (international), and foreign patent applications.
Trademarks

We currently own 35 allowed or registered trademarks in various jurisdictions worldwide, including four registered trademarks in the United States. We have 12 pending trademark applications worldwide, including 10 in the United States. Our trademark portfolio includes the following pending, allowed, or registered marks registered in the United States and certain other countries: Cell Squeeze, SQZ, SQZ Biotech, Empower Cells to Change Lives, SQZ Therapeutics, SQZ Activating Antigen Carriers, SQZ Antigen Carriers, SQZ Tolerizing Antigen Carriers, SQZ TX, SQZ-AC, SQZ-AAC, and SQZ-TAC.
 Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information
We rely upon unpatented trade secrets, confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with applicable collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants. We also have agreements requiring assignment of inventions with our employees and selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection. These agreements may also be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets and/or confidential know-how may become known or be independently developed by a third party, or misused by any collaborator to whom we disclose such information. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information.
Competition
As a clinical-stage biotechnology company, we face competition from a wide array of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. This competition includes both small companies and large companies with greater financial and technical resources and longer operating histories than our own. We also compete with the intellectual property, technology and product development efforts of academic, governmental and private research institutions.
Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly if they establish collaborative arrangements with large companies.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of any products that we develop, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Our commercial opportunity for any of our product candidates could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours and may commercialize products more quickly than we do.
We expect to compete with companies using other cell engineering approaches, such as electroporation and viral vectors. Companies that are engineering cells with some of these methods include Rubius Therapeutics, which is genetically engineering red blood cells, Fate Therapeutics, which is programing hematopoietic cells and other biotechnology companies working on single cell types.
We expect our lead product candidate, SQZ-PBMC-HPV, will compete with other product candidates for the treatment of HPV+ cancers. While there are currently no FDA-approved therapies that target HPV for HPV+ cancers, there are multiple competing clinical-stage product candidates in development targeting HPV+ cancers. These product candidates include genetically modified T cell therapies in clinical development by Kite, peptide vaccines in clinical development by ISA Pharma, biologics being developed by Cue Biopharma, therapeutics being

developed by Rubius and nucleic acid vaccines in clinical development by BioNTech and clinical development by Inovio. Therapies that are not specific to HPV are also being explored and applied to HPV+ tumors, including tumor infiltrating lymphocytes developed by Iovance Biotherapeutics and immune checkpoint inhibitors that are approved for treatment in multiple solid tumors.
Government Regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biological product candidates such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Biologics Regulation
The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose; 
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs; and 
 •FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States. 
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.

In addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA, supervision of certain human gene transfer trials may also require evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to the public health or the environment, and such assessment may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 •Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. 
 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may also be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

BLA Submission and Review by the FDA
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial user fee to FDA, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
Once a BLA has been submitted, within 60 days, the FDA first reviews the BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the filing date. Priority review designation will direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of applications for products that, if approved, would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious diseases or conditions. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions regarding approval.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response Letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response Letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval or licensure of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the

product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. For a fast track product candidate, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. A fast track-designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA sets the target date for FDA action on the BLA at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would offer a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA accepts the application for filing.

A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers.
In addition, under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA for a product candidate intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the biologic’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval on an expedited basis if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product or if the sponsor fails to conduct such trials in a timely manner
Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.

If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same disease or condition for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug many not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if the second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products.
Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning letters, or untitled letters; 
 •clinical holds on clinical studies; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; 


•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; 
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The Affordable Care Act, or ACA, signed into law in 2010, includes the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or the BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
Our product candidates may require use of an in vitro diagnostic to identify appropriate patient populations. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, companion diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution.

The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA.
If use of companion diagnostic is essential to safe and effective use of a drug or biologic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic contemporaneously with the approval of the therapeutic product. On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance, for novel candidates such as our product candidates, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding drug or biologic candidate should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product labeling. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance document intended to further assist sponsors of therapeutic products and sponsors of in vitro companion diagnostic devices on issues related to co-development of these products.
The FDA generally requires companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain approval of a PMA for that diagnostic contemporaneously with approval of the therapeutic. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of therapeutic candidates such as those we are developing involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and pre-clinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are also subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive pre-clinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. In addition, as part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will issue an order denying approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable order. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not

approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval.
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
Other Healthcare Laws
Pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws may include, without limitation, the U.S. federal anti-kickback , fraud and abuse, false claims, consumer fraud, pricing reporting,, and transparency laws and regulations as well as similar state and foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. Violation of any such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, reputational harm, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of operations and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors.
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors are critical to new product acceptance. The availability of coverage and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors are essential for most patients to be able to afford treatments. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. In the U.S., the Medicare program, which is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, is increasingly used as a model for how commercial and other governmental payors develop their own coverage and reimbursement policies for new drugs and biologics. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product, however, does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufactures to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics.
In addition, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and services. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are more frequently challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical products and biologics, in addition to questioning their safety and

efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the United States Supreme Court dismissed the judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the United States Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 and a 1% reduction from April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, absent additional Congressional action.
There has also been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. In addition, individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to

encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices Further regulatory changes include passage of the Right to Try Act on May 30, 2018. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new medical products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
