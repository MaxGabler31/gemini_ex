See Note 20 - Share Exchange Agreement with BitNile and Gresham to the Company’s financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
 
Reporting Segments
 
Our business has two reporting segments: Microsource and the Giga-tronics Division.
 
Microsource
 
Microsource primarily develops custom microwave products for use in military airborne, sea and ground applications. Microsource’s two largest customers are prime contractors for which we develop and manufacture sophisticated RADAR filters used in fighter aircraft. Revenues from Microsource comprised a majority of our revenues for the fiscal years ended March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021.                           
Giga-tronics Division
 
Our Giga-tronics Division designs, manufactures, and markets a family of functional test products and integrates those test products along with third-party hardware and software to create full test solutions for the RADAR/EW segment of the defense electronics market. Our RADAR/EW test solutions are used to evaluate and improve the performance of RADAR/EW systems. Giga-tronics Division's customers include major United States (“U.S.”) defense prime contractors, the U.S. armed services and research institutes.

Products and Markets
 
Microsource
 
Microsource’s primary business is the production of Yttrium-Iron-Garnet (“YIG”) based microwave components designed specifically for the intended operational application. Microsource produces a line of tunable, synthesized band reject filters for solving interference problems in RADAR/EW applications as well as low noise oscillators used on shipboard and land-based self-protection systems. Microsource designs components based upon the Company’s proprietary YIG technology, for each customer’s unique requirement, generally at the customer’s expense.
 
While our YIG technology may be used in a variety of operational applications and as components in microwave instruments and devices, Microsource’s two largest customers are prime contractors for whom we develop and manufacture RADAR filters used in fighter aircraft. Microsource serves the market for operational hardware associated with the U.S. Government’s RADAR Modernization Program for prior generation fighter aircraft (i.e., the F-15D, F-16, and F/A-18E jets) to extend their useful lives. These RADAR filters are designed to withstand the rigors of operating under extreme conditions. Microsource also delivers YIG hardware for shipboard and land-based close-in weapon systems (“CIWS”) used to defend against missile attacks and other close-in threats.
 
Our customers require that Microsource be certified to the stringent AS9100D aerospace quality standard. Microsource routinely maintains a top-quality rating as measured quarterly by its customers, and over the years has received multiple “Gold Supplier” awards.
 
Microsource handles sensitive information and must maintain a certified cybersecurity program to protect against network intrusion and theft of customer data, as well as loss of its own proprietary information. The Company is working toward a Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC 2.0) Level 2 Certification. In addition, test equipment and systems used in the manufacture of our microwave components must be audited periodically by the U.S. Department of Defense for continued authorization to operate.
 
Microsource’s revenue was $8.3 million for our fiscal year ended March 26, 2022, as we delivered filters for approximately 70 aircrafts. Microsoure revenue fluctuates significantly depending upon when the prime contractors require delivery and place orders. We believe there are approximately 3,000 potential domestic and foreign F-15D, F-16 and F/A-18E aircraft that have not been upgraded. Microsource is a sole-source supplier of filters for these three fighter jets, and we expect that the business will continue to be a significant source of our future revenue.
 
Giga-tronics Division
 
Our Giga-tronics Division designs, manufactures, and markets a family of functional test systems for the RADAR/EW segment of the defense electronics market. Our RADAR/EW test systems are used to evaluate and improve the performance of RADAR systems and EW counter measures, such as jammers. Giga-tronics Division customers include major U.S. defense prime contractors, the armed services (primarily in the U.S.) and research institutes.
 
RADAR and EW systems are subject to extensive test and evaluation before being deployed and often require periodic re-evaluation during their system lifetime. Although field trials (ground, flight, or naval operations) are the most accurate predictor of operational effectiveness, such exercises are too expensive to rely on exclusively for design feedback. Furthermore, defects uncovered during the field trial stage usually results in major program delays and cost overruns. To reduce this risk, the defense industry relies on simulation in a laboratory setting to save development costs and to identify problems early. Nevertheless, field trials remain an essential component in the characterization of defense systems and provide important opportunities from live fire testing of weapon systems to training of personnel in realistic combat scenarios. Our goal is to become a leading supplier of simulation solutions for evaluating defense RADAR and EW systems in both laboratory and field environments.
 
Simulating the electromagnetic environment that modern weapon systems will experience when deployed is a challenging problem. Simulators must generate hundreds, if not thousands, of signals simultaneously to replicate the signal dense environment encountered in a modern battlespace. It is also necessary that many of the signals change dynamically over time to simulate movement. These dynamic signals are injected directly into the system under test (“SUT”) in laboratory settings or transmitted via antennas to the SUT during field trials, such as on an open range, for the purpose of predicting the SUT’s operational performance when placed in service.
 
Traditional Simulation Approaches
 
Generating the many simultaneous signals required for a realistic simulation is traditionally achieved by coordinating the behavior of many separate signal generators and usually results in solutions that are physically large and may cost between $8 million and $20 million depending upon the number of emitters simulated and their waveform complexity. These large systems can take more than a year to specify and procure, are typically installed in fixed locations as they are too large to easily move, and their cost structure almost always leads to a time-shared use model. Moreover, their complexity demands a large degree of support from the manufacturer to initially program scenarios and later reprogram them as requirements change. The dynamics of this type of business model is reminiscent of the IBM mainframe days before personal computers were widely available.
Giga-tronics’ Solution 
 
Giga-tronics has constructed a Threat Emulation System (“TEmS”) using its agile, phase coherent wide bandwidth up-converter hosted within the compact industry standard AXIe modular platform. The instrument-grade upconverter transmits multiple emitters using a low frequency digital waveform generator and results in a simulator much smaller in size and cost compared to traditional solutions. In addition, Giga-tronics’ solution includes emitter software that allows users to define their own scenarios without extensive support from Giga-tronics, including dynamic emitters that simulate movement. Although more limited in overall functionality than the traditionally architected solutions, the small size, relatively easy programming, and a starting price point under half a million dollars, the Giga-tronics TEmS solution greatly increases access to signal simulation capability for test engineers and open range operators in a manner analogous to the way in which the IBM PC increased the availability of computing power to everyone, even though the IBM PC was less powerful than IBM’s namesake mainframes.

We believe our TEmS RADAR/EW simulation solution offers several competitive advantages as follows:
 

1. | It is specifically designed for generating realistic RADAR & EW signals for testing purposes.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | It features digital processing hardware and software for creating a test solution that may be customized with relative ease compared to traditional test systems.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | It is scalable, allowing us to build test systems with multiple channels that scale well both in terms of size and costs compared to traditional systems.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Its small size and low power consumption allow for portable or remote operation.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Its lower price supports continuous availability to engineers on their test benches.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Giga-tronics TEmS solution is already a proven contributor in laboratory environments, such as at prime contractors for product acceptance and at government run installations like the Naval Air Station at Point Mugu California. In addition, the underlying hardware may be attractive to other builders of custom simulation systems.
 
The Giga-tronics TEmS solution is smaller in size, lower in cost, and when coupled with a tracking antenna, operates at lower power levels making it an ideal solution for outdoor installations with multiple locations for simulating integrated air defense systems. We believe that outdoor government test facilities are potentially a significant additional source of revenue because our solutions are portable and can be mounted in trucks for use on military bases and in remote locations. Test engineers are using our equipment to generate realistic RADAR signals for air-crew training and in-flight evaluation of EW system effectiveness. We have delivered portable threat emulation solutions to both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force. This portable application represents a market expansion for our threat emulation solution and we expect it to be a major growth driver in fiscal year 2023.
 
Competition
 
The Company primarily competes in two different markets: Microsource’s YIG components and Giga-tronics RADAR/EW test systems.
 
Microsource is a sole source supplier serving the market for filter components associated with the U.S. Government’s RADAR Modernization Program for certain prior generation fighter jet aircrafts (F-15D, F-16 and F/A-18E jets) and for oscillators in shipboard and land-based missile defense systems. Our Microsource segment supplies RADAR filters specifically designed for military aircraft to solve interference problems created when newer, more powerful RADAR systems are installed on older aircraft without a corresponding upgrade to the onboard self-protection electronics. Only a few other companies possess the technical know-how to design and manufacture YIG components of this nature, such as Teledyne and Micro-Lambda Wireless, but we believe the expense of developing and requalifying new components for the F-15D, F-16 and F/A-18E is prohibitive to the point where an existing prime customer would only undertake such an effort if major issues were to arise, such as significant technical deficiencies or our inability to deliver products on time. No filter is required when an aircraft receives both an upgraded RADAR and an upgraded self-protection package.
 
Microsource has regularly received a gold-supplier rating from its customers, and we believe our sole source position is secure.
 
The Giga-tronics Division serves the defense electronics market with a microwave test platform used in the evaluation of military RADAR/EW systems. This application represents a niche segment within the broader test equipment market. While this niche market segment of RADAR/EW testing is large enough to be meaningful to Giga-tronics, we believe it is too small to attract larger competitors, such as Keysight, Rohde & Schwarz and National Instruments who, to our knowledge, do not approach these markets with new dedicated solutions.
 
We have developed a unique architecture to address the RADAR/EW test requirements that results in systems smaller in size and lower in cost than available solutions. Our competitors often have greater resources in research, development and manufacturing and substantially broader product lines and channels. To compete, we place strong emphasis on maintaining a high degree of technical competence as it relates to the development of new microwave products, we are highly selective in establishing technological objectives and focus our sales and marketing activities in the selected niche areas that are weakly served or underserved by our competitors. Competitors that make alternative equipment to the Giga-tronics Advanced Signal Generator & Analyzer (“ASGA”) system include ELCOM (a division of Frequency Electronics Inc.), VIAVI, and EWST (a division of Ultra Electronics Plc).
 
Northrop Grumman’s CEESIM and Textron System’s A2PATS simulators are two examples of traditionally architected simulation equipment that compete with the Giga-tronics TEmS solution, although their solutions are much larger in size and have a much higher selling price.
 
Fielded Solutions 
 
An example of a traditional fielded simulator is Northrop Grumman’s Joint Threat Emitter (“JTE”). The JTE offers a high-fidelity replica of a potential adversary’s air defense RADAR for training combat pilots and improving air-crew survivability. Each JTE is designed to replicate specific threat radar signals, transmits at high-power levels, and cannot be easily reprogrammed to different threats. At nearly $8.0 million per unit, the JTE is very expensive for simulating a modern integrated air defense system and because it transmits at high power levels, its use is restricted. We believe our TEmS simulator has many advantages to Northrop’s JTE for range applications, including its portability, lower price point and relative ease of user programmability.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Components
 
Substantially all the components required by Giga-tronics to make its assemblies are available from more than one source. We occasionally use sole source arrangements to obtain leading-edge technology or favorable pricing or supply terms, but not in any material volume. In our opinion, the loss of any sole source arrangement we have would not materially affect our operations, though we could experience production delays as we seek new suppliers or re-design components of our products. Some suppliers are also competitors of Giga-tronics. In the event a competitor-supplier chooses not to sell its products to us, production delays that could significantly affect our business could occur as we seek new suppliers or re-design components of our products.
 
Although extended delays in receipt of components from our suppliers could result in longer product delivery schedules for us, we attempt to mitigate this risk by dealing with well-established suppliers and maintaining good relationships with such suppliers.
 
Proprietary Technology and Intellectual Property
 
Our competitive position is largely dependent upon our ability to provide performance specifications for our instruments and systems that (a) effectively and reliably meet customers’ needs and (b) selectively surpass competitors’ specifications in competing products. While patents may provide protection of proprietary designs, with the rapid progress of technological development in our industry, such protection is often short-lived. Therefore, although we occasionally pursue patent coverage, we emphasize the development of new products with superior performance specifications and the upgrading of existing products toward this same end.
 
Our products are primarily based on our own designs, which are derived from our own engineering abilities. If our new product engineering efforts fall behind, our competitive position weakens. Conversely, effective product development greatly enhances our competitive status.
 
We have maintained three non-provisional patents related to our legacy 2500B parametric signal generator product line, which was not among the legacy product lines that have been sold. These patents describe advanced synthesis techniques and can be extended for use with the Giga-tronics ASGA system and to a number of Microsource synthesizer components. In February 2020, the Company was granted a non-provisional U.S. patent relating to its ASGA system. The patent describes the internal design of the Advanced Signal Generator and the Advanced Signal Analyzer along with the architecture of how the components work together to facilitate building multi-channel test systems with reduced size, weight and cost as compared to present solutions. A second non-provisional patent was granted in November 2020 describing uses of the ASGA system in high channel-count situations. A third non-provisional patent application which was filed in April 2020 describing how the ASGA achieves its low noise performance is currently pending before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
 
We are not substantially dependent on trademarks, licenses, or franchises. While we utilize certain software licenses in certain functional aspects for some of our products, such licenses are generally readily available, non-exclusive and are obtained at either no cost or for a relatively small fee.
 
Working Capital Practices
 
We generally strive to maintain adequate levels of inventory and we generally sell to customers on 30-day payment terms in the U.S. and generally allow more time for our international customers. Typically, we receive payment terms of 30 days from our suppliers. We believe that these practices are consistent with typical industry practices. Our primary sources of liquidity come from customer sales and our Amended and Restated Financing Agreement with Western Alliance Bank (“Financing Agreement”), both of which are dependent on our receipt and shipment of customer orders.
 
Dependence on a Limited Number of Customers
 
We are a supplier of RADAR filters for fighter jet aircrafts and RADAR/EW testing solutions to various U.S. government defense agencies, as well as to their prime contractors. We anticipate that revenue from U.S. government agencies and their prime contractors will remain the source of substantially all of our revenue in fiscal 2023. U.S. and international defense-related agencies and their prime contractors accounted for 100% of net revenue in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021.
 
During fiscal 2022, one prime contractor in the Microsource segment accounted for 77% of our consolidated revenues and a second prime contractor in the Microsource segment accounted for 10% of our consolidated revenues.
 
During fiscal 2021, two prime contractors in the Microsource segment accounted for 66% of our consolidated revenues. A third customer accounted for 14% of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2021 and was included in the Giga-tronics Division reporting segment.
 
Our business is therefore dependent on a limited number of customers. We could experience a material adverse effect on our financial stability if we were to lose one or more of our U.S. defense customers.
 
Both Microsource and our Giga-tronics Division businesses are largely dependent on U.S. defense spending and budgets and are subject to expansion and contraction across fiscal year periods. Revenues from orders for Microsource products and services often span several years with deliveries varying across both interim and annual fiscal year periods. Additionally, the Giga-tronics Division’s RADAR/EW testing system is a relatively new product platform with fewer targeted customers and significantly longer sales cycles and greater average selling prices compared to our prior general-purpose test and measurement equipment product lines. We therefore expect that a major customer in one year may not be a major customer in the following year. Accordingly, our net revenue and earnings may vary significantly from one period to the next and will decline if we are unable to gain new customers or cannot increase our business with other existing customers to replace declining net revenue from the previous year’s major customers.

Backlog of Orders
 
On March 26, 2022, our backlog of unfilled orders was approximately $1.4 million compared to approximately $5.1 million on March 27, 2021. Orders for our products include program orders from prime contractors with extended delivery dates. Accordingly, the backlog of orders may vary substantially from year to year and the backlog entering any single fiscal quarter may not be indicative of revenue for any period. In addition, the Company recognizes revenue for certain contracts as it incurs costs, as opposed to when units are delivered and, as a result, our backlog is reduced when such revenue recognition occurs.
 
Backlog includes only those customer orders for which a binding agreement exists, a delivery schedule has been agreed upon between us and our customer and, in the case of U.S. government orders, for which funding has been appropriated.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Microsource and the Giga-tronics Division sell their products primarily direct to U.S. defense agencies and their prime defense contractors. The Company primarily relies on its internal sales teams to identify leads and complete sales. It also engages independent sales representatives who are perceived to have expertise with targeted markets and/or customers.
Product Development
 
Products manufactured by Giga-tronics historically have had relatively long product life cycles. However, the electronics industry is subject to rapid technological changes at the component level. Our future success is dependent on our ability to steadily incorporate new functionality and advancements in component technologies into our new products. In fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, product development expenses totaled approximately $1.2 million and $2.2 million, respectively.
 
Our Microsource division’s products are designed for each customer’s unique requirements, generally at the customer’s expense.
 
Our Giga-tronics Division product development activities have historically been funded internally, through product line sales, or through outside equity investment and debt financing. Product development activities are primarily expensed as incurred except for capitalization of labor cost of $172,500 for internally developed software.
 
We expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development, the majority of which is focused within the Giga-tronics Division, though we expect some continuing investment in Microsource in order to develop concepts that lead to future customer funded projects and ultimately quantity production. There can be no assurance that future technologies, processes, or product developments will not render our current product offerings obsolete or that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to existing products that satisfy customer needs in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance. Failure to do so could adversely affect our business.
 
Manufacturing
 
The Company assembles and tests Microsource and Giga-tronics Division products at its Dublin, California headquarters facility. Microsource develops and manufactures RADAR filters used in fighter jet aircrafts and low noise oscillators used in CIWS. Our Giga-tronics Division manufactures a family of functional test products and integrates those test products along with third-party hardware and software to create full test solutions for the RADAR/EW segment of the defense electronics market.
Environment
 
To the best of our knowledge, we are in compliance with all federal, state and local laws and regulations involving the protection of the environment.
 
Employees
 
As of March 26, 2022 and March 27, 2021, we employed 45 and 42 individuals on a full-time basis respectively. We believe that our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel. Competition for skilled personnel in our markets is competitive. While our size and capital resources constrain our ability to attract and retain employees with cash compensation, we attempt to compensate for this constraint by offering equity awards and opportunities for training and internal promotion. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
Information about Foreign Operations
 
We have very limited revenues internationally. We sell to our international customers through a network of foreign technical sales representative organizations. All transactions with our international customers are in U.S. dollars.
