ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
 
We began operations in 1988, under the ownership and control of Ardell Mees, who provided installation services to grocery decor design companies. As our reputation for excellent workmanship has grown, we have expanded our operations to serve a larger geographic region. On January 4, 2001, we incorporated in North Dakota as ADM Enterprises, Inc. On May 9, 2006, the Company changed both its name to ADM Endeavors, Inc. (“ADM Endeavors,” or the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and its domicile to the state of Nevada. On July 1, 2008, the Company acquired all of the assets of ADM Enterprises, LLC (“ADM Enterprises”), a sole proprietorship owned by Ardell and Tammera Mees, in exchange for 10,000,000 newly issued shares of our common stock. As a result, ADM Enterprises became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company. Even though the Company was incorporated on January 4, 2001, it had no operations until the share exchange agreement with ADM Enterprises on July 1, 2008. All business operations are those solely of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, ADM Enterprises.
 
In May 2013, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to provide for an increase in its authorized share capital. The authorized common stock increased to 800,000,000 shares at a par value of $0.001 per share and preferred stock increased to 80,000,000 shares at a par value of $0.001 per share.
 
Current Business Operations
 
We provide customized construction and installation of grocery store decor for both new and renovated grocery stores. Our service and expertise include the installation of grocery checkout stands, grid ceilings, cart-stops, shelving, customer service counter, office cabinetry and other grocery store equipment and fixtures. Our clients primarily consist of design companies, most of whom are subsidiaries of major retail grocery chains, or are affiliated with Associated Wholesale Grocers, the nation’s second largest retailer-owned grocery wholesaler. We believe that our success is the result of both our quality installation of grocery equipment and fixtures, and high level of personal service that we provide to our customers. We receive bid requests from all regions of the United States. Therefore, we are seeking to expand our operations to service additional geographic areas.
The majority of our contracts have been in the Midwestern United States including North Dakota, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. Over the past 25 years, ADM Endeavors has completed projects in 25 states, including North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Wyoming, Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Illinois, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Arkansas, Missouri, Texas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, California, Nevada, and Florida.
 
The main focus of our expansion plan includes primarily the Midwestern United States including the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Wyoming, Nebraska, and Kansas, as well as some southern states such as Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi.
 
To effectuate our business plan during the next twelve months, we must increase our current customer base, as well as acquire additional employees and equipment so that we may accommodate our expanded customer base. We anticipate that we will establish an online presence to increase our market visibility and corporate recognition. We believe we can establish our industry presence and stimulate interest by constructing a trade show booth to market our services when we attend annual grocer tradeshows and conventions.
 
Use of Grocery Decor Installation Services in the Construction and Remodeling Industry has grown tremendously in recent years. The retail grocery industry is highly competitive and requires constant innovations to attract and retain customers. Accordingly, neighborhood markets battle for patrons by catering to customers’ desires for a modern, clean, and convenient shopping experience. Grocery stores, therefore, typically renovate every five to six years to maintain a new image.
 
In the past, store workers, painters or carpenters installed decor items. However, as the designs and materials became increasingly elaborate, the need for specialized and experienced installers grew. The installation process requires that an installer have special knowledge of various aspects of construction, including framing, finishing, and remodeling. Additionally, knowledge of standards for product usage, hanging methods and quality control are extremely helpful. As a result of the frequency of store renovations, coupled with the complexity of the items being installed secures the demand for custom installation services.

Competition
 
We believe that the installation business competes on price, reputation for quality, timeliness, familiarity with retail construction, the availability of aggregate materials and financial strength. We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of the foregoing factors. The market for construction services, particularly services to national retail chains, is highly competitive. Several of our competitors are larger, better known and have substantially greater marketing, financial, personnel and other resources, including established reputations and working relationships, than we do. We cannot guaranty that our services will continue to be competitive in the market place. Our primary competitor in our respective market area of the Midwest is PFI, Inc., based in Denver, Colorado.
 
ADM ‘s chief competitors are located primarily in larger cities. The following identifies those with whom ADM competes on a regular basis and their applicable market share:
 

Competitor | Location | Market Share 
------------------------+---------------------+-----------------
PFP | Kansas City, MO | 20% 
A.N. Decor | Minneapolis, MN | 20% 
PFI, Inc. | Denver, CO | 60% 
Twin Store Fixtures | Chicago, Ill | 40% 
Jamison Sign Co. | Spokane, WA | 30% 

 
These particular locations are representative of the markets in which ADM already does a small percentage of business. Because of past success in these markets, it is ADM’s belief that establishing a full-time presence will build revenues very quickly.
 
ADM’s reputation in the industry will be the basis for expanding into these new markets. Word of mouth and designer referrals has led to the company’s success up to the present time. Consequently, ADM staff will contact any and all designers in these designated markets to obtain referrals and will send introductory letters upon entering the market.
 
Some of the targeted markets for expansion currently are showing enough demand for services that the full-time presence is already justified and those locations would grow even more quickly. Those select locations are scheduled first for expansion.


Compliance with Government Regulation
 
We believe that we are and will continue to be in compliance in all material respects with applicable statutes and the regulations passed in the United States. There are no current orders or directions relating to our company with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations.
Environmental Regulations
 
We do not believe that we are or will become subject to any environmental laws or regulations of the United States. While our products and business activities do not currently violate any laws, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our products or potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Bankruptcy or Similar Proceedings
 
There has been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding pertaining to the Company.
 
Reorganizations, Purchase or Sale of Assets
 
There have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, purchases or sales of a significant amount of assets not done in the ordinary course of business pertaining to the Company.
Patents, Trademarks, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements, or Labor Contracts
 
The Company claims no ownership of any patent or trademark, nor is it bound by any outstanding royalty agreements related thereto.
