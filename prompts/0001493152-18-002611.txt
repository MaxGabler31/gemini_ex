ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview 
 
We are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing next generation vaccines to address unmet needs in infectious disease and immuno-oncology. Our first marketed product is Sci-B-Vac™ a third-generation hepatitis B virus (“HBV”) vaccine that contains all three viral surface antigens of the hepatitis B virus. Sci-B-Vac is approved for use in Israel and 14 other countries. In December 2017, we initiated a global Phase III program for Sci-B-Vac designed to achieve licensure for the vaccine in the United States (“U.S.”), Europe and Canada. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, SciVac Ltd., manufactures Sci-B-Vac in Rehovot, Israel.
 
We are also advancing our “enveloped” virus-like particle (“eVLP”) platform technology. Our eVLP platform technology enables the development of enveloped virus-like particle vaccines that closely mimic the target virus to elicit a potent immune response. We are advancing a pipeline of eVLP vaccines, with lead programs in both infectious disease, with our congenital cytomegalovirus (“CMV”) vaccine candidate, and in immuno-oncology, with our therapeutic glioblastoma multiforme (“GBM”) vaccine candidate.
 
Recent Developments
 
Sci-B-Vac
 
Sci-B-Vac has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) or Health Canada. On December 19, 2017, we announced the commencement of patient dosing in the Phase III clinical program for Sci-B-Vac following discussions with the FDA, the EMA, and Health Canada. The Phase III program will be a global program, with approximately 40 sites across the U.S., Europe and Canada, consisting of two concurrent Phase III studies - a safety and immunogenicity study (“PROTECT”) and a lot-to-lot consistency study (“CONSTANT”), enrolling approximately 4,800 subjects. See “—Principal Products—Sci-B-Vac.” Headline data is expected mid-year 2019.
 
The study continues to enroll participants in both the U.S. and Canada. Clinical trial applications were filed in the United Kingdom, Finland, Germany and Belgium. So far, the applications were approved in the United Kingdom, Finland and in Germany.
 
A post-marketing Phase IV clinical study of Sci-V-Bac in Israel was completed in June 2017, and we are nearing the completion of the clinical study report.

Congenital CMV Vaccine Candidate (eVLP)
 
Patient enrollment was initiated in June 2016 in a Phase I clinical study for our congenital CMV vaccine candidate, VBI-1501, which is our second lead program. In July 2017, we announced interim data from the Phase I clinical study of safety data through day 84 of the study and initial immunogenicity signals in participant samples collected one month after the second of three planned vaccine doses; our congenital CMV vaccine candidate was well tolerated at all doses and demonstrated induced antibody responses against the CMV glycoprotein B (gB) antigen with clear evidence of dose-dependent boosting after the second vaccination. The final data read-out of safety and immunogenicity, following a third vaccination, is expected in the first half of 2018.
 
Therapeutic GBM Vaccine Candidate (eVLP)
 
On August 11, 2017, the FDA accepted an IND for a therapeutic GBM brain cancer vaccine candidate, VBI-1901, to initiate a multi-center Phase I/IIa clinical study evaluating VBI-1901 in patients with recurrent GBM. The first patient in the study received the first dose in January 2018. We expect immunologic data from ongoing biomarker analyses by mid-year 2018, and initial correlations between biomarker analyses and clinical outcomes in the second half of 2018.
 
On October 3, 2017, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted a patent on VBI-1901.
 
Preclinical Research
 
In October 2017, we disclosed new data on a Zika vaccine candidate, VBI-2501 which was developed with the eVLP platform. The vaccine candidate contains a proprietary modified version of glycoprotein E and NS1 of Zika in a bivalent construct. Preclinical data in mice demonstrated that the bivalent construct produced a surprisingly superior neutralization of Zika, relative to monovalent versions. We believe that such data further supports the flexibility of eVLP platform.
 
Additionally, we have recently completed research collaborations with both Sanofi Vaccine Techonologies S.A.S, (“Sanofi”) and Glaxo Smith Kline Biologicals SA (“GSK”) to stabilize other vaccine candidates. No further work on these collaboration candidates is anticipated at this time.
 
Financing Activities
 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we raised an aggregate of $71.9 million in equity financing to support our vaccine development programs, to continue the advancement of our research programs and for other general corporate purposes, including an underwritten public offering and a concurrent registered direct offering of an aggregate of 23,575,410 common shares at a price of $3.05 per share, which closed on October 30, 2017. In connection with the registered direct offering, we issued four-year warrants to purchase 550,000 common shares at an exercise price of $3.34 per share. Since inception, we have collectively raised approximately $196.6 million in total equity and debt financing for those purposes.

Corporate History
 
We were incorporated under the laws of British Columbia by Memorandum of Association on April 9, 1965 under the name “Alice Arm Molybendum Co. Ltd.” On October 21, 1965, we changed our name to “Alice Arm Mining Ltd.” and subsequently, on July 13, 1975, changed our name to “New Congress Resources Ltd.” On January 12, 1983, we changed our name to “Levon Resources Ltd.”
 
On July 9, 2015, we, then known as Levon Resources Ltd. (“Levon”), completed a plan of arrangement (the “Levon Merger”) pursuant to which SciVac Ltd. (“SciVac”), an Israel based company, completed a reverse takeover of Levon. Levon changed its name from Levon Resources Ltd. to SciVac Therapeutics Inc. and SciVac became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Other than approximately CAD $27 million in cash retained by us, all of our other assets and liabilities were transferred or assumed by 1027949 BC Ltd., our then wholly-owned subsidiary (“BC Ltd.”). Upon consummation of the Levon Merger, each of our shareholders received 0.5 of a common share of BC Ltd., resulting in our shareholders holding 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of BC Ltd; therefore, we no longer own any equity interest in BC Ltd.
 
On July 14, 2015, our common shares commenced trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) under the symbol “VAC” and our common shares also began to be quoted on the OTCQX marketplace (the “OTCQX”) maintained by the OTC Markets Group Inc. under the symbol “SVACF.”
 
On May 6, 2016, we completed our acquisition of VBI Vaccines (Delaware) Inc. (“VBI DE”), pursuant to which Seniccav Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary, merged with and into VBI DE, with VBI DE continuing as the surviving corporation and as our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “VBI-SciVac Merger”). Upon completion of the VBI-SciVac Merger, we (then named “SciVac Therapeutics Inc.”) changed our name to “VBI Vaccines Inc.” and received approval for the listing of our common shares on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Our common shares commenced trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market at the opening of trading on May 9, 2016 under our new name and the symbol “VBIV.” Following the effective time of the VBI-SciVac Merger, our common shares began to trade on the TSX under the new symbol “VBV.”
 
Our registered office is located at Suite 1700, Park Place, 666 Burrard Street, Vancouver British Columbia V6C 2X8. Our principal executive offices are located at 222 Third St. Suite 2241, Cambridge, MA 02142. Our manufacturing operations are located at 13 Gad Feinstein Road, POB 580, Rehovot, Israel 7610303 and our research operations are located at 310 Hunt Club Road East, Suite 201, Ottawa, Ontario Canada K1V 1C1.
 
Background of VBI DE
 
VBI DE was originally established in 1970 as Paulson Capital Corp., an Oregon corporation (“Paulson Oregon”), which began as a holding company whose operating subsidiary, Paulson Investment Company, Inc. (“PIC”), was a full service brokerage firm. Effective March 20, 2014, Paulson Oregon changed its state of incorporation from the State of Oregon to the State of Delaware (the “Reincorporation”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 20, 2014 by and between Paulson Oregon, and Paulson Oregon’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Paulson Capital (Delaware) Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Paulson Delaware”). As a result of the Reincorporation, Paulson Oregon became Paulson Delaware, its name became “Paulson Capital (Delaware) Corp.” and Paulson Oregon ceased to exist. Paulson Oregon’s shareholders approved the Reincorporation pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger at Paulson Oregon’s 2013 annual meeting of shareholders held on November 8, 2013.
 
On July 25, 2014, Variation Biotechnologies (US), Inc. (“VBI US”) completed its merger (the “PLCC Merger”) with VBI Acquisition Corp. (“Merger Sub”), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of VBI DE, whereby Merger Sub merged with and into VBI US, with VBI US continuing as the surviving corporation. As a result of the PLCC Merger, VBI US was acquired by, and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of VBI DE and VBI DE changed its name to VBI Vaccines Inc. and then subsequently changed its name to VBI Vaccines (Delaware) Inc. on July 19, 2016.
 
The PLCC Merger was consummated pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated May 8, 2014 (the “PLCC Merger Agreement”), by and among VBI US, VBI DE and Merger Sub. The PLCC Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were approved by VBI DE’s board of directors on May 1, 2014 and by VBI DE’s stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders held on July 14, 2014.
 
At the effective time of the VBI-SciVac Merger, the stockholders of VBI DE received our common shares which, together with options to purchase shares of VBI DE common stock that were converted into options to purchase our common shares represented approximately 46.2% of our common shares on a fully diluted basis after the VBI-SciVac Merger.

We are to pay Ferring the above-mentioned royalties on a country-by-country basis until the date which is ten (10) years after the date of commencement of the first royalty year in respect of such country (the “License Period”). Upon expiry of the full term of the first License Period having commenced, we have the option to extend the Ferring License Agreement in respect of all the countries that still make up the Territory (as defined in the Ferring License Agreement) (as from the respective date of expiry) for an additional seven (7) years by payment to Ferring of a one-time lump sum payment of $100. Royalties will continue to be payable for the duration of the extended License Periods. When the license has been in effect for, and elapsed after, a seventeen (17) year License Period with respect to a country in the Territory, we will thereafter have a royalty-free license to market (as defined in the Ferring License Agreement) in such country and when all the License Periods have expired in each country in the Territory.
 
SciGen Singapore Assignment Agreement 
 
Under an assignment and assumption agreement, we are required to pay royalties to SciGen Ltd. (“SciGen Singapore”) equal to 5% of Net Sales of Sci-B-Vac product sales (as defined in such agreement). Royalty payments of $25, $4 and $15 were recorded in cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
eVLP Technology
 
We are engaged in the inbound licensing of key intellectual property (“IP”). We identified the need for a vaccine antigen discovery and design platform and, as indicated in the discussion titled “Subsidiaries”, through that certain sale and purchase agreement entered into on July 18, 2011 (the “Sale and Purchase Agreement”) among VBI Cda and ePixis SA (“ePixis”) and the shareholders of ePixis (collectively, the “Sellers”), acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of ePixis in order to obtain access to its exclusive rights to key IP covering its “enveloped Virus Like Particle” or “eVLP” vaccine platform (the “Technology”), including patents (the “Acquired Patents”) covering the Technology. We paid a purchase price of €400 (approximately $450) for the ePixis shares and approximately $75 in related transaction costs. VBI Cda also agreed to make certain contingent payments to the Sellers as follows:
 

● | Upon the completion of a “Successful Technology Transfer”, as defined in the Sale and Purchase Agreement, to a contract manufacturing organization, we paid €101 to the Sellers during the year ended December 31, 2015. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Upon the earlier to occur of (i) first approval by the FDA of a new drug application (an “NDA”) permitting us or any sublicensee to market and sell any pharmaceutical product or candidate pharmaceutical product that contains or can express an eVLP (a “eVLP Product”) in the U.S. or (ii) first approval by the EMA of a Marketing Authorization Application or equivalent submission permitting us or our sublicensees to market and sell a eVLP Product candidate in one or more countries in the EU, we must pay to the Sellers €1,000, or, if there are no longer any issued and valid claims of the Acquired Patents in effect at the date such event occurs, €500. 

 
If a eVLP Product is commercialized, we will be required to pay the Sellers the following:
 

● | On the date that Cumulative Net Sales (as defined in the Sale and Purchase Agreement), of all eVLP Products equals or exceeds €25,000, we must pay to the Sellers €1,500, or, if there are no longer any issued and valid claims of the Acquired Patents in effect at the date such event occurs, €750; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | On the Date that Cumulative Net Sales of all eVLP Products equals or exceeds €50,000 in the aggregate, we must pay to the Sellers €2,000 or, if there are no longer any issued and valid claims of the Acquired Patents in effect at the date such event occurs, €1,000.

Included in the eVLP Acquired Patents were patents (the “UPMC Patents”) co-owned by L’Universite Pierre et Marie Curie (“UPMC”), and the Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (“INSERM”), both in Paris, France. In July 2006, ePixis entered into a license agreement (the “ePixis License Agreement”) with UPMC, INSERM and L’école Normale Supérieure de Lyon (collectively the “Licensor”) pursuant to which the Licensor granted to ePixis an exclusive license (with the right to sublicense with written consent from UPMC) to exploit the UPMC Patents for the purpose of developing, promoting and marketing products within the U.S., Japan, Canada, and Europe until the invalidation of the last of the UPMC Patents, including any supplementary protection certificates. Pursuant to the ePixis License Agreement, ePixis was to pay certain fees to the Licensor based on net sales (as defined in the ePixis License Agreement) of products developed from the UPMC Patents, sublicensing income based on net sales (“Sublicensing Payments”) and one-time payments (“Lump Sum Payments”) for each product developed from the UPMC Patents. ePixis also agreed to reimburse UPMC for fees and costs related to filing and maintaining the patent applications.
 
On July 12, 2011, the parties to the ePixis License Agreement entered into the first amendment to the ePixis License Agreement (the “ePixis Amendment”). The ePixis Amendment authorized the transfer of the ePixis License Agreement to us and laid out new financial terms and conditions for the rights granted under the ePixis License Agreement.
 
The ePixis Amendment provides that the fees to be paid to the Licensor by ePixis on net sales of eVLP Products based on the UPMC Patents will be 1.75% of net sales for annual sales between €0 and €50,000, 1% of net sales for annual sales between €50,000 and €100,000, and 0.75% of net sales for annual sales in excess of €100,000. Pursuant to the ePixis Amendment, Lump Sum Payments would be made as follows:
 

● | €50 when the results from pre-clinical studies are sufficient to allow a product to enter a regulatory filing similar to an IND or a similar entity in a country other than the U.S.; this milestone was met and paid during the year ended December 31, 2016 for the CMV candidate and an additional €50 was accrued during the year ended December 31, 2017 for the GBM candidate; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | €150 when the results from pre-clinical studies are sufficient to allow a product into a clinical phase, including Phase I-II clinical studies; this milestone was met and paid during the year ended December 31, 2016 for the CMV candidate and an amount of €150 is due upon initiation of a Phase I clinical trial for the GBM candidate in 2018; 
● | €250 when a product enters Phase II clinical studies, an event that is defined by the enrollment of the first patient; 
● | €500 when a product enters Phase III clinical studies; and 
● | €1,000 when a product is first marketed.

Sublicensing Payments under the ePixis Amendment were revised as follows: 25% of any amounts received by ePixis for the sublicense if the sublicense is entered into prior to the start of Phase I clinical studies; 10% of any amounts received by ePixis if the sublicense is entered into during Phase I clinical studies and prior to the start of Phase II clinical studies; 7% of any amounts received by ePixis if the sublicense is entered into during Phase II clinical studies and prior to the start of Phase III clinical studies, and 5% of any amounts received by ePixis if the sublicense is entered into after the start of Phase III clinical studies. There was no change to the requirement that ePixis reimburse UPMC for fees and costs related to filing and maintaining the patent applications.
 
The parties may terminate the ePixis License Agreement, as amended, by mutual agreement. There is also a cancellation right that may be exercised in the event of breach. UPMC may terminate the ePixis License Agreement if we, among other things, declare bankruptcy; do not put forth reasonable effort or are unable to develop and market the products, and, in particular, if we suspend the development of the products for more than six months; our inability to make the payments required by the ePixis License Agreement; lack of sales of a product, or lack of a signed sub-license agreement within one year from the date of acquiring AMM (Autorisation de mise sur le marché - Regulation of Therapeutic Goods) authorization, or the necessary equivalent authorization for the use of the products; and lack of sales of a product for more than two years after the initial marketing has taken place. During the year-ended December 31, 2016, VBI Cda paid UPMC €200, in milestone payments related to CMV Phase I clinical trial approval and start. There were no payments made to UPMC during the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2015.
 
Kevelt AS
 
Prior to the Levon Merger, one of the directors of SciVac was also the chairman of the board of Kevelt AS (“Kevelt”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of OAO Pharmsynthez (“Pharmsynthez”), and was also the chairman of the board of Pharmsynthez. Following the Levon Merger, in accordance with the merger agreement, this director resigned. On April 26, 2013, prior to the Levon Merger, SciVac entered into a Development and Manufacturing Agreement (“DMA”) with Kevelt, pursuant to which SciVac agreed to develop the manufacturing process for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of certain materials in drug substance form for an aggregate amount of $4.3 million. The original term of the DMA was for a period of one year commencing April 26, 2013, but pursuant to the terms of the DMA, the term automatically renewed thereafter for successive additional one-year periods, unless the parties failed to agree on the terms applicable to any renewal term and either party provided at least 30 days prior written notice of non-renewal to the other. On November 8, 2017, SciVac entered into a settlement agreement with Kevelt, pursuant to which SciVac paid Kevelt $1 million in cash on November 9, 2017, and issued 274,000 common shares of VBI Vaccines Inc. with a value of $1,142 on December 18, 2017. As part of the settlement, the DMA was terminated and each of SciVac and Kevelt released the other from all claims and liabilities arising under the DMA.
 
Principal Products
 
Our principal products include our Sci-B-Vac vaccine, CMV vaccine candidate, GBM vaccines candidate and eVLP Platform.
 
Sci-B-Vac Vaccine 
 
Our Sci-B-Vac product is a third generation hepatitis B virus vaccine for adults, children and newborns, approved for use in Israel and 14 other countries. Sci-B-Vac has not yet been approved by the FDA, Health Canada or the EMA. The Sci-B-Vac vaccine has demonstrated safety and efficacy in nearly 500,000 patients in currently licensed markets. Several clinical trials have shown more rapid and high rates of seroprotection with Sci-B-Vac.
 
A Phase IV post-marketing clinical study for Sci-B-Vac in Israel was completed in June 2017 and we are nearing the completion of the clinical study report. The purpose of this study was to confirm a new in-house reference standard for regulatory and quality control purposes. Additionally, we are currently enrolling participants in the Phase III clinical program with the goal of obtaining FDA, EMA, and Health Canada market approvals for commercial sale of Sci-B-Vac in the U.S., the Europe, and Canada, respectively. We estimate that the need for a next-generation hepatitis B vaccine represents an annual global market opportunity of approximately $600 million - $800 million.
 
Sci-B-Vac is a “third generation” hepatitis B virus vaccine, distinguished from previous generations in that Sci-B-Vac (i) is produced in mammalian cells (CHO cells) and (ii) contains all three surface antigens, naturally occurring on the outer surface of the hepatitis B virus – preS1, preS2, and the S proteins. The composition of Sci-B-Vac therefore provides more opportunities for the immune system to respond with antibodies, or neutralizing antibodies, which can recognize one of these components of the hepatitis B particle. Because the Sci-B-Vac active component displays proteins substantially similar to those found on the outer surface of the naturally occurring hepatitis B virus, we believe that Sci-B-Vac could be highly potent and immunogenic (capable of conferring immunity) and provide patients with an alternative to existing yeast-derived hepatitis B virus vaccines. We also believe that Sci-B-Vac fills a significant gap in an unmet medical need to protect against hepatitis B virus, especially in older individuals who may not be adequately protected with currently licensed hepatitis B vaccines: seroconversion rates with currently licensed hepatitis B vaccines fall dramatically within the elderly and high-risk patient populations due to the immuno-senescence or immuno-compromising conditions of such patients.
 
Several clinical studies conducted by us have demonstrated that Sci-B-Vac possesses the following benefits relating to the prevention of the hepatitis B virus:
 

● | Sci-B-Vac has been demonstrated to be highly immunogenic in adults, children and newborn infants; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Several clinical trials have shown rapid and high rates of seroprotection with Sci-B-Vac in a larg percentage of vaccinated individuals. In addition, seroprotection (the attainment of immunologically protective levels of anti-hepatitis B virus antibodies) was induced with only 25-50% of the recommended dose for currently U.S.- licensed hepatitis B virus vaccines; and 
● | Sci-B-Vac generated an adequate immune memory for long-term protection against hepatitis B.

Sci-B-Vac is generally well-tolerated by patients; during the clinical development and trials of Sci-B-Vac less than half of the patients experienced local reactions at the injection site (as commonly observed with the use of most vaccines). The injection site reactions included soreness, pain, tenderness, pruritus, which is itchiness, erythema, which is redness, ecchymosis, which is discoloration of the skin resulting from bleeding underneath the skin, swelling, warmth and nodule formation. These reactions were generally mild and were resolved within two days after vaccination. Additionally, fatigue, weakness, headache, fever, malaise, nausea, diarrhea, pharyngitis, which is inflammation of the pharynx, and upper respiratory infection were observed.
 
Phase III Clinical Studies
 
On February 7, 2017, we announced that we received positive scientific advice from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the EMA regarding our development path for our Sci-B-Vac vaccine in Europe. In its letter, the CHMP expressed its support of our proposed plan to proceed to the Phase III clinical studies of Sci-B-Vac The CHMP also agreed that the product information, as well as data from ongoing studies, supports the Phase III clinical studies and our planned filing of a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) for Sci-B-Vac.
 
On February 22, 2017, we announced that the Biologics and Genetic Therapies Directorate (“BGTD”) of Health Canada expressed its general support and acceptance of our development path for our Sci-B-Vac vaccine in a pre-Clinical Trial Application (“CTA”) meeting. Considering the manufacturing data, licensed clinical efficacy and safety experience of Sci-B-Vac, the BGTD agreed in principle with our overall development strategy. In addition, the BGTD agreed that the proposed Phase III program would satisfy the regulatory requirements, for marketing authorization in Canada, supporting the indication for active immunization against hepatitis B in adults. On June 14, 2017, Health Canada provided us with a No Objection Letter for both PROTECT and CONSTANT studies, which authorized us to proceed with the Sci-B-Vac Phase III clinical studies as described in our CTA.
 
On August 25, 2017, the FDA accepted our IND for the Sci-B-Vac Phase III clinical program. Acceptance of the IND enabled us to initiate the Sci-B-Vac Phase III clinical program in the U.S. Based on the clinical data collected to date, and the discussions held with the FDA, EMA and Health Canada, we initiated enrollment in the Phase III clinical program of Sci-B-Vac for prevention of the hepatitis B virus in December 2017 and commenced patient dosing.
 
The Phase III program consists of two concurrent studies:
 
ABOUT PROTECT – Safety and Immunogenicity Study
 
PROTECT will be a double-blind, two-arm, randomized, controlled study. Approximately 1,600 adult subjects, age 18 years and older, are expected to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a three-dose course of Sci-B-Vac 10mcg or a three-dose course of the control vaccines, Engerix-B® 20mcg. Enrollment will be stratified by age group.
 
The co-primary objectives of the study will be:
 

● | To demonstrate non-inferiority of the seroprotection rate induced by Sci-B-Vac as compared to Engerix-B four weeks after the third vaccination in adults age 18 and older; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | To demonstrate superiority of the seroprotection rate induced by Sci-B-Vac as compared to Engerix-B four weeks after the third vaccination in adults older than 45 years of age 

 
The study will also include multiple secondary objectives, including demonstrated non-inferiority of the seroprotection rate after two doses of Sci-B-Vac 10mcg compared to after three doses of Engerix-B 20mcg, and the overall safety and tolerability of Sci-B-Vac as compared to Engerix-B.
 
ABOUT CONSTANT - Lot-to-Lot Consistency Study
 
CONSTANT will be a double-blind, four-arm, randomized, controlled study. Approximately 3,200 adult subjects, age 18-45 years, are expected to be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive one of four three-dose courses: Lot A of Sci-B-Vac 10mcg, Lot B of Sci-B-Vac 10mcg, Lot C of Sci-B-Vac 10mcg, or the control vaccine Engerix-B 20mcg.

The primary objective of this study will be to demonstrate lot-to-lot consistency for immune response as measured by geometric mean concentration of antibodies across three independent, consecutive lots of Sci-B-Vac four weeks after the third vaccination.
 
The secondary objective will be to evaluate safety and efficacy of Sci-B-Vac as compared to Engerix-B.
 
Congenital CMV Vaccine Candidate (eVLP)

Our second lead program is a vaccine candidate for congenital CMV, a leading cause of birth defects. Our congenital CMV vaccine candidate uses our eVLP platform, based on the CMV glycoprotein B (“gB”) antigen and is adjuvanted with alum, an adjuvant used in FDA-approved products. CMV is an infection that, while common, can lead to serious complications in babies and people with weak immune systems, and is associated with a number of solid tumors, including Glioblastoma Multiform (GBM), which is a form of adult brain cancer. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each year approximately 30,000 infants are born with CMV infection in the U.S, of which about 5,000 will develop permanent problems including deafness, blindness, and developmental delays. We estimate that vaccination of all adolescent women and pre-pregnant women correlates to annual sales in the U.S. of approximately $1 billion with a $5 billion catch-up market.
 
The CMV vaccine candidate has demonstrated in early preclinical animal models, including rabbits and mice, the ability to generate anti-CMV antibodies neutralizing responses in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells.
 
Clinical Development 
 
Patient enrollment was initiated in June 2016 in a Phase I clinical study for our congenital CMV vaccine candidate. In July 2017, we announced interim data from the Phase I clinical study of safety data through day 84 of the study and initial immunogenicity signals in participant samples collected one month after the second of three planned vaccine doses. The data was as follows:

● | Safety: The vaccine was well tolerated at all doses, with no safety signals. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Immunogenicity: 


● | The vaccine induced antibody responses against the CMV glycoprotein B (gB) antigen with clear evidence of dose-dependent boosting after the second vaccination. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Immunization with the highest dose of the vaccine induced seroconversion in 100% of subjects after just two vaccinations. 
● | After two of the three planned vaccinations, neutralizing antibodies against epithelial cell infection were demonstrated in 17% of subjects who received the highest dose of VBI-1501A. 
● | The highest dose of VBI-1501A (2.0mcg of gB-G content with alum) has approximately 10-fold less antigen content than that typically used in several other eVLP-based vaccines or in past CMV vaccine candidates. 
● | Formulation of the vaccine with alum enhanced antibody titers. 

 
The final data read-out of safety and immunogenicity, following a third vaccination is expected in the first half of 2018.
 
Therapeutic GBM Vaccine Candidate (eVLP)

We have also leveraged our eVLP platform technology to develop a therapeutic GBM brain cancer vaccine candidate, VBI-1901. On August 11, 2017, the FDA accepted an IND to initiate a multi-center Phase I/IIa clinical study evaluating VBI-1901 in patients with recurrent GBM. The multi-center, open-label, two-part study will enroll up to 28 patients and is designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, and the optimal therapeutic dose level of VBI-1901. The first patient in the study received the first dose in January 2018. We expect immunologic data from ongoing biomarker analyses by mid-year 2018, and initial correlations between biomarker analyses and clinical outcomes in the second half of 2018.
 
On October 3, 2017, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted a patent on VBI-1901.

eVLP Vaccine Platform
 
On August 11, 2011, VBI Cda acquired the eVLP vaccine technology through the acquisition of ePixis. The eVLP vaccine technology allows for the expression of envelope glyco-proteins within a lipid-bilayer membrane of a virus like particle (“VLP”). The technology enables the synthetic manufacture of an “enveloped” virus like particle, or “eVLP”. Many viruses are “enveloped” in that they are surrounded by a lipid bilayer membrane. Such viruses display antigenic proteins in the surface of their “envelope” which can be targets for vaccine development. The ability to synthetically manufacture an ‘enveloped’ virus like particle is different from previously developed VLP technologies, which did not include the lipid bilayer membrane, and thus these technologies were unable to express antigenic proteins within an “envelope” as they occur in nature. In addition to the $450 initial payment for the technology and $75 in related transaction costs, we paid approximately $0, $211 and $110 in milestone payments under the e-Pixis Licensing Agreement in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
We expect to develop additional vaccine targets based on this platform, either through a partnership, or internally. In October 2017, we disclosed new data on a Zika vaccine candidate, VBI-2501, which employs the eVLP platform. The vaccine candidate contains a proprietary modified version of glycoprotein E and NS1 of Zika in a bivalent construct. Preclinical data in mice demonstrated that the bivalent produced a surprisingly superior neutralization of Zika, relative to monovalent versions. We believe that such data supports the flexibility of eVLP platform. VBI has filed for, and been granted, a patent protecting its Zika candidate which was issued on December 5, 2017.
 
In the normal course of our business, we assess and consider potential acquisition, or collaboration opportunities to gain access to, technologies or assets that are adjacent to our core competencies of immunology and formulation development. We are currently exploring this technology through partnerships with other third-party collaborators.
 
Description of Operations
 
We are headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with our manufacturing facility in Rehovot, Israel and our research facility in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The Cambridge headquarters allows us to leverage our location in a biotechnology hub, and provides us with access to experienced consultants and executive level talent.
 
We operate a proprietary, mammalian cell-derived vaccine manufacturing facility in Rehovot, Israel, which we use to manufacture Sci-B-Vac. The facility was built in December 2006 and is good manufacturing practices (“GMP”) certified by the Israeli Ministry of Health (“MoH”). It has also received MoH authorization to release vaccine batches to export markets. In 2013, the EU entered into an agreement with Israel regarding conformity assessment and acceptance of industrial products. This agreement recognizes Israel’s industrial standards as being equivalent to EU standards. It covers products for human and veterinary use (medicinal products, active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients) and procedures related to GMP. The agreement means that Israel and the EU recognize each other’s GMP inspection conclusions, manufacturing and import authorizations and certification of conformity of batches without the need for re-testing at import and official-control-authority batch release; however, our facility will have to pass FDA inspection prior to marketing Sci-B-Vac in the U.S.

Current production capabilities satisfy our current manufacturing requirements for domestic and export markets. However, in the event we receive FDA and/or EMA approval for Sci-B-Vac, our production requirements may increase beyond our current production capabilities, and we may enter into agreements with various third parties for the manufacture of Sci-B-Vac.
 
The Canadian research site benefits from its location in Canada’s National Capital Region, providing us with access to world-class research facilities at reasonable rates. This helps keep the unit cost of doing research lower compared to other locations in Canada or the U.S. VBI Cda’s active research collaboration with the Canadian federal government’s National Research Council (“NRC”) provides its staff with on-site access to the NRC’s animal facility for greater control over the testing of our vaccine candidates. NRC staff manages the general animal husbandry and maintenance requirements for VBI Cda’s animal research activities.
 
The three sites collaborate efficiently through the use of a unified information technology infrastructure and web-based video-conferencing services.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We maintain a business development function responsible for inbound and outbound licensing of our IP portfolio. We do not have a traditional sales and marketing function and distribute Sci-B-Vac in approved countries through a network of distributors. We have an active named-patient program to supply Sci-B-Vac to patients in a few countries where Sci-B-Vac has not yet been approved via partnership with local distributors.
Customers
 
Our customers for Sci-B-Vac vaccines are mainly physicians and pharmacists in markets where the product is approved. Through SciVac, services are also made available to the biotechnology industry in Israel pursuant to an agreement with the Israel Innovations Authority (formerly the Office of the Chief Scientist in Israel) and ancillary to the core vaccine development and manufacturing focus.
 
Our target customer base consists of other vaccine and biologics developers who may be interested in gaining access to our proprietary technologies and/or vaccine candidates.
 
Competitors 
 
Our products and product candidates face, and will continue to face, intense competition from large pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as academic and research institutions. We compete in an industry that is characterized by: (i) rapid technological change; (ii) evolving industry standards; (iii) emerging competition; and (iv) new product introductions. Competitors have existing products and technologies that will compete with our product candidates and technologies and may develop and commercialize additional products and technologies that will compete with our product candidates and technologies. Because several competing companies and institutions may have greater financial resources than us, they may be able to: (i) provide broader services and product lines; (ii) make greater investments in research and development (“R&D”); and (iii) carry on larger R&D initiatives. Competitors may also have greater development capabilities than we do and have substantially greater experience in undertaking nonclinical and clinical testing of products, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. They may also have greater name recognition and better access to customers.
 
We face general market competition from several subsectors of the vaccine development field, including: (i) large, multinational pharmaceutical companies including Sanofi, GSK, Merck, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited and Pfizer, Inc. (ii) mid-size pharmaceutical companies and emerging biotechnology companies including, Dynavax Technologies Corporation, Genocea Biosciences Inc., Vical, Inc. and Hookipa Biotech AG, and (iii) academic and not-for-profit vaccine researchers and developers including the National Institutes of Health and Butantan Institute. The industry is typified by extensive collaboration, licensing and merger and acquisition activity despite the intense competition.
 
Within the Hepatitis B vaccine space, we have several key competitors, including: (1) GSK, the manufacturer of Engerix-B, (2) Merck, the manufacturer of Recombivax HB, and (3) Dynavax, the manufacturer of Heplisav-B. Engerix-B was first approved in the U.S. in 1989 and is considered a global standard of care for immunization against infection caused by all known subtypes of the hepatitis B virus in all age groups. Recombivax HB was first approved in the U.S. in 1983 and has a similar label and positioning as Engerix-B. Dynavax received FDA approval for Heplisav-B in November 2017 as a 2 dose regimen for adults age 18 years and older, and based on data in head-to-head clinical studies, demonstrated statistically significantly higher rates of seroprotection compared with Engerix-B. Dynavax’s has committed to a 60,000 subject Phase IV post-marketing study. While Engerix-B and Recombivax HB are approved globally, Heplisav-B is currently only approved in the U.S. Despite the competition, we believe there are reasons our Sci-B-Vac vaccine has excellent potential, including that: (i) our vaccine contains all three surface antigens of the Hepatitis B virus, the only vaccine that contains the pre-S1 and pre-S2 antigens, which has been shown to contribute to enhanced efficacy (ii) it is adjuvanted with alum, an adjuvant that is present is several approved vaccines and has been used safely in millions of subjects commercially, in contrast to next-generation adjuvants used in other vaccines which, to the best of our knowledge, can enhance potency but does not yet have extensive safety data in commercial use, and (iii) Sci-B-Vac has an extensive data package with demonstrated efficacy and a clean safety in nearly 500,000 subjects commercially.
 
Within the CMV vaccine space, we have several key competitors, some of whom are further advanced with their CMV vaccine development, as compared to us. Among these, Merck has a highly potent vaccine based on a replication defective CMV virus with an adjuvant and is completing a Phase I study. Interim data from the Phase I was announced in the fourth quarter of 2017. Additionally, Hookipa Biotech AG has initiated clinical development of HB - 101 a prophylactic CMV vaccine based on its Vaxwave™ technology. Despite this competition, we believe there are reasons why our CMV vaccine may have some advantages, including that: (i) our vaccine is based on the successful VLP category of vaccines, which has recently been used in the successful introduction of cervical cancer vaccines, (ii) it is currently expected to use aluminum phosphate as an adjuvant, which has an extensive history of safety through its inclusion in several pediatric vaccines, and (iii) it has demonstrated competitive anti-CMV responses in preclinical animal models.

Suppliers, Contractors and Collaborations
 
Suppliers
 
We currently rely on a single source for our supply of vials and certain reagents required for the manufacture of Sci-B-Vac. Currently, we do not have supply agreements with these vendors and all orders are handled through individual purchase orders on an order-by-order basis. Alternative sources from which we can obtain our supply of these materials exist. However, we may not be able to find alternative suppliers in a timely manner that would provide supplies of these materials at acceptable quantities and prices, if at all. Any interruption in the supply of these materials would disrupt our ability to manufacture Sci-B-Vac and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Contractors
 
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with contract research organizations (“CROs”) for clinical trials and with vendors for research studies, research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice.
 
Notably, we engage CRO’s to conduct our clinical programs including the GBM Phase I/IIa clinical program, the Sci-B-Vac Global Phase III, clinical program, the Sci-B-Vac post-marketing Phase IV study and the CMV Phase I clinical program. Our reliance on these CRO’s reduces our control over these activities and involves certain risks. See risk factors on page 20.
 
We rely on a number of key contractors to characterize and release Sci-B-Vac for the Israel and other markets. While alternative contractors exist for these services, we may not be able to transition to alternative contractors in a manner that does not disrupt the normal course of manufacturing operations and the supply of Sci-B-Vac.
 
Our novel vaccine development efforts depend on a number of key suppliers to continue our research operations. We have identified the following parties as key suppliers of reagents, technology or expertise which impact our development plans with our eVLP vaccine candidates:
 

● | UPMC is the owner of the eVLP vaccine platform IP portfolio to which we have an exclusive license. Under the terms of the ePixis License Agreement, as amended, we are required to pay royalties for successful products developed using the IP for as long as claims remain valid in a given jurisdiction. This patent portfolio has claims that are expected to remain valid until 2022 in the U.S. and 2021 in other countries, after which time we are no longer obligated to compensate UPMC for development of vaccines based on the UPMC IP portfolio. After that time, the remaining patent protection of the CMV vaccine candidate will be based on patent applications filed by us, which if granted, would provide patent protection extending until 2032. There can be no assurance that any such patent applications will be granted or, if granted, be enforceable, and they may be amended to reduce the scope of patent claims. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We have collaborated with NRC on various vaccine projects since 2004 and have a long history of successful partnerships including several NRC-funded industrial research grants. The NRC is the owner of a proprietary cell line (HEK-293-NRC) that we are using for production of our eVLP-based CMV vaccine candidate. VBI Cda and the NRC have signed a research agreement that provides VBI Cda with access to NRC facilities and expertise for the advancement of the CMV vaccine candidate program. Supplementary to such research agreement, we have negotiated terms for a non-exclusive license to the HEK-293-NRC cell line. Under these terms, we will be required to pay success-based milestone payments as the CMV vaccine candidate advances into clinical development and first commercial sales. These terms also provide that no additional royalties on product sales will be required. We signed this licensing agreement in 2014. 
● | Key Reagent Suppliers: Characterization and release assays for our eVLP-based vaccines require specialized reagents. Once clinical development begins, we must ensure consistency and reliability of each reagent in its key quality control and release assays. Many of these reagents are being produced by, and therefore are in our control. Several key reagents including reference proteins and growth media are provided by third parties and can impact preclinical and clinical study start timelines. We have secured sufficient quantities of third party reference proteins and growth media for ongoing clinical studies. Supply of these key reagents remains a risk. See “Risk Factors” on page 20.

● | We, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, depend on subcontractor arrangements to facilitate the completion of our research programs. For example, Paragon Bioservices has manufactured clinical batches of our lead CMV vaccine candidate pursuant to the terms of a GMP-Manufacturing Services Agreement (the “Services Agreement”) dated September 26, 2014. In addition, on May 12, 2016, VBI Cda executed a new Statement of Work as part of the Services Agreement related to the process development and manufacture of an eVLP-based GBM vaccine candidate. The term of the Services Agreement is indefinite, although either party may terminate the Services Agreement upon written notice to the other party. The Company continues to explore alternative sources of product supply. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Collaborations
 
We also enter into contracts in the normal course of business with vendors for preclinical safety and research studies, research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice and do not include any minimum purchase commitments, and therefore are cancelable contracts.

● | On April 2, 2015, VBI Cda entered into a Collaboration and Option License Agreement (the “Sanofi Agreement”) with Sanofi., a company organized under the laws of France (“Sanofi”). Certain provisions of the Sanofi Agreement have not been publicly disclosed in accordance with an Order Granting Confidential Treatment issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on June 23, 2015. The purpose of the Sanofi Agreement is to allow Sanofi to evaluate the feasibility of using VBI Cda’s LPV technology and expertise to reformulate a Sanofi vaccine candidate (the “Sanofi Project Vaccine”) to provide improved stability (the “Sanofi Project”). VBI has completed the research as per the Sanofi Agreement and data has been shared with Sanofi. The research confirmed stabilizing properties of the LPV technology and Sanofi will continue to evaluate its fit for future programs, but has not exercised its option to apply LPV technology to the Sanofi Project Vaccine. We have no further obligations under the Sanofi Agreement and no further work is anticipated at this time.

● | On October 8, 2015, we announced that we have applied our eVLP Platform in the development of a novel therapeutic vaccine candidate for GBM with Columbia University’s Brain Tumor Center. We have not made any payments under this collaboration and the related materials transfer agreement. Our GBM vaccine candidate is currently undergoing a Phase I/IIa clinical study.

● | On February 8, 2016, VBI Cda entered into an Evaluation and Option Agreement (the “GSK Agreement”) with GSK, a company registered in Belgium (“GSK”). Certain provisions of the GSK Agreement have not been publicly disclosed in accordance with an Order Granting Confidential Treatment issued by the SEC on March 14, 2016. The purpose of the GSK Agreement is to allow GSK to evaluate the feasibility of using VBI Cda’s LPV technology and expertise to formulate a vaccine candidate using GSK’s technology. We have completed its research obligations and data has been shared with GSK as per the terms of the previously disclosed agreements. No further work is anticipated at this time.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we have a total of 98 full-time and 5 part-time employees. The SciVac manufacturing site in Israel had 66 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee and the VBI Cda research site employed 27 full-time and 4 part-time employees, as of December 31, 2017. The remaining 5 full-time employees worked out of our headquarters in Cambridge, MA. None of our employees are represented by unions. Our management considers its relationship with our employees to be good.
Facilities and Offices
 
Our registered office is located at Suite 1700, Park Place, 666 Burrard Street, Vancouver, BC V6C 2X8 with our headquarters located at 222 Third Street, Suite 2241, Cambridge, MA 02142. Our manufacturing operations are located in Rehovot, Israel and our primary research facility is located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, refer to “Part I - Item 2. Properties.”
 
We rent office, manufacturing and research facility space under various operating leases, and we made rent payments of $919 in 2017.
 
We believe that our office, manufacturing and research facilities are suitable and adequate for our current operations but will consider term extensions or expansion of leased space, depending on market conditions and needs.
 
Business Segment and Financial Information about Geographic Areas
 
We operate in one segment and therefore segment information is not presented. Our principal for financial information about our one operating and reportable segment and geographic areas, refer to “Part II—Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Part II—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 17—Segment Information.”
 
Cost of Revenues and Services
 
Cost of revenues and services includes direct costs and some allocated indirect costs related to the production, manufacturing and services activities in Israel including but not limited to the costs of materials, consumables, supplies and contractors. Once sales and production volumes increase to sufficient amount, the full cost of production, manufacturing and services will be used to calculate a gross margin, however, at this time with the current volumes, a gross margin would not provide meaningful information.
 
Research and Development
 
We invest heavily in R&D. R&D expenses were $21 million, $10 million and $14.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. All R&D was funded by equity, term loan financings or government grants and refundable R&D tax credits. Our most significant R&D expense to date has been related mainly to Sci-B-Vac, the development of our CMV vaccine candidate, and the related eVLP platform. Our R&D expenses are expected to increase significantly as we conduct and complete the Phase III Sci-B-Vac clinical program; move other vaccine candidates through the clinical development stage and explore other vaccine opportunities and/or collaborations.
 
With the acquisition of VBI DE in 2016, a significant R&D priority has been the CMV vaccine candidate’s GMP manufacturing and its clinical development. Our CMV vaccine candidate was designed internally, and its manufacturing and purification processes were designed by the NRC in collaboration with our staff. Such processes and internal knowledge were transferred to our selected GMP manufacturer, Paragon, and required significant project management expertise and confirmatory R&D studies throughout 2014. In 2015, we engaged a contract research organization, ITR Laboratories Canada Inc., and completed GLP toxicology studies to confirm the safety of the CMV vaccine candidate in animals. We initiated a Phase I clinical study in June 2016 to assess the safety and tolerability of our CMV vaccine candidate in healthy, CMV-negative adults. The study will also assess the vaccine immunogenicity by measuring levels of vaccine-induced CMV neutralizing antibodies. We completed enrollment and initial dosing of 128 participants in September 2016. As of May 2017, all participants had received the third and final immunization in the series. Interim Phase I clinical study results were reported in July 2017, and complete data are expected mid-year 2018.

As previously described, we expect to make additional R&D investments in our other eVLP vaccine candidates, and in our LPV platform, which we expect will be driven by partner-led collaborations, if any.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Patents
 
Our IP portfolio, includes 19 active patent families consisting of 132 fully owned or exclusively licensed allowed patents and patent applications, which include 60 issued patents. The highlights of our patent portfolio include:

● | CMV vaccine candidate related IP: we own two patent families which directly address our CMV vaccine candidate. These patents include a composition of matter patent describing the lead CMV vaccine candidate as well as a proprietary assay used to provide high-throughput screening of anti-CMV vaccine candidate responses. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | eVLP vaccine related IP: we have an exclusive license to three additional patent families that protect the eVLP vaccine platform and derivatives thereof. Among these patents are rights that were originally developed at the UPMC, with which we hold a world-wide exclusive license to the base technology for the design of an eVLP. 
● | LPV vaccine related IP: we own six patent families which protect our LPV technology platform. These patents include the method for manufacturing an LPV so as to confer thermostability, the proprietary ratios of excipients and antigens that are required to give rise to a thermostable formulation, and specific parameters required to confer thermostability to several distinct classes of vaccine antigens and biologic proteins. 

 
We have a process of continuously monitoring the competitive landscape for infectious disease vaccines to better understand the research, business and patent activities of our academic and industrial competitors. This process helps management to understand the competitive positioning of the lead CMV project. This knowledge has informed and shaped our patent portfolio, which is designed to protect our proprietary vaccine technologies and establish a defense against third-party infringement claims. Our earliest filed patent family (9 of which have now been issued) have a patent term that extends to 2019 in the U.S. Our licensed patent family relating to virus like particles (7 of which have now been issued) has a patent term that extends to 2021. Our most recently filed patent family will have a patent term that extends to 2037.
 
Trade Secrets
 
Some of our know-how and technology is not patentable. To protect our proprietary rights in unpatentable intellectual property and trade secrets, we require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into agreements regarding intellectual property and confidentiality information.
Trademarks
 
We use the Sci-B-Vac trademarks in connection with our hepatitis B virus vaccine product. We have registered these trademarks in 14 countries. The trademarks are renewable indefinitely, so long as we make the appropriate filings when required. We also have a registration for the LPV mark in Canada.
Governmental Regulation and Product Approval
 
Vaccine development is a highly regulated field. The manufacturing and marketing of our potential products and our ongoing research and development activities are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable regulatory agencies of local, state and foreign jurisdictions, such as Health Canada in Canada. New products must go through extensive preclinical and clinical development prior to product launch. This process can take more than ten years from candidate identification to licensure/marketing approval by health authorities worldwide. Despite efforts to harmonize regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions, there exists a divergence of legal and regulatory requirements in different countries and territories. Delays in regulatory approval to move from one stage of development to another can potentially cause us significant delays and can affect our market capitalization.

United States, Europe and Canada Regulatory Agencies.
 
Before any of our products can be marketed and sold in the U.S. Europe or Canada, they must receive approval from the relevant regulatory agencies, including the FDA, EMA or Health Canada, respectively. To receive regulatory approvals to market any drug or vaccine, including those we develop, the products in development must undergo rigorous preclinical testing and clinical studies that demonstrate the product’s safety and effectiveness for each indicated use. This extensive regulatory path includes process controls in development, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, record keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, and distribution of the pharmaceutical products.
 
In general, before any new pharmaceutical product can be marketed in the mentioned geographical areas, the process typically required by the regulatory agencies includes:
 

● | preclinical toxicology, laboratory and animal tests; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission of an investigational new drug application (an “IND”), which must be reviewed by the FDA before human clinical trials may begin; submission of a Scientific Advice application to EMA or submission of a pre-Clinical Trial Application to Health Canada; 
● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
● | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigator sites; 
● | submission of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) or NDA to the FDA or Health Canada; or submission of an MAA to the EMA; and 
● | FDA approval of a BLA NDA, or a BLA NDA supplement (for subsequent indications or other modifications, including a change in location of the manufacturing facility). EMA approval of the MAA. 

Preclinical Testing
 
In the U.S., drug candidates are tested in animals until adequate proof of safety and efficacy is established. These preclinical studies generally evaluate the mechanism of action and pharmacology of the product and assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. Tested compounds must be produced according to applicable current GMP requirements and preclinical safety tests must be conducted in compliance with FDA and international regulations regarding good laboratory practices. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are generally submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA requests an extension or raises concerns about the conduct of the clinical trials as outlined in the application. If the FDA has any concerns, the sponsor of the application and the FDA must resolve those concerns before clinical trials may begin. Regulatory authorities may require additional preclinical data before allowing the clinical studies to commence or proceed from one phase to another, and could demand that the studies be discontinued or suspended at any time if there are significant safety issues. Furthermore, an independent institutional review board for each medical center proposing to participate in the conduct of the clinical trial must review and approve the clinical protocol and patient informed consent form before commencement of the study at the respective medical center.
Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials for new vaccine drug candidates are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. In Phase I, the initial introduction of the vaccine drug candidate into human volunteers, the emphasis is on testing for safety or adverse effects, dosage, tolerance, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and clinical pharmacology. Phase II involves studies in a limited patient population to determine the initial efficacy of the vaccine drug candidate for specific targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Once a vaccine compound shows evidence of effectiveness and is found to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase II evaluations, pivotal Phase III trials are undertaken to more fully evaluate clinical outcomes and to establish the overall risk/benefit profile of the drug, and to provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. During all clinical trials, physicians will monitor patients to determine the effectiveness of the drug candidate and to observe and report any reactions or safety risks that may result from use of the vaccine drug candidate. The FDA, the trial sites internal review board and/or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.

Data from the clinical trials, together with preclinical data and other supporting information that establishes a vaccine drug candidate’s safety, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA NDA or BLA NDA supplement (for approval of a new indication if the product candidate is already approved for another indication). Under applicable laws and FDA regulations, each NDA submitted for FDA approval is usually given an internal administrative review within 45 to 60 days following submission of the BLA NDA. If deemed complete, the FDA will “file” the NDA, thereby triggering substantive review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. The FDA has established internal substantive review goals of six months for priority BLA NDAs (for vaccines or drugs addressing serious or life threatening conditions for which there is an unmet medical need) and ten months for regular BLA NDAs. However, these are agency proposed time frames, and so the FDA is not legally required to complete its review within these periods, and these performance goals may change over time. Moreover, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, is not typically an actual approval, but an “action letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the BLA NDA can be approved. The FDA’s review of a BLA NDA may involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA NDA or BLA NDA supplement if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or the FDA may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase III clinical study. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide the BLA NDA or BLA NDA supplement does not satisfy its criteria for approval.
 
Data Review and Approval
 
Substantial financial resources are necessary to fund the research, clinical trials and related activities necessary to satisfy FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies. It normally takes many years to satisfy these various legal and regulatory requirements, assuming they are ever satisfied. Information generated in this process is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval at any stage of the process. Accordingly, the actual time and expense required to bring a product to market may vary substantially. We cannot assure you that we will submit applications for required authorizations to manufacture and/or market potential products or that any such application will be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities in a timely manner, if at all. Success in early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage clinical trials. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or have conditions placed on them that restrict the commercial applications, advertising, promotion or distribution of these products.
 
Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory standards are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA also has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. The FDA may also request additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase IV studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after a drug receives approval. The results of Phase IV studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information via the FDA’s voluntary adverse drug reaction reporting system. Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to any FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the GMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a drug from distribution or withdraw approval of the NDA for that drug. Furthermore, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown negative effects of a product may result in restrictions on the product or even its complete withdrawal from the market.
 
The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. Approval is typically subject to post-marketing surveillance and other record keeping and reporting obligations, and involves ongoing requirements such as post-marketing annual reports and labeling updates. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and/or criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturers’ communications on the subject of such off-label use.

Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA)
 
Under the Federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, enacted in 2010, and specifically, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) included therein, there is an abbreviated path in the U.S. for regulatory approval of biosimilar versions of approved biological products. The PPACA provides a regulatory mechanism that enables FDA approval of biologic drugs that are similar to (but not exact copies of) innovative drugs on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. Under this regulation, an application for approval of a biosimilar may not be filed until four years after marketing approval of the innovator product. Pioneer innovative biological products will receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity, meaning that the FDA will not approve a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA.
Fast Track Approval
 
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the related FDA regulations provide certain mechanisms for the accelerated “Fast Track” approval of potential products intended to treat serious or life-threatening illnesses which have demonstrated the potential to address unmet medical needs. These procedures permit early consultation and commitment from the FDA regarding the preclinical and clinical studies necessary to gain marketing approval. Provisions of this regulatory framework also permit, in certain cases, BLA NDAs to be approved on the basis of valid indirect measurements of benefit of product effectiveness, thus accelerating the normal approval process. In the future, certain potential products employing our technology might qualify for this accelerated regulatory procedure. Even if the FDA agrees that these potential products qualify for accelerated approval procedures, FDA may deny approval of our drugs or may require additional studies before approval. The FDA may also require us to perform post-approval, or Phase IV, studies as a condition of such early approval. In addition, the FDA may impose restrictions on distribution and/or promotion in connection with any accelerated approval, and may withdraw approval if post-approval studies do not confirm the intended clinical benefit or safety of the potential product.
Orphan Drug Designation
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. These very limited circumstances are (i) an inability to supply the drug in sufficient quantities or (ii) a situation in which a new formulation of the drug has shown superior safety or efficacy. This exclusivity, however, also could block the approval of our product for seven years if a competitor obtains earlier approval of the same drug for the same indication.

Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are and will continue to be subject to a variety of laws and regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products in foreign countries. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must separately obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of those foreign countries before we may commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
Under the applicable EU regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is available for medicines produced by biotechnology or which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. This authorization is an MMA. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions.
 
Under this decentralized procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. This procedure is referred to as the mutual recognition procedure.
 
The policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products and could also increase the cost of regulatory compliance. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
 
Other Government Regulation
 
Our research and development activities use biological and hazardous materials that are dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. We are subject to a variety of federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes resulting from these materials. We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and federal, provincial and state environmental protection agencies and to regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act.
 
In addition, once our products are marketed commercially, we will have to comply with the various laws relating to the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. These federal laws include, by way of example, the following:
 

● | The anti-kickback statute (Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act) which prohibits certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid by Medicare or other governmental programs; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The physician self-referral prohibition (Ethics in Patient Referral Act of 1989, as amended, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act), which prohibits referrals by physicians of Medicare or Medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated healthcare services in which the physicians (or their immediate family members) have ownership interests or with which they have certain other financial arrangements; 
● | The anti-inducement law (Section 1128A(a)(5) of the Social Security Act), which prohibits providers from offering anything to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary to induce that beneficiary to use items or services covered by either program; 
● | The False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. § 3729 et seq.), which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government (including the Medicare and Medicaid programs); and 
● | The Civil Monetary Penalties Law (Section 1128A of the Social Security Act), which authorizes the United States Department of Health and Human Services to impose civil penalties administratively for fraudulent or abusive acts.

Sanctions for violating these federal laws include criminal and civil penalties that range from punitive sanctions, damage assessments, money penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments, or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or some combination thereof. These laws also impose an affirmative duty on those receiving Medicare or Medicaid funding to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from Medicare and other government programs.
 
We are building our government relations and regulatory capabilities by leveraging consultants who have extensive experience with the regulatory process. Consultants we have hired include Florian Schodel who led the clinical development of several vaccines through licensure at Merck Research Laboratories for over a decade.
 
We also use additional regulatory consultants including several former FDA regulators with experience at the Center for Biologics Evaluation & Research (“CBER”) which is the division of FDA that regulates vaccines and other drugs.
