Sprout Social — Powering the Evolution of Customer Experience 
With more than 3.9 billion global users consuming and sharing billions of posts per day, social media has fundamentally changed the entire customer experience. Social media is becoming mission-critical to the way organizations reach, engage and understand their target audience and customers.
Sprout Social is a powerful, centralized platform that provides the critical business layer to unlock the massive commercial value of social media. We have made it increasingly easy to standardize on Sprout Social as the centralized system of record for social and to help customers maximize the value of this mission critical channel. Currently, more than 31,000 customers across more than 100 countries rely on our platform.
Overview
Sprout Social empowers businesses to tap into the power and opportunity presented by the shift to social communication. Social media reaches almost half of the world’s population, influences buying behaviors and has changed the way the world communicates. Billions of users are sharing their interests, opinions and values with their social networks every day and are using social media to communicate with and about businesses, organizations and causes on an unprecedented scale. Virtually every aspect of business has been impacted by social media, from marketing, sales and public relations to customer service, commerce, product and strategy, creating a need for an entirely new category of software and an entirely new system of record. We offer our customers a centralized, secure and powerful platform that can scale horizontally across an organization to drive maximum business value.
Introduced in 2011, our cloud software brings together social messaging, data and workflows in a unified system of record, intelligence and action. Operating across major networks, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Google, Reddit, Glassdoor and YouTube, and commerce platforms Facebook Shops and Shopify, we provide organizations with a centralized platform to manage their social media efforts across stakeholders and business functions.
Our platform is easy-to-use and can be deployed rapidly by new customers without direct engagement from our sales or services teams. In 2021, the majority of our new customer revenue resulted from our trials and other inbound sources. Our 30-day free trial model allows prospective customers to set up and use our software within minutes and without assistance.
We operate a single code-base without the need for customizations or professional services, allowing us to efficiently scale our platform and quickly react to changes in the market. Relative to our primary competitors, our platform is the top user-rated social media management software across all major categories and customer segments according to G2, reinforcing our leading market position and brand.
We have proven success in the SMB, Mid-market and Enterprise segments, a healthy agency business and have balanced revenue and growth in each. We estimate that less than 5% of the millions of businesses on social media have adopted software solutions to centrally manage their social media efforts, providing a large, nascent opportunity to drive significantly increased market adoption of our solution and continued growth across all customer segments.
We have a highly efficient, product-driven go-to-market strategy that has enabled us to scale rapidly, attracting more than 31,000 current customers from small businesses to global brands as well as marketing agencies and government, non-profit and educational institutions. The strength of our brand and content marketing resulted in the majority of our inbound trials generated through unpaid marketing. The scale of these trials allows us to rapidly test, adapt and optimize our go-to-market approach for sustained, capital-efficient growth.
Increased adoption of our platform across functions within an organization also represents a large growth opportunity within our existing customer base. Our platform is licensed on a per-user basis with numerous upsell opportunities through additional users and product modules. As social becomes a critical channel for all aspects of the customer experience, including brand awareness, customer acquisition, social customer care, commerce, advocacy and reputation management, we expect that our customers will increase adoption of our platform across departments.
With our efficient go-to-market model and over 99% of our revenue in 2021 from software subscriptions, we have experienced strong unit economics across all customer segments as we continue to grow and refine our sales and marketing efforts. Our single code-base also creates a scalable and capital-efficient model that enables us to add new customers at little incremental cost. We believe that the single code-base and scalability of our technology are also meaningful technology differentiators.
Our success and innovation are driven by an experienced leadership team and award-winning culture with a reputation for caring deeply about the success of our customers and employees. This strong employer brand allows us to attract and retain high-quality talent and deliver a premium experience for our customers. Glassdoor has recognized us as one of the “Best Places to Work” in 2017, 2018, 2020, 2021 and 2022.
Our strong culture, world-class management team, leading platform and efficient go-to market strategy have led to revenue of $187.9 million, $132.9 million and $102.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing growth of 41% from 2020 to 2021 and representing growth of 29% from 2019 to 2020. Additionally, we generated over $224 million in annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, as of December 31, 2021. For more information on how we define and calculate ARR, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Business Metrics—ARR.” We generated net losses of $28.7 million, $31.7 million and $46.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Our Industry
Social media began as a way for individuals to connect and share experiences. Networks like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and subsequent major networks allowed individuals to more easily communicate with friends, family, colleagues and those who shared common interests. As social media grew, savvy businesses recognized its power as a channel to market to consumers at scale. A new form of advertising was born and brands rushed to establish a presence and following on social media as a powerful new way to connect with their customers.
With more than 3.9 billion users and millions of businesses adopting social media, it has fundamentally changed communication and commerce, and we are just beginning to understand its implications and importance.
We believe social media is simultaneously many things:
•social media is a facilitator of shared human experiences;
•social media is shaping our perception of the world around us;
•social media is driving consumer trends and influencing purchases;
•social media is shifting power to consumers;
•social media is holding brands to higher standards;
•social media is replacing existing communication channels; and
•social media is an unprecedented source of business intelligence.
While businesses have begun to adapt by establishing a presence on social media and incorporating social media into advertising strategies, we believe the adjustments necessary to remain competitive and relevant amidst this disruption are substantial and require new software solutions, business processes and approaches in every corner of the organization.
Social Media’s Impact on Business
Businesses must face the reality that social media is not simply a place to advertise. Social media has evolved to impact aspects of marketing, public relations, sales, customer relationships, customer service, product feedback, commerce, business intelligence and strategy. Social media is a new layer that will embed in the digital technology stack across an organization:
•Consumer influence has expanded. The ubiquity and ease of social media has enabled a new, public form of casual opinion, observation, endorsement or criticism. Social media has given consumers a powerful, public voice that can reward or penalize organizations. Organizations must listen and respond to this voice.
•The balance of power has shifted from brands to consumers. For as long as media and commerce have existed, brands have largely been in control of their message. Brands determined how and when to communicate with their audience, giving them significant control over their reputation. With the rise of social media, the balance of power has shifted to the consumer. Nearly half of the world’s population is sharing opinions across social media daily, shaping public perception and influencing purchasing decisions at enormous scale.
•Social media is driving trends and purchasing decisions. A significant number of purchasing decisions are originating from, influenced by or transacted through social media. According to Creating Connection, 76% of consumers are more likely to buy from a brand that they are connected with on social media. Additionally, Lyfe Marketing states that consumers report spending 20% to 40% more on brands that have interacted with them on social media.
•Consumer expectations are high. Consumers demand that brands be present and responsive across social networks, with more than 80% anticipating a response to a social media message within 24 hours according to Altitude. Author Jay Baer found that 39% of consumers who complain on social media expect a response within one hour and, according to The Sprout Social Index, 23% of consumers have indicated they would boycott a brand after a negative social interaction.
•All aspects of business communication are shifting to social. Billions of conversations that were previously taking place via email or over the telephone are now occurring over social media. Customers are turning to social for customer service, sales inquiries, product feedback and virtually all aspects of the customer experience. Business systems that were built around telephone and email communication cannot adequately address this shift, requiring a new system of record.
•Unprecedented business intelligence. We believe social media provides the largest source of business intelligence that has ever existed. This represents a real time pulse of consumer sentiment that is unbiased and includes a broad universe not only of current 
customers, but of potential future customers. Real-time consumer opinions, market trends, competitive insights, product performance and market research can be measured and analyzed using social data. Business decisions and strategy can be derived and validated more efficiently with data available at a larger scale than ever before.
Challenges Facing Our Target Market
The global adoption of social media requires a fundamental shift in business processes and practices across an organization. It requires recalibration and retooling on the same scale as were mandated by the historical shifts to email and telephone.
There are several challenges facing businesses trying to adapt to this new reality:
•Consumers are forcing adoption. Social media is becoming the default communication channel for consumers in coveted demographics. Consumers are expressing their opinions and talking to and about brands through billions of posts per day. Most organizations are not equipped for this new reality and must adjust their business processes and implement tools to manage this new communication channel.
•The alternative is irrelevance. A failure to solve the challenges posed by the shift to social communication would mean disconnecting from large and growing demographics. Organizations seeking to engage and connect with their audience without utilizing social tools and strategies are at a severe disadvantage.
•The stakes are incredibly high for brands. Social media gives consumers the power to put everything a brand does into the public eye and under a microscope. A misstep on social media is magnified and can lead to boycott or brand erosion overnight. The need for centralized tools with the necessary workflows, security and visibility across an organization has never been more critical. A mistake over email or the telephone is typically isolated to the sender and recipient. A mistake on social is public, permanent and can be catastrophic.
•Social touches every aspect of business. While marketers and advertisers were the early adopters of social media, its impact and importance have spread across the entire organization to customer acquisition, support, retention and growth. Like email and the telephone before it, social is not constrained to a particular business purpose. It touches the entire customer experience and impacts virtually every part of a business.
•Managing social is highly complex. Social media communication and consumption are happening billions of times per day across multiple platforms and formats, requiring businesses to be every place at once. Organizations are forced to manage dozens to hundreds of social profiles, a multitude of public and private conversations and billions of data points in real time. Managing this complex landscape in an efficient, secure and scalable manner is not viable without a centralized platform.
•It is difficult to gather intelligence. Social is one of the largest sources of business intelligence in the world and possesses the ability to answer critical questions and inform strategy. However, most organizations currently lack the tools necessary to access and analyze available data.
•Significant security and compliance concerns exist. Security and privacy issues have dominated the discussion around social media in recent years, leading to increased complexity, risk and regulation. Conforming to these requirements and maintaining security across dozens to hundreds of social profiles on multiple social networks reinforces the need for centralized management.
•Brands need a centralized solution. Managing the complexity of social media and providing a positive customer experience require that all parts of an organization share a single system of record, intelligence and action. For example, a social media message from a customer may require collaborative input and action from multiple departments at once. Without a centralized platform to provide visibility, workflow and coordination across business functions, the customer experience can become disjointed and inconsistent.

As a result, we have the highest-rated customer support of any platform in the industry according to G2 when compared to our primary competitors.
•Large and growing barriers to entry. Due to the technical complexities on the back end of social media, required network relationships and rising customer emphasis on security, compliance & data privacy, we believe the barriers to entry in our market have risen materially over the past several years. 
•World-class culture. Our success is possible because of our award-winning culture, which allows us to attract and retain top talent. We have a deep commitment to our people and our customers that compounds our competitive advantages as we continue to grow.
Our Culture
At Sprout, culture is a business strategy. We do not view culture as a set of perks but rather an intentional approach to our employees, customers and communities. We believe our culture serves as a strong competitive advantage, allowing us to build the kind of company that can lead a market, adapt and continue to innovate for our customers. We believe our ability to execute on our growth strategy is directly related to our award-winning culture with a reputation for caring deeply about our customers and our employees. This is evidenced by our top user rating on G2 and 4.8 rating and 98% CEO approval rating on Glassdoor.
Glassdoor has recognized us as one of the “Best Places to Work” in 2017, 2018, 2020, 2021 and 2022 and as having a “Highest Rated CEO” in 2017, 2018 and 2019. In 2020, we were also recognized as one of Fortune’s 100 Best Small and Medium Workplaces, one of Fortune’s 25 Best Small and Medium Workplaces for Women, and we were selected as a recipient of the 2020 Tech Cares Award from TrustRadius, awarded to tech companies that went above and beyond to support their clients and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. We were also recently ranked #3 on Battery Venture's 25 highest rated public cloud computing companies to work for during the COVID crisis. This strong employer brand allows us to continue to attract high-quality talent and deliver a premium experience for our customers. Our culture is centered on seven core values:
•Care deeply. We genuinely and deeply care about our customers, people, communities and families. We cannot serve one of these groups without serving them all well.

The alignment of our values and shared goals allows us to move quickly in a space that is constantly evolving.
Our Market Opportunity
Due to social media’s rapidly growing strategic importance, we believe all organizations of adequate scale around the globe would benefit from using a social media management solution to engage with their consumers and drive insights from social data. We also believe our platform addresses this significant capability gap, serving what we refer to as the social media management market.
We estimate that, based on our current average customer spending levels, the annual served addressable market (SAM) for our platform in 2021 exceeded $44 billion. We estimate that our SAM opportunity will exceed $100 billion by 2025, an annual market growth rate of greater than 20%.
We calculated our current SAM estimate as follows: (i) utilized data from The U.S. Small Business Administration, The U.S. Census Bureau, The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and Statista to estimate the total number of businesses in the United States and globally in each of our served market segments (Enterprise, Mid-Market, SMB) with a social media presence; (ii) utilized internal data and estimates to estimate the number of such businesses that require a social media management platform (the “Target Businesses”); (iii) calculated the average of our ACV and our estimate of our primary competitors’ ACVs in each segment; and (iv) multiplied the estimated average segment ACVs by the estimated number of Target Businesses in each segment.
We calculated our greater than $100 billion 2025 SAM forecast using the methodology above. We used internal estimates informed by research from the Harris Poll to determine the projected business presence on social media in 2025 that will require a social media management platform, multiplied by our internal projected average segment ACVs in 2025 for Sprout Social and its primary competitors in the applicable segment.
Our Growth Strategies
We intend to capitalize on our large market opportunity with the following key growth strategies:
•Acquire new customers. We believe there is a substantial opportunity to increase adoption of our solution. We have experienced strong organic new customer growth due to low-friction, self-serve onboarding that allows us to acquire customers with relatively low sales and marketing investment. We intend to aggressively pursue new customers with increasing efficiency in our go-to-market approach while expanding our sales capacity. Although many new customers adopt our solution during their first engagement with us, we intend to drive higher conversion of new trials through various sales, marketing and product initiatives as one component of our customer acquisition strategy.
•Further penetrate our existing customer base. We believe we can achieve significant organic growth by expanding penetration of our existing customer base with the addition of new users, new add-on products and new use-cases for our platform. As social media drives businesses to evolve their strategies holistically across customer service and support, corporate communications, product development and recruiting and training, we believe that we have a significant opportunity to increase our sales further into, and outside of, the marketing business unit.
•Continue to innovate and develop new products. We are focused on investing in research and development to continue to enhance our platform and release new features and we have one of the largest independent datasets of consumer social media presence. As we make this investment, we expect to develop new products leveraging our valuable dataset and broadening our offerings, while expanding into adjacent markets.
•Expand into international markets. We are still early in the global adoption curve for social media solutions, which presents a large opportunity to capture market share in an underserved and growing market. As we invest in acquiring new customers, we expect to continue to develop our presence in international markets, such as Europe, Australia and New Zealand, to address this large opportunity. For example, we opened an office in Dublin, Ireland to better serve the EMEA market, and we have sales representatives in Canada, the United Kingdom, Singapore, India and Australia.
Our Platform
Social media has created significant opportunities for businesses to reach, acquire, retain and connect with their customers. It has also introduced a high level of complexity and the need for a centralized platform to manage these efforts across the organization. Our platform brings all of the necessary tools together for organizations to expertly and efficiently manage this new channel and create compelling experiences for their audience.
Our powerful, easy-to-use cloud platform allows organizations of all sizes to create stronger relationships through social media, create and publish effective content, measure and improve performance and better understand their markets and customers.
We provide robust and fully integrated tools across a variety of functions:
•Social Engagement / Response;

•Reporting and Analytics;
•Social Listening and Business Intelligence;
•Reputation Management;
•Social Commerce;
•Employee Advocacy; and
•Automation and Workflows.
These tools serve a broad range of use-cases within our customers’ organizations including:
•Social and Community Management;

•Marketing;
•Customer Service and Care;
•Commerce;
•Sales and Customer Acquisition;

Ease of Use / Implementation
Our platform does not require long deployment and implementation cycles, or high services costs to maintain.

We believe our product is the industry standard for product quality, design and user experience, taking the complexity of social and putting it in one simple platform so our customers can focus on growing their business. 
Moving at the Pace of Social
Keeping pace with the evolution of social networks alongside our customers’ usage is a prerequisite for our success. We believe our competitive advantage is partly due to the relationships we have built with the social networks over the past nine years. These relationships have enabled us to actively collaborate in lockstep with their respective product and engineering teams to roll out new features for our customers.
Components of our Platform
Engagement: managing social media conversations
Social media messaging has taken the place of telephone and email for many customer and business interactions. Our engagement tools allow our customers to efficiently and effectively receive and respond to messages across social platforms and provide the collaboration and visibility necessary to create seamless customer experiences across the organization.
•Smart inbox. We bring public and private messages from across social networks and profiles into a single, unified inbox. This allows our customers to centralize interactions with their audiences and customers and provides the necessary tools and workflows to deliver seamless customer experiences.
•Social CRM. When interacting across social channels, context is important. We provide historical conversations, notes and user information in-line to ensure responses are relevant and productive.
•Social monitoring and alerts. In addition to messages sent to our customers, our platform also captures messages relating to our customers, for awareness and response when needed. We also provide an alerts engine to notify our customers when critical messages are received.
•Customer service tools. Many of the messages received through social media are customer service related. We provide tools to route and assign messages, and to measure the performance of our customer’s customer service efforts through social media.
•Automation. We provide our customers the ability to automate alerts and categorization of messages, as well as a bot-builder technology that can automate high-volume customer conversations in private social channels.
Publishing: plan and publish effective content
Publishing effective, compelling content on social media is critical to growing an audience and keeping them engaged. We provide the tools necessary to plan, create and publish content to reach the right audience, with the right message at the right time.
•Centralized content planning, creation and publishing. We enable customers to create text and multimedia content to be sent across multiple social networks using an intuitive publishing interface, as well as a shared publishing calendar and campaign organization for collaboration across teams and departments.
•Automated scheduling. Our platform allows content to be scheduled across social networks immediately or at specific dates and times. Content can also be drafted, added to an automated queue or sent using our patented Viralpost technology for optimal reach. Viralpost uses machine learning to determine the best times to reach a customer’s most engaged audience.
•Content performance reporting. We provide reporting and analytics on the performance of content and campaigns to help our customers better understand their performance and increase the effectiveness of their publishing efforts.
•Suggested content. We help customers identify compelling content to share with their audience based on global trends. We surface content such as posts that have been shared widely across major social networks so that customers can better understand what content is resonating with their audiences.
•Message approval workflows. Publishing content to social media often requires approvals from within an organization. We provide the workflows to obtain these approvals from single or multiple parties prior to posting to social media.
•Publishing permissions & governance. Maintaining control over social media publishing permissions and records of publishing activity is critical for security and compliance. Our granular permissions allow customers to grant access as needed without sharing critical social profile credentials and records all publishing and approval activity.
•Content and asset libraries. Social media content and campaigns are often shared and repurposed across an organization. We provide libraries for shared content and assets that can be used across teams, locations or departments.
Analytics: measure and improve your social media performance
Our reporting suite helps our customers drive strategic decision making across their business with access to rich social data and analytics. We provide them the tools to measure their effectiveness and productivity, benchmark against peers, measure content performance and business impact, and gain insights on areas of improvement.
•Comprehensive social media reporting. Our customers can measure and analyze their performance across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and LinkedIn through rich experiences designed to extract actionable insights from data. Reporting can be done across networks, analyzing paid and organic performance compared to historic and peer or competitor performance.
•Content performance reporting. Measuring the effectiveness, reach and reaction to published content allows our customers to optimize their social publishing efforts to drive incremental value for their audiences.
•Customer service and team reporting. Customer service conducted through social media requires rapid response and resolution. Our service- and support-focused reports allow our customers to understand their response rates and times, measure team member activity, measure net promoter scores and benchmark against peers.
•Custom report builder. In addition to our presentation-ready reports, customers can customize reports to meet their needs, and export those reports in several formats to share with peers and stakeholders across their business.
•Reporting API. Data provided in our reporting suite can be delivered via API for integration with existing business intelligence tools.
Social Listening: business intelligence at scale
Every day, hundreds of millions of data points are created across social networks that contain information that can help businesses better understand their markets, their customers and their 
competition. We provide affordable, powerful and approachable tools to access this rich data in order to make better business decisions. Social data is a real-time focus group at a global scale. 
•Market research. We provide dynamic visualizations of historical and real-time analysis of our customer’s social data so they can extract actionable insights and make better business decisions. 
•Brand health. Our customers can monitor their brand’s general health, analyze campaign performance and gain visibility into consumer needs and sentiment drivers to help them understand and improve their brand performance.
•Competitive insights. Our customers can identify opportunities to differentiate their brand, products and services through competitor comparison, sentiment research and share of voice analysis. This helps them to keep ahead of their competition.
•Consumer trends. We provide a cross-channel conversational analysis to help our customers uncover emerging trends and identify influencers to fine-tune campaigns to strengthen market positioning.
•Product feedback. Social conversations often point to product related feedback. Our customers can leverage these consumer insights to upgrade their customer experiences and refine products and services.
Additional features:
As social media use expands throughout our customers’ organizations, their use-cases and needs expand. We respond to these increasing demands by continuously enhancing our platform and expanding our offering.
•Social Commerce. Commerce transactions are shifting to social, which is a primary point of product discovery for consumers. We allow brands to easily link their commerce platforms, currently Shopify and Facebook Shops, for a unified view of product catalogs, SKU availability and purchase history, which help inform proactive marketing efforts and create seamless, unified customer service experiences.
•Reputation management. Brand reputations are being shaped by social media and customer review sites. We provide customers a seamless, integrated solution to manage their reputation across review sites and social media.
•Employee advocacy. An organization’s employees are highly trusted by their followers and can extend a brand’s reach on social media. Our advocacy solutions allow our customers to distribute pre-approved content to their team to facilitate sharing across the individual’s social network.
•Mobile applications. Social media is 24/7 and extends well beyond the work day. Our mobile applications give our customers access to our platform on any current Android or iOS device.
•Chat bot creation and management. To manage high volumes of customer messaging, we provide our customers with an intuitive interface to build and deploy chat experiences to help their audience get the information they need quickly and efficiently.

As of December 31, 2021, our sales and marketing department had 433 employees. Our sales and marketing expenses were $84.2 million, $59.1 million and $55.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Customer Service
Our global support team provides support to all of our customers, regardless of spend or segment, in the channel they prefer.

As a result, we have the highest-rated customer support according to G2 when compared to our primary competitors. 
We provide 24/7 support through email, telephone, chat and social media and weekend support through email and social. We also offer support in English, Spanish, Portuguese and French to our global customer base.
As of December 31, 2021, our customer service department had 47 employees. Customer service costs are included in Cost of revenue within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Research and Development
We have a proven research and development team that rapidly delivers high-quality products, which has driven our customer growth. Our ability to lead in the social media management market depends on our introduction of new products and continuing to improve our current offerings. We work diligently to respond to our customers’ needs to create the best user experience possible. 
Our research and development team is responsible for the design, development and testing of our products. We invest substantial resources in research and development to drive our technology innovation and bring new products to the market. As of December 31, 2021, our research and development department had 206 employees. Our research and development expenses were $40.0 million, $30.5 million and $28.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Competition
There are a number of established and emerging competitors in the social media management software market. While the market remains fragmented, there has been increasing consolidation in recent years with rising barriers to entry. We consider the competitive differentiators in our market to be:
•all-in-one platform;
•scalability of the platform;
•ease of use, security and reliability; and
•ease & cost to deploy and run the platform.
We believe we compete favorably on all of these factors.
We primarily face competition from other social media management companies such as Sprinklr, Khoros and Hootsuite, as well as a range of independent point solutions. In order to compete, we work tirelessly to innovate and improve our products, while at the same time, preserving our unique culture. 
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, a variety of contractual arrangements, such as license agreements, assignment agreements, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality procedures and technical measures to protect rights in our proprietary property.
We have three issued U.S. patents and two U.S. patent applications pending. We also have one pending European patent application. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. 
We actively pursue registration of our trademarks, logos, service marks and domain names in the United States and in other key jurisdictions. We are the registered holder of a variety of domain names that include the term “Sprout Social” and similar variations. We also own numerous trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos and design marks, including SPROUT SOCIAL and our leaf logo. 
In addition to our registered intellectual property, we rely on trade secrets and confidential information to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our trade secrets and 
confidential information through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties who may have access to our proprietary information. We also require most employees to sign agreements, pursuant to which such they assign to us any inventions, developments and other technology generated by them on our behalf. 
Accordingly, while we believe our intellectual property is sufficiently protected, the failure to obtain or the loss of some of these rights could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, including through litigation as necessary. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our business.”
Government Regulation
The legal environment of Internet-based businesses is evolving rapidly in the United States and elsewhere. The manner in which existing laws and regulations are applied in this environment, and how they will relate to our business in particular, both in the United States and internationally, is often unclear. For example, we sometimes cannot be certain which laws will be deemed applicable to us given the global nature of our business, including with respect to such topics as data privacy and security, pricing, credit card fraud, advertising, taxation, content regulation and intellectual property ownership and infringement.
Our customers, and those with whom they communicate using our platform, upload and store data onto our platform, generally without any restrictions imposed by us. This presents legal challenges to our business and operations, such as rights of privacy or intellectual property rights related to the content loaded onto our platform. Both in the United States and internationally, we must monitor and comply with a host of legal concerns regarding the data stored and processed on our platform as well as the operation of our business. These laws include, without limitation, the following:
Data Privacy and Security Laws
In the ordinary course of our business, we may process personal data. Accordingly, we are, or may become, subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards related to data privacy, security, and protection. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“EU GDPR”), and the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom (“UK”) law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK GDPR”). In addition, several states within the United States have enacted or proposed data privacy laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act. 
The CCPA and EU GDPR are examples of the increasingly stringent and evolving regulatory frameworks related to personal data processing that may increase our compliance obligations and exposure for any noncompliance. For example, the CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide specific disclosures related to the business’s collection, use, and disclosure of personal data and to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal data (for example, requests to know of the business’s personal data processing activities, to delete the individual’s personal data, and to opt out of certain personal data disclosures). Also, the CCPA provides for civil penalties and a private right of action for data breaches which may include an award of statutory damages. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), which becomes effective on January 1, 2023, will expand the CCPA. The CPRA will, among other things, give California residents the ability to limit a business’s use of certain sensitive personal data, establish restrictions on personal data retention, expand the types of data breaches that are subject to the CPRA’s private right of action, and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law. 
European data privacy and security laws (including the EU GDPR and UK GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. For example, the EU GDPR applies to any company established in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. These obligations may include limiting personal data processing to only what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; requiring a legal basis for personal data processing; requiring the appointment of a data protection officer in certain circumstances; increasing transparency obligations to data subjects; requiring data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; limiting the collection and retention of personal data; increasing rights for data subjects; formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consents; requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal data; mandating notice of certain personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority(ies) and affected individuals; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the UK and/or the EU in certain circumstances.
See the section titled “Risk Factors—Legal and Regulatory Risks” for additional information about the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject and about the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
Copyright & Trademark
U.S. and international copyright and trademark laws protect the rights of third parties from infringement of their intellectual property. Our customers can use our platform to upload and present a wide variety of content. In general, our customer terms of service state that customers agree not to, nor authorize or permit any third parties to use our products to post, upload, link to, send, distribute, or store any content that is protected by copyright, trademark, or any other proprietary right without first having obtained all rights, permissions, and consents necessary to make such content available on or through our products. As our business expands to other countries, we must respond to regional and country-specific intellectual property considerations, including takedown and cease-and-desist notices in foreign languages, and we must build infrastructure to support these processes. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, also applies to our business in the United States. This statute provides relief for claims of circumvention of copyright-protected technologies but includes a safe harbor that is intended to reduce the liability of online service providers for listing or linking to third-party websites or hosting content that infringes copyrights of others. The copyright infringement practices that we have implemented for our platform are intended to satisfy the DMCA safe harbor.
Culture and Workforce
As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 887 full-time employees, including 141 employees located outside the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
Our commitment to our employees is to foster a culture that enables every member of the Sprout team to do their best work in the most fulfilling way possible. We strive to honor this commitment by prioritizing employee engagement and development; diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI); and employee benefits and wellness.
Employee Engagement & Development:
•To ensure an active feedback loop, we field employee inclusion and engagement surveys. In 2021, topics included the remote work environment, talent development needs, and our culture of feedback. The feedback we received regarding remote work continues to inform and shape our strategy for our future as a distributed and hybrid work environment as well as our performance-focused culture.
•We have developed programs designed to ensure Sprout is a career accelerator for employees of all backgrounds, including introducing our comprehensive leadership development program known as GOLD (Growth Oriented Leadership Development). GOLD consists of three targeted programs. Ignite focuses on new leaders including those new to the role of leadership itself or to leadership at Sprout. Evolve is tailored towards experienced managers and directors, and Amplify (launching in 2022) is designed for our most senior leaders including members of our executive team. In addition, our Grow@ digital and on-demand platform provides education and development opportunities through internal programs and third party vendors.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion:
•In August 2021, we released our second demographic report to provide transparency into where we stand, where we’ve progressed and where we need to improve in the areas of DEI. We intend to continue to report our progress against the initiatives identified on an ongoing basis. 
•We focused our sourcing efforts on underrepresented backgrounds and held our Recruitment Team accountable to prospecting diverse talent.
•To ensure our employees support and help drive our DEI efforts, all new hires participate in unconscious bias training as part of their onboarding. 
•We encourage our employees to attend our monthly, employee-led DEI Guild meetings to discuss relevant topics such as centering marginalized voices within the queer community, ableism, and elevating women in the workplace. We avoid scheduling any other meetings during this time so employees can prioritize DEI education.
•Our Community Resource Groups (CRGs), such as Black@, LGBTQ@, Women@, and Accessibility (A11y), provide space for team members to connect with those who share a common identity. CRGs are centered around common identities and life experiences. These volunteer-led groups work to serve the unique needs of their community members and foster a sense of belonging through connection, support and empathy. Each group works with an executive sponsor and presents their strategic plans to our Executive Team. In 2021, we added two new CRGs, Veterans@ and Interfaith@, bringing the total number of CRGs to ten.
•Our Always Be Growing Enrichment Program is a leadership-sponsored program focused on investing additional instruction, education, and support to our Black, Indigenous, and People of Color employees who are individual contributors. 
•We partner with community organizations like re:work to improve hiring, retention and promotion of underrepresented talent.
•We actively recruit from Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Hispanic Serving Institutions, including partnering with student organizations that serve traditionally underrepresented groups in tech. In 2021, we partnered with the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) to create a scholarship program for Black/African American software engineering students.
Compensation, Benefits, and Employee Wellness:
To recruit and retain the best talent in the marketplace, we routinely refresh our total rewards program:
•In addition to competitive salaries, stock-based compensation awards, and flexible healthcare and insurance benefits, we offer the following programs, which vary by country/region: paid time off, family leave, flexible work schedules and 401(k) matching.
•As part of our progression towards a true hybrid work environment, we reopened our offices in 2021 on a voluntary basis to provide options to those who prefer or need an office based setting. Numerous safety protocols were implemented to create a safe environment for those wishing to work within our office spaces. We continue to provide a stipend to all new employees to ensure an optimal home setup. In addition to providing employees tools through platforms like Modern Health and our Employee Assistance Program, in October 2021, our DEI Guild meeting topic was “Work Reset: Redefining our Work Environment” providing employees the opportunity to hear from a best-selling author and psychotherapist on building resilience and combating burnout.
