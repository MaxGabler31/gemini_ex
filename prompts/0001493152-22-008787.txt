ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------+---------

Introduction
 
OmniLit Acquisition Corp. (“OLIT,” the “Company,” “we” or “us”) is a newly organized blank check company incorporated on May 20, 2021 and formed as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Form 10-K as our initial business combination. We may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry or sector, but we expect to focus on acquiring a business combination target within the advanced manufacturing industry, specifically the photonics or optics sectors, and related sectors, with an enterprise value of approximately $350 million to $750 million. Management believes that this relative size of target opportunities will enable us to pursue companies that are the most attractive from a return standpoint and are less pursued by larger, more established sources of capital.
Leadership
 
Al Kapoor has been our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors since our inception in May 2021. Al has engaged in finding, acquiring, and growing optics and photonics companies since 1997 as a technology entrepreneur immediately after graduating Harvard Business School. Shortly thereafter he found and acquired his first advanced manufacturing company in Rochester New York, renamed it Syntec Optics, transformed it into a defense, medical and consumer optics and photonics leader, and accelerated growth with add-on acquisitions. Mr. Kapoor has extensive experience identifying, evaluating, and executing acquisitions, and has led multiple operating companies across the advanced manufacturing industry. Of note, Mr. Kapoor has built Syntec Optics, a full-service and integrated optics and photonics solution provider over the last 20+ years through a combination of strategic acquisitions, operational improvements and focused end market expansion and diversification. Syntec Optics is now a leading solution provider of high technology and strategically sourced optics and photonics components to many Fortune 500 Companies in sensitive product areas such as Aerospace, Defense and Healthcare, among others. Over the course of Mr. Kapoor’s career, he has developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships, including deep networks in the optics and photonics industry that we believe will serve to identify and vet potential combination targets. This deep technical and business experience has led to diverse relationships in the optics and photonics ecosystem – suppliers, customers, end-users, venture capitalists, private equity managers, entrepreneurs, and executives. Al runs an app called PioneeringMinds with a fortnightly newsletter on future industries with circulation of over 100,000 to executives around the country. He continues to invest in optics and photonics, from driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality, sensors, to terabit internet. He is also on the advisory council for MIT’s program to train and educate the workforce for new disruptions in the area of integrated photonics. Al has been invited to the White House on several occasions to participate in innovation policy discussions. Al studied various disciplines of engineering and business at 5 universities earning an MBA from Harvard University and MS from Iowa State University.

Business and Investment Strategies
 
While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry, our investment strategy will focus our efforts in the advanced manufacturing industry, specifically the photonics and optics products, services, and end-markets, and related products, services, and end-markets. Our initial business combination and value creation strategy will be to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, implement an operating strategy with a view of creating value for our stockholders through operational improvements, capital infusion, or future acquisitions. We intend to source initial business combination opportunities through our management team’s broad network of investors in the advanced manufacturing industry, board members, company executives, lawyers, accountants, and brokers.
 
We believe that technology and globalization are creating enormous opportunities for disruption and value creation in advanced manufacturing. Many of these technologies can be transformative for varied markets but require the right expertise and global connections to capture opportunities within public markets. Within the broader market space of advanced manufacturing, we intend to concentrate on sourcing business combination opportunities that serve, or can be transformed to supply solutions to, the optics and photonics market.
 
Our investment thesis is rooted in the following core beliefs that will influence the types of investment opportunities that we will target.
 We believe that businesses involved in the design, development, manufacturing, operation, and distribution of optics and photonics assets will benefit from strong tailwinds in years to come and may represent attractive acquisition opportunities.
 
Optics and Photonics Industry Report 2020 estimated that the manufacturing sector contributes 30% of global gross domestic product (“GDP”) annually, or an estimated $26.3 trillion, and optics and photonics comprise a substantial amount of this market. The optics and photonics market, the value of light-enabled products and services, is estimated to be between $7 trillion and $10 trillion annually, and represents roughly 11% of the world’s economy. Within this end-market, it is estimated that global annual revenue for photonics-enabled products and services had exceeded $2 trillion in 2019. Photonics touches most sectors of our economy including consumer electronics (barcode scanners, DVD players, TV remote controls), telecommunications (fiber optics, lasers, switches), health (eye surgery, medical instruments, and imaging), industrial (laser cutting and machining), Défense and Security (Infrared cameras, remote sensing, aiming) and entertainment (holography, cinema projection). We believe accelerating optics and photonics innovation will continue to drive economic growth and increase its share of the global GDP.
 
The most recent review from the Optics & Photonics 2020 Industry Report valued the 2019 photonics-enabled products and services at $2.02 trillion – an increase of 34% over the seven-year period, and a compound annual growth (CAGR) rate of 4.2%, from 2012 to 2019, shown below by end market.
 
The potential use of photonics in varied industries is fueling growth of the optics and photonics market. We believe sectors including telecom, transportation, healthcare, energy, aerospace, security, defense & space exploration, consumer, retail, electronics, food & agriculture, artificial intelligence software, and robotics are in the early stages of a dramatic transformation of scope and scale due to the unprecedented developments in advanced manufacturing of optics and photonics products, sub-systems, components, and materials. Continued mobility, intelligence, automation, sensing, and safety needs will accelerate in years to come, which will create a large market opportunity for such enabling businesses at the forefront of optics and photonics. The global optics and photonics sectors have experienced demand increasing use of photonics in various applications.
 
The Optics & Photonics 2020 Industry Report estimated revenue growth for top five areas based on CAGR from 2012 to 2019. These areas are listed below, as examples of verticals that we intend to focus on:
 

● | Sensing, monitoring, and control (+10%), autonomous systems and the internet-of-things continued to create demand for a wide variety of photonic sensors. Self-driving cars, drones, and other robotics systems utilize a wide range of photonic sensors and imaging systems, some of which are increasingly benefiting from embedded artificial intelligence. Developments in the emerging field of quantum technology should drive major advances in metrology, sensing, communications, and computing, creating what we believe will be a multitude of new opportunities in photonics.

● | Advanced manufacturing (+8%), gains in this segment were led by lasers for materials processing while robotics and vision technologies maintained their momentum as did implementation of 3D printing/additive manufacturing. Photonics-based production tools including lasers, optical metrology, and machine vision combined with adoption of rapid prototyping and Industry 4.0 are driving big manufacturing changes in industries like aerospace and automobiles. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Semiconductor processing (+8%), driven by demand for optical processing and metrology equipment. Opto-electronics and mobility, integrated photonics circuits are beginning to address applications that were typically addressed by integrated electronic circuits. POC Biosensing, terabit internet, lidar based radar, and telecom are areas that are being disrupted due to reduced cost, size, weight, and power consumption while still improving performance and reliability. Design, develop, and manufacturing processes are similar to micro-electronics. Integrated photonics is envisioned to play the role in industry 4.0 what electronic integrated circuits did in industry 3.0. 
● | BioMedical (+13%), growth in diagnostic imaging, digital pathology, in vitro diagnostics, and point-of-care diagnostics led broad- based gains across this segment. Food safety testing also saw a significant uptick. Looking ahead, cost-effective photonics-based diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices are achieving higher market penetration. 
● | Defense, safety, and security (+10%), driven by gains in more than 30 sub-segments combined with substantial upswings in video surveillance, perimeter security and sensing, and investment in equipment for directed energy systems. Infrared systems, hyperspectral imaging, and laser-based countermeasures are all deployed, while laser weapons are emerging as a real near-term possibility. We believe there may be increased demand for aiming, scoping, and targeting using optics and photonics. 

 
Industry 4.0 is revolutionizing the advanced manufacturing sector
 
This fourth industrial revolution (“Industry 4.0”), which encompasses the internet-of-things and smart manufacturing, marries physical production and operations with digital technology, machine learning / artificial intelligence and big data to create a more holistic and connected ecosystem for companies that focus on manufacturing and supply chain management. As industry 4.0 continues to bring changes in manufacturing, technological advancements leading to innovative photonics-enabled products, and photonics are improving manufacturing performance with photonics-enabled technology. We expect Industry 4.0 to transform production by driving faster, more flexible and more efficient processes which will be monetized by companies through the production of higher-quality goods at reduced costs.
 
Beyond the traditional industrial automation, new transforming products from unmanned aircrafts and driverless cars, smart robots in the operating rooms and artificial intelligence of organ and tissue imaging, to augmented and virtual reality increasingly require optics and photonics imagers, sensors, and detectors. We expect this trend to be especially pronounced in the United States, which has seen automation as a way to be globally competitive in spite of rising wages.
 
Optics and photonics are an integral aspect of the ongoing advancement of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices. Optics and photonics can reduce cost, size, weight, and power consumption in all spheres of technology that is making us smarter. These includes our content, its context, inter-connection for exchange, and various types of content - from imaging to detection and sensing. Mr. Kapoor has operated extensively across this advancing ecosystem of customers, suppliers, and business operators, which is at the overlapping intersection on contextual technology, content technology, connected technology, and imaging, detecting, and sensing technology. The advanced technologies, which are beneficiaries and drivers of this ecosystem include artificial intelligence, quantum computing, internet-of-things, driverless cars, robotics, 3D printing, and other new technologies.
 
Business Combination Criteria
 
Our business combination criteria will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic sector, but given the experience of our management team, we expect to focus on acquiring a business combination target within the advanced manufacturing industry, with a focus on optics and photonics, with an enterprise value of approximately $350 million to $750 million. Our management team will look to identify business combination targets which are in need of strategic growth capital, will benefit from becoming a publicly listed company, may require creative business approaches to unlock additional value, or may need to repurchase debt, target strategic acquisitions or require working capital.
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.
 

● | Services & end markets. We intend to pursue targets within a space that has many varied offerings based on diversity of manufacturing processes, wavelength of light used, materials, and whether the offering is a component, sub-system or OEM. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Diversity of sectors. Our strategy is to acquire a participant with potential in the wide range of end-market. We intend to build sustainable value with a company that provides us a platform of diverse sectors, R&D spend, vertical integration, and design-for-manufacturability. We intend to focus on active or passive optics and photonics as entry point as the industry overall is quite fragmented. 
● | Proprietary pipeline and deal flow. We intend to find and acquire companies off the radar screen of other acquirers with deal flow from a deep professional network & research of new sciences and technologies. Deals will be assessed for social disruption in their sectors using proprietary models. 
● | Geography. We intend to initially focus on well-established optics and photonics capabilities in the United States markets. 
● | Barriers to entry and differentiation. We intend to focus on businesses that provide differentiated industrial solutions and ability to pivot or extend to optics and photonics and that possess high barriers to entry and a certain degree of technological differentiation and manufacturing complexity embedded in their platform; have defensible proprietary technology and intellectual property rights that are significantly differentiated and superior to attract good talent.

-


● | Scalability and growth. We intend to focus on businesses that are scaled or have ability to scale within their large addressable market with R&D and capex; and are on a promising organic growth path, driven by a sustainable competitive advantage, with opportunities for acceleration by add-on acquisitions. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Financial and regulatory processes and controls. We intend to focus on businesses that have robust compliance, financial controls and reporting processes in place and that we believe are ready for the regulatory requirements of a public entity, or have the potential to timely implement appropriate public company reporting, compliance and financial controls under the guidance of our management team. 

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe the sourcing, valuation, diligence, and execution capabilities of our management team will provide us with a significant pipeline of opportunities from which to evaluate and select a business that will benefit from our expertise.

● | Strong Management Team. We will leverage the extensive experience of our management team, all of whom have been involved at various levels in acquisitions, financings, and advisory transactions, totaling billions in transaction value, and have significant experience investing in a variety of economic cycles, with a track record of identifying high-quality assets with opportunities for optimization. We believe our management team’s ability to originate, effectively diligence, and creatively and thoughtfully structure transactions will generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for investors. We believe we will benefit from our management team’s successful track record in technology and business services industry, including experiences serving as corporate executives and board members for various companies, both public and private.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Broad Sourcing Channels and Leading Industry Relationships. We believe the capabilities and relationships associated with our management team will provide us with a differentiated pipeline of attractive business combination opportunities that would be difficult for other market participants to replicate. 
● | Underwriting, Execution, and Structuring Capabilities. Our management team will apply to our acquisition targets a rigorous analytical review and diligence process that its individual members apply or have applied in their current or past professional experiences. The sensitivity of financial and operational drivers to external factors is a key component of evaluating investment opportunities and pricing risk. We believe our investment discipline will allow us to identify opportunities where our management team can create stockholder value, which may include operational or capital structure improvements, as well as the introduction of new technologies and/or products to drive growth. 
● | Public Company Operating Expertise. As a result of serving as executive officers and directors of publicly traded companies, our management team has substantial experience in navigating the challenges of operating as a public company. We anticipate that one or more members of our management team or board, would remain on the board of the company post business combination. In addition, some of the potential acquisition targets we consider may operate within a regulated industry. We believe that the expertise within our management team around technology and business services industries will be advantageous when evaluating certain acquisition targets. 

Initial Business Combination
 
Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.
 
We will have until 15 months from the closing of our initial public offering consummated on November 12, 2021, which we refer to as our IPO, to consummate an initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 15 months, we will, by resolution of our board, if requested by OmniLit Sponsor LLC, whom we refer to as our sponsor, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by an additional three months up to twice (for a total of up to 21 months to complete a business combination), subject to the sponsor depositing additional funds into the trust account as set out below. In connection with any such extension, public stockholders will not be offered the opportunity to vote on or redeem their shares. Pursuant to the terms of our certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees must deposit into the trust account $1,437,500 (or $0.10 per share) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. We will only be able to extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by an additional three months twice (for a total of six months). We will issue a press release announcing each extension, if any, at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we will issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline, announcing whether the funds have been timely deposited. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are obligated to fund the trust account in order to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination, but our sponsor will not be obligated to extend such time.

-


We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either: (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses; or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the “Investment Company Act.” Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% of net assets test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.
 
Our Initial Business Combination Process
 
In evaluating prospective business combinations, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review process that will encompass, among other things, a review of historical and projected financial and operating data, meetings with management and their advisors (if applicable), on-site inspection of facilities and assets, discussion with customers and suppliers, legal reviews and other reviews as we deem appropriate.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 
Members of our management team indirectly own shares of Class B common stock issued prior to our IPO, which we refer to as our founder shares, and warrants issued in a private placement completed concurrently with our IPO, which we refer to as the private warrants, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors were to be included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. However, subject to any pre-existing contractual or fiduciary obligations, our sponsor and officers and directors will offer all suitable business combination opportunities within the technology industry (and other related sectors) to us before any other person or company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of our IPO (or up to 21 months from the closing of our IPO, if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination).
 
Members of our management team are employed by or otherwise work with our sponsor or with other entities. Our sponsor and these other entities and their respective affiliates are continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for an initial business combination; we have not, however, selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target.
 
Our sponsor and each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them and our sponsor in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity. We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our sponsor and our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.
 
Lack of Business Diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate a Target’s Management Team
 
Although we will closely scrutinize the management of a prospective business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our founding team, if any, in the business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our founding team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our founding team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular business.

-


We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management, director or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
 
Following an initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates.
 
Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire a business or businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a business. These and other factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
 
Corporate Information
 
Our executive offices are located at 1111 Lincoln Road, Suite 500, Miami Beach, FL 33139 and our telephone number is (786) 750-2820.
 
Employees
 
We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a partner business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process.
 
Reports to security holders
 
We have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, located at http://sec.gov. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year: (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO; (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion; or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which: (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of the prior June 30th; or (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th.
