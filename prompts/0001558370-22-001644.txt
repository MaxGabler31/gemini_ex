Overview
LL Flooring Holdings, Inc. (“LL Flooring” or “Company”) is one of North America’s leading specialty retailers of hard-surface flooring, with 424 stores as of December 31, 2021. Our Company seeks to offer the best customer experience online and in stores, with more than 500 varieties of hard-surface floors featuring a range of quality styles and on-trend designs. Our online tools also help empower customers to find the right solution for the space they’ve envisioned. Our extensive selection includes waterproof vinyl plank, solid and engineered hardwood, laminate, bamboo, porcelain tile, and cork, with a wide range of flooring enhancements and accessories to complement. Our stores are staffed with flooring experts who provide advice, Pro partnership services and installation options for all of our products, the majority of which is in stock and ready for delivery. Our vision is to be the customer’s first choice in hard-surface flooring by providing the best experience, from inspiration to installation. We offer a wide selection of high-quality, stocked products and the accessible flooring expertise and service of a local store, with the scale, omni-channel convenience and value of a national chain. We plan to leverage this advantage to differentiate ourselves in the highly fragmented flooring market. We launched our new digital platform, LLFlooring.com, in December 2020. In February 2021, we launched our new mobile app featuring our popular Picture It! and Floor Finder tools and making it easy to order installations.
​
Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we experienced, as did many retailers, a significant disruption to our business due to COVID-19. We continue to navigate uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment related to COVID-19 global supply chain disruptions, consumer spending, inflation, and a challenging labor market. During the second quarter of 2020 we limited our inventory purchases as a direct result of COVID-19. Supply chain disruption on replenishment kept inventory below our targeted level during the second half of 2020 and all of 2021. As a result, we believe we could have captured more sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the full year 2021 if our inventories had been higher. 
LL Flooring is a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. We were founded in 1994 and our initial public offering was in November 2007. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “LL.” During 2021 we made significant progress in the transition of our brand from Lumber Liquidators to LL Flooring. Effective January 1, 2022 we completed our corporate entity name change from Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc to LL Flooring Holdings, Inc. We operate in a holding company structure with LL Flooring Holdings, Inc. serving as our parent company and certain direct and indirect subsidiaries, including LL Flooring, Inc. and LL Flooring Services, conducting our operations.
Our Business
Market
We operate in a large, growing, highly fragmented hard-surface flooring market in the U.S. Based on internal estimates as well as Catalina Research, Inc.’s Report on Floor Coverings, Annual Market Report 2021, we estimate U.S. hard-surface flooring retail sales (excluding installation labor and non-flooring accessory products) were $31 billion in 2020, an increase of approximately 7% compared to 2019, and total flooring retail sales including soft-surface flooring were approximately $51 billion in 2020, not including installation labor and non-flooring accessory products. Flooring

sales are driven by a number of factors including discretionary income and trends in the housing market. Based on Company estimates and our review of external economic data including existing home sales, the NAHB remodeling index, new housing starts and the U.S. Census, we expect flooring sales to continue to benefit from aging and insufficient housing availability, rising home values and new household formations, among other factors. From 2017 through 2020, we estimate installed sales of hard-surface flooring grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% compared to a negative CAGR for soft-surface flooring. We believe improvements in the quality and construction of certain products, increasing resiliency and water-tolerance of products, ease of installation, availability in a broad range of retail price points, and movement away from soft surfaces will drive continued hard-surface flooring share gain versus soft surface flooring in the future. 
Competition
We compete for customers in a highly fragmented marketplace, where we believe no single retailer has captured more than a 15% share of the consumer market for flooring (including carpet and area rugs) based on internal estimates as well as Catalina Research, Inc.’s Report on Floor Coverings, Annual Market Report 2021. The largest segment of the market is represented by independent specialty retailers comprised of local one-store flooring retailers, small chains of stores that may specialize in one or two flooring categories, and a limited number of regional chains. We also compete against national home improvement warehouse chains, national specialty retailers, warehouse clubs and online retailers. We believe we offer a compelling value proposition to customers as we provide a wide selection of high-quality, stocked products and the accessible flooring expertise and service of a local store, with the scale, omni-channel convenience and value of a national chain. 
Customers
We target several distinct customer groups who each have varied needs with respect to their flooring purchases, including do-it-yourself (“DIY”) customers, installation customers, and Pro customers. We believe that each of the customer groups we serve is passionate about their flooring purchase and values our wide assortment of flooring products, availability, and the quality of those products. While our offering to each of these groups begins with the same broad assortment and knowledgeable store associates, each of these customer groups requires unique service components based on the ability of our associates to share detailed product knowledge and preferred installation methods. We offer customers installation services and also provide dedicated call center resources through our Customer Relationship Center for our DIY and Pro customers. All customer groups are offered delivery services.
Products and Services
Product Selection
We offer an extensive assortment of hard-surface flooring under multiple proprietary brand names, led by our flagships, Bellawood® and Coreluxe®. We launched a new flooring category in the third quarter of 2021, DuravanaTM hybrid resilient flooring, which combines the best characteristics of traditional flooring and the latest technology for waterproofing. Duravana is eco-friendly, 100% PVC free and the MDF core is manufactured from responsibly managed forests as certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. We have invested significant resources developing these national brand names. Our hard-surface flooring products feature a range of quality styles and on-trend designs and are generally differentiated in terms of quality and price based on wood versus manufactured materials, the wood species, grade, and durability of finish. Prefinished floors are the dominant choice for residential customers over unfinished wood planks that have a finish applied after installation. We also offer an assortment of installation services and accessories, including moldings, underlayment, adhesives and tools.
Direct Sourcing
We source directly from flooring and other vendors, which enables us to offer a broad assortment of high-quality proprietary products to our customers at a consistently competitive cost. We seek to establish strong, long-term relationships with our vendors around the world. In doing so, we look for vendors that have demonstrated an ability to meet our demanding specifications, our rigorous compliance standards and the capability to provide sustainable and 

5



growing supplies of high-quality, innovative, trend-right products. We source from both domestic and international vendors, and in 2021, approximately 53% of our product was sourced in North America, 35% was sourced from Asia, 7% was sourced from Europe, and 4% was sourced from South America. In order to reduce our costs, we have been actively moving our products subject to Section 301 tariffs from China into other countries, including North America. 
Supply Chain
Our supply chain is wholly focused on delivering a complete assortment of products to our customers in an efficient manner. We own a one million square foot distribution center on approximately 100 acres of land in Henrico County, Virginia, which serves the stores located in the easternmost two-thirds of the United States. We operate a 500,000 square foot leased distribution center in Pomona, California as the primary distribution center for the stores located in the westernmost one-third of the United States. A number of our vendors maintain certain inventory levels for shipment directly to our stores or our customers. Our product is generally transported boxed and palletized, and the weight of our product is a key driver of our supply chain costs. 
Compliance and Quality Control
Our compliance programs are designed to ensure the products we sell are safe and responsibly sourced, and meet all regulatory and statutory requirements, including, without limitation, requirements associated with the Lacey Act, United States Environment Protection Agency ("EPA") and the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”). We utilize a variety of due diligence processes and controls, including supplier audits, periodic on-site visits, and product testing to ensure such compliance. We utilize a risk-based approach to implement and operate the various aspects of our compliance program. Our compliance program considers, among other things, product risk, the level of vertical integration at our suppliers’ mills, legality concerns noted by both private and government parties, and the results of on-site audits that we perform. Our evaluation of sourcing risk is a key component in our allocation of resources to ensure we meet our standards for product compliance and safety. Compliance and Quality Control teams located in the United States and in China are supplemented with independent third-party resources that provide independent audits and inspections, which are incorporated into our review processes and monitor our sourcing efforts across all areas from which we source product. Compliance programs and functions are continually under review, updated and enhanced as appropriate to stay current with industry, statutory and regulatory requirements. Our Compliance and Regulatory Affairs Committee of the Board of Directors provides oversight of our compliance programs.
Additionally, we maintain and operate a 1,500 square foot lab within our distribution center on the east coast. The lab features two temperature and humidity controlled conditioning rooms and two emission chambers correlated to a CARB- and EPA-approved Third-Party Certifier standard. We believe this equipment mirrors the requirements of CARB, EPA, and capabilities of other state-of-the-art emission testing facilities. This lab, along with our third-party providers, supports our process to ensure compliance with CARB and EPA requirements. We also maintain a lab in Shanghai.
Installation
Almost 12% of our total net revenue in 2021 was from installation sales.   Our customers purchase professional installation services through us to measure and install our flooring at competitive prices. We offer these services at all of our stores. As of December 31, 2021, we utilize a network of associates to perform certain customer-facing, consultative services and coordinate the installation of our flooring products by third-party professional independent contractors. Service revenue for installation transactions that we control along with freight is included in net services sales, with the corresponding costs in cost of services sold. We believe our greater interaction with the customer and strong relationships with the third-party professional independent contractors ultimately results in a better customer experience.
Store Model
As of December 31, 2021, we operated 424 retail stores. We opened 15 new stores and closed one store in 2021. Although we have certain criteria that we require for every store, we are able to adapt a range of existing buildings to our format, including freestanding buildings, strip centers, or small shopping centers. Our stores are typically 6,500 to 

6



7,500 square feet. We enter into short leases, generally for a base term of five to seven years with renewal options, to maximize our real estate flexibility.
We routinely evaluate our store site selection criteria and are currently targeting retail corridors within a market over the more industrial locations we historically sought. We consistently monitor performance of current stores as well as the market opportunity for new locations, adjusting as needed to optimize the profitability and growth potential of our store portfolio. 
Sales Approach
We strive to have an integrated omni-channel sales model that enables our stores, Customer Relationship Center, digital platform, and catalogs to work together in a coordinated manner. We believe that due to the average size of the sale and the general infrequency of a flooring purchase, many of our customers conduct extensive research using multiple channels before making a purchase decision. Though our customers utilize a range of these channels in the decision-making process, the final sale is most often completed in the store, working with our flooring experts. Our DIY and installation customers typically plan well in advance for the inconvenience of removing old flooring and installing new flooring. Our Pros often have larger, more complex projects, and greater lead time and preparation is often required. Our research indicates that the length of a hard-surface flooring purchase can vary significantly from initial interest to final sale.
Our objective is to help the customer through the entire purchase cycle from inspiration to installation, whether in our store or in their home. Our goal is to provide our customers with everything needed to complete their flooring project – to remove the existing floor, install the new floor with complementary moldings and accessories, and finally, maintain the floor.
Our sales strategy emphasizes customer service by providing superior, convenient, educational tools for our customers to learn about our products and the installation process. We invest in training our store team and virtual sales team members on all of our products and install techniques. Flooring samples for most of the products we offer are available in our stores or can be ordered through our digital platform or contact center. Once an order is placed, customers may choose to either have their purchases delivered to their home or job site, or pick them up at a nearby store location.
We are committed to responding to our customers in a timely manner. Our Customer Relationship Center is staffed by flooring experts cross-trained in sales, customer service and product support. In addition to receiving telephone calls, our contact center associates chat online with visitors to our digital platform, respond to emails from our customers and engage in virtual selling. Customers can contact our Customer Relationship Center to place an order, to make an inquiry, or to order a catalog.
Knowledgeable Salespeople
We believe a large segment of residential homeowners are in need of a trusted expert, whether as a guide through a range of flooring alternatives and services or as a resource to both DIY and installation customers. We are deploying robust programs to train our store management and associates to serve our customers at the highest level. This training focuses on selling techniques and in-depth product knowledge for our store associates, who, we believe, are a key driver in a customer’s purchasing decision.
We place an emphasis on identifying, hiring, and empowering associates who share a passion for our business philosophy where possible. Many of our store managers have previous experience with the home improvement, retail flooring or flooring installation industries. We are also adding regional managers and store managers in training to build our future store leadership.

Digital / Omni-Channel
We launched our new digital platform, LLFlooring.com in December 2020. This mobile-friendly site features inspirational content, showcases our flooring in digital room scenes, highlights our digital tools like Picture It!, and Floor Finder and promotes our services such as the ability to order a free installation estimate and flooring samples. Our digital platform contains a broad range of information on our products and services, including a comprehensive knowledge base on all aspects of flooring. Customers can also shop from home with a live sales associate in one of our stores through our virtual shopping experience. We also offer extensive product reviews, before and after photos from previous customer projects, style and design trends via the LL Style blog and how-to installation videos. A customer also has the ability to chat live with a flooring expert, either online or over the phone, regarding questions about a flooring purchase or installation. We continue to develop new features and functionality to assist customers, and to ensure they have robust tools at their disposal that are effective at helping them make the ideal flooring choice as they move between other channels. In April 2021, we launched an e-Commerce experience for our Pro customers, offering online ordering with exclusive Pro pricing and delivery rates on our selection of over 500 floors.
Advertising and Financing 
Advertising: We continue to utilize a mix of digital and traditional media, email and direct mail, to balance product, service and value messaging.   We also leverage our investments in paid, owned and earned media to build brand consideration and to educate customers on the flooring category.  Overall, we proactively manage the mix of our media to ensure we efficiently drive sales while effectively building awareness of our brand value proposition. Our marketing strategy reflects our investment in digital capabilities enabling us to better engage customers with targeted messaging that drives them through the funnel, and we believe this aligns well with shifts in consumer behaviors since the COVID-19 pandemic began. 
We have been transitioning our brand from Lumber Liquidators to LL Flooring. Customers increasingly begin their flooring journey online, and in 2021, we continued to leverage the LL Flooring brand in conjunction with the Lumber Liquidators brand on our website and in marketing materials.  Additionally, during 2021 we made significant progress in the transition of our brand from Lumber Liquidators to LL Flooring. We plan to complete the rebranding of our stores in 2022 as part of our long-term brand evolution, and we continue to be excited about customer feedback from those who experienced the LL Flooring brand as more approachable, relevant and of higher quality.  
Financing: We offer our residential customers a financing alternative through a proprietary credit card, the LL Flooring credit card, underwritten by a third-party financial institution, generally with no recourse to us. This program serves the dual function of providing financial flexibility to our customers and offering us promotional opportunities featuring deferred interest, which we often combine with product promotions. Our customers may also use their LL Flooring credit card for installation services. We also offer our Pro customers a financing alternative, which is underwritten by a third-party financial institution, generally with no recourse to us. The commercial credit program provides our Pro customers a range of additional services that we believe add flexibility to their businesses.
Human Capital Management 
Our people are the core of our business and we commit to deliver them an inclusive, diverse team and culture that understands and adapts to the varying needs of our customers. We seek to provide an engaging work experience that excites and motivates our team members to deliver their best every day. We also aim to provide opportunities for learning and growth, to ensure our team is always the best in the business.
​
We executed on our transformation plan throughout 2021 to mature as a high-touch specialty flooring company and deliver shareholder value. Our transformation plan includes the four strategic pillars of people and culture, improving the customer experience, driving traffic and transactions in our stores and online, and improving profitability. 
​
Our first strategic pillar, people and culture, is a critical driving force behind our transformation plan. Our recent efforts have been focused in three areas: our Company’s culture and training, the safety and health of our associates; and driving diversity and inclusion.

​
Culture and Training
​
Our Company’s vision: to be the customer’s first choice in hard-surface flooring by providing the best experience, from inspiration to installation. We identify the following six guiding values as the foundation of our culture: 
​

● | Be customer obsessed
--+---------------------


● | Embrace diversity
--+------------------


● | Arrive with integrity
--+----------------------


● | Seize opportunities
--+--------------------


● | Be resilient
--+-------------


● | Own our outcomes
--+-----------------

​
In recent years, we added more regional and store managers in training to build our bench of future store leadership. Our field leadership has also focused on developing a more robust store and regional manager training program that promotes both diverse and inclusive leadership as well as driving greater internal career advancement. In 2021, we promoted more than 500 associates and invested substantial hours of training across the organization.
​
Safety and Health 
​
Our commitment to the safety of our associates is an essential and ongoing part of our business. We require careful attention to safety with respect to handling product in our warehouses and stores, as well as during the installation and delivery processes. During COVID-19 we prioritized the safety of our associates and customers and followed rigorous standards for mask wearing, social distance and cleaning protocols. We have mixed remote and in-person work for all corporate support associates including senior management based on local conditions. We have upgraded certain of our ventilation systems and added UV-C sanitizing lights in our conference rooms and break areas. We continue to be judicious about travel and contact to help protect not only our associates but also the communities in which we live. We also provided emergency relief pay to our associates affected by COVID-19 exposure or related facility closures.
 ​
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
​
As part of our transformation, we are driving diversity, equity and inclusion across our Company. This commitment is supported by training and awareness programs as well as focused efforts to recruit, retain, develop and promote a diverse workforce. Our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Taskforce, comprised of a diverse group of associates, is helping to ensure associates can thrive and grow professionally. They continue to share ideas on what diversity, equity and inclusion should look like in our Company. We are also working with external consultants to connect our work with best practices and insights related to diversity, equity and inclusion.
​
Associates
​
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2,400 associates, 97% of whom were full-time and none of whom were represented by a union. Of these associates, 73% work in our stores, 19% work in corporate store support infrastructure or similar functions (including our call center associates) and 8% work in one of our distribution centers. We believe that we have good relations with our associates.
​
Seasonality and Quarterly Results
Our quarterly results of operations can fluctuate depending on the timing of our advertising and the timing of, and income contributed by, our new stores. Our net sales fluctuate slightly as a result of seasonal factors, and we adjust merchandise inventories in anticipation of those factors, causing variations in our build of merchandise inventories. Generally, we experience higher-than-average net sales in the spring and fall, when more home remodeling activities typically are taking place, and lower-than-average net sales in the colder winter months and during the hottest summer months. Our 2020 and 2021 results were impacted by the uncertainty and ongoing impact of the COVID-19

pandemic. In the second quarter of 2020, we experienced, as did many retailers, a significant disruption to our business due to COVID-19. We continue to navigate uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment related to COVID-19, global supply chain disruptions, consumer spending, inflation, and the anniversary of large COVID 19 stimulus payments in both 2020 and 2021. During the second quarter of 2020 we limited our inventory purchases as a direct result of COVID-19. Supply chain disruption on replenishment kept inventory below our targeted level during the second half of 2020 and 2021. As a result, we believe we could have captured more sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2021 if our inventories had been higher. The spread of the COVID-19 Omicron variant also had a negative effect late in 2021 and into 2022.
