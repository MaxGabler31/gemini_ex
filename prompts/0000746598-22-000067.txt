IDS manufactures differentiated, proprietary products, most of which have been internally developed. These internally developed products include materials; printing, identification and tracking systems; and software. IDS competes for business on several factors, including product innovation, customer service, breadth of product offering, product quality, price, expertise, production capabilities, and for multinational customers, our global footprint. Competition is highly fragmented, ranging from smaller companies offering minimal product variety, to some of the world's largest adhesive and electrical product companies offering competing products as part of their overall product lines.
 ID Solutions serves customers in many industries, which include industrial manufacturing, electronic manufacturing, healthcare, chemical, oil, gas, automotive, aerospace, governments, mass transit, electrical contractors, education, leisure and entertainment and telecommunications, among others.
Workplace Safety 
Within the Workplace Safety segment, the primary product categories include:
•Safety and compliance signs, tags, labels, and markings.
•Informational signage and markings.
•Asset tracking labels.
•Facility safety and personal protection equipment.
•First-aid products.
•Labor law and other compliance posters.
Products within the Workplace Safety segment are sold under a variety of brands including: safety and facility identification products offered under the Seton, Emedco, Signals, Safety Signs, SafetyShop, Signs & Labels, and Pervaco brands; first aid supplies under the Accidental Health and Safety, Trafalgar, and Securimed brands; wire identification products marketed under the Carroll brand; and labor law and compliance posters under the Personnel Concepts and Clement Communications brands.
The Workplace Safety segment manufactures a broad range of stock and custom identification products, and also sells a broad range of related resale products. Historically, both the Company and many of our competitors focused their businesses on catalog marketing, often with varying product niches. Many of our competitors extensively utilize e-commerce to promote the sale of their products. A consequence of e-commerce is price transparency, as prices on non-proprietary products can be easily compared. Therefore, to compete effectively, we focus on pricing our products competitively, we continue to build out our e-commerce capabilities, we focus on developing unique or customized solutions, enhancing the customer experience, and providing compliance expertise as these factors are critical to retain existing customers and convert new customers. Workplace Safety primarily sells to businesses and serves many industries, including manufacturers, process industries, government, education, construction, and utilities.
Research and Development
The Company focuses its research and development ("R&D") efforts on track and trace applications, pressure sensitive materials, identification and printing systems, software, and the development of other workplace safety-related products. The Company spent $58.5 million, $44.6 million, and $40.7 million on its R&D activities during the years ended July 31, 2022, 
2021, and 2020, respectively. The majority of R&D spend supports the IDS segment including the recent acquisitions of Code, Magicard, and Nordic ID in fiscal 2021. Material development involves the application of surface chemistry concepts for top coatings and adhesives applied to a variety of base materials. The design of our identification and printing systems integrates materials, embedded software, a variety of printing technologies and product scanning and identification technologies to form a complete solution for customer applications. In addition, the R&D team supports production and marketing efforts by providing application and technical expertise.
The Company owns patents and tradenames relating to certain products in the United States and internationally. Although the Company believes patents are a significant driver in maintaining its position for certain products, technology in the areas covered by many of the patents continues to evolve and may limit the value of such patents. The Company's business is not dependent on any single patent or group of patents. Patents applicable to specific products extend for up to 20 years according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant, depending upon the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The Company's tradenames are generally valid ten years from the date of registration, and are typically renewed on an ongoing basis.
Operations
The materials used in the products manufactured consist of a variety of plastic and synthetic films, paper, metal and metal foil, cloth, fiberglass, inks, dyes, adhesives, pigments, natural and synthetic rubber, organic chemicals, polymers, and solvents for consumable identification products in addition to molded parts, electronic components, chips, and sub-assemblies for identification and printing systems. The Company operates coating facilities that manufacture bulk rolls of label stock for internal and external customers. In addition, the Company purchases finished products for resale.
The Company purchases raw materials, components and finished products from many suppliers. Overall, we are not dependent upon any single supplier for our most critical base materials or components. However, we have chosen in certain situations to sole source, or limit the sources of materials, components, or finished items for design or cost reasons. As a result, disruptions in supply could have an impact on results for a period of time, but we believe any disruptions would simply require qualification of new suppliers and the disruption would be modest. In certain instances, the qualification process could be more costly or take a longer period of time and in certain situations, such as a global shortage of critical materials or components, the financial impact could be material.
The Company carries working capital mainly related to accounts receivable and inventory. Inventory consists of raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Generally, custom products are made to order while an on-hand quantity of stock product is maintained to provide customers with timely delivery. Average time to fulfill customer orders varies from same-day to one month, depending on the type of product, customer request, and whether the product is stock or custom-designed and manufactured. Normal and customary payment terms primarily range from net 10 to 90 days from date of invoice and vary by geography.
The Company has a broad customer base, and no individual customer represents 10% or more of total net sales.
Human Capital Management
As of July 31, 2022, the Company employed approximately 5,700 individuals worldwide, of which approximately 1,650 were employed in the United States and approximately 4,050 were employed outside the United States.
The Company’s Vice President of Human Resources is responsible for developing the Company’s human capital strategy, which includes the attraction, acquisition, development, engagement and retention of talent to deliver on the Company’s strategy as well as the design of employee compensation and benefits programs. Management is responsible for executing the Company's human capital strategy. The Vice President of Human Resources is also responsible for leading the Company’s diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.

The Company utilizes a mixture of leading and lagging indicators to assess the health and safety performance of its operations. Lagging indicators include the OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) and the Lost Time Case Rate (“LTCR”) based upon the 
number of incidents per 100 employees. Leading indicators include reporting and closure of all near miss events. The Company also utilizes trainings such as Environmental, Health and Safety (“EHS”) coaching and engagement conversations as preventative measure.
