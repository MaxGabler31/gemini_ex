Item 1. Business.
Our Business
 
Newpoint Financial Corp., a Delaware corporation (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a holding company that strategically invests primarily in regulated entities such as banks and insurance companies. These investments may be result in us acquiring a controlling or non-controlling interests of these entities. To date, we have entered into three such transactions (one of which has closed): in December 2021 we acquired a 10% interest in Novea, Inc., a financial and insurance services software company; we have also entered into an agreement for the acquisition of an interest in American Millennium Insurance Co., a New Jersey based insurance company (see Item 9b) through purchase of shares of its parent holding companies. Closing is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
 
Since our current investments (one of which has closed) constitute (or will constitute) a minority interest in these companies, we anticipate that our income will be dependent on the ability of these companies to generate revenue and payment of dividends.
