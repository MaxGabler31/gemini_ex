Item 1. | Business

Except where the context indicates otherwise, amounts, numbers, dollars and percentages presented in this Annual Report are rounded and therefore approximate. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report to "Laredo," the "Company," "we," "our," "us," or similar terms refer to Laredo Petroleum, Inc. and its subsidiaries at the applicable time, including former subsidiaries and predecessor companies, as applicable. For a full discussion of the development of our business, see "Part I, Item 1. Business" in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Overview

Laredo Petroleum, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed in 2011, is an independent energy company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties, primarily in the Permian Basin of West Texas. The oil and liquids-rich Permian Basin is characterized by multiple target horizons, extensive production histories, long-lived reserves, high drilling success rates and high initial production rates. As of December 31, 2021, we had assembled 166,064 net acres in the Permian Basin, all of which were held in 398 sections. Our acreage is largely contiguous in the neighboring Texas counties of Borden, Howard, Glasscock, Reagan, Sterling and Irion. We have two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Laredo Midstream Services, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("LMS"), and Garden City Minerals, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("GCM"), and have identified one operating segment: exploration and production.

Business Strategy and 2021 Operational Highlights

Our strategy is to create long-term value through the acquisition of high-margin properties and the efficient development of those properties, combined with prudent balance sheet management and sustainable environmental practices. Beginning in late 2019, we began acquiring oil-weighted properties to the north and west of our existing Permian Basin acreage with the intention of quickly transitioning our development activities to these areas. We have significantly increased our oil production as a percentage of total production and improved our operating margin and, as a result, are on track for sustainable Free Cash Flow generation.
Our extensive operational history in the Permian Basin is a competitive advantage, enabling the efficient integration of acquired properties and attractive rates of return on development capital. Our geologic understanding of the Permian Basin allows us to safely maintain low drilling and completions and operating costs. Efficiencies are further improved by our contiguous acreage base and high working interest, enabling the drilling of longer horizontal wells and operational control of our development plans. Our development plan, driven by data gathered on more than 600 operated horizontal wells, employs conservative well-spacing that seeks to maximize both location count and well productivity. 
In 2021, we made substantial progress executing our strategy, adding approximately 41,000 net acres of oil-weighted, high-margin inventory in Borden, Howard, and Glasscock counties, which are adjacent to our existing acreage in Howard and Glasscock counties. At year-end 2021, we held interests in approximately 66,500 net acres of oil-weighted inventory across such counties and have fully transitioned our development program to the more capital efficient acreage acquired since 2019. During the year, we also divested 37.5%, or approximately 94 million BOE, of our gas-weighted reserves primarily in Reagan and Glasscock counties, using the proceeds to fund a portion of the aforementioned acquisitions. Such moves optimize our capital investments by putting our low-cost structure to work on our oiliest acreage to produce the highest rate of return. With the sustained strength of commodity prices in 2021 and the realization of a long-term positive trend in drilling and completions efficiencies that have helped offset industry-wide service cost inflation, we have maintained a consistent development pace and realized improved expected returns on development capital. 
We proactively manage our financial risks and maintain a strong capital structure. In 2021, we extended the maturity date of our Senior Secured Credit Facility to July 2025 and increased the borrowing base to $1 billion, substantially increasing our liquidity and flexibility. Additionally, we issued $400 million of senior notes maturing in 2029 at interest rates more than two percent lower than our notes due 2028 and used the proceeds to reduce the balance on our credit facility. We have historically hedged our production to protect cash flows, achieve strong rates of return on our capital investments and protect the Company in times of declining commodity prices. We entered 2021 with approximately 78% of our expected oil 
production protected and we will continue to seek hedging opportunities on a multi-year basis to further protect our capital plan, interest payments, and free cash flow generation. 
We integrate best-in-class environmental, social and governance ("ESG") practices into our operations. In 2021, we enhanced our disclosure of key ESG metrics, publishing our inaugural ESG and Climate Risk Report, which covered 2019 operations and was aligned to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures and the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association frameworks. The report announced ambitious emissions reductions targets and outlined goals for reducing both greenhouse gas intensity and methane emissions, as well as eliminating routine flaring by 2025. Additionally, we published our 2021 ESG and Climate Risk Report, which covered 2020 operations, and further expanded our reporting to include industry frameworks provided by the American Petroleum Institute and the American Exploration and Production Council. In our 2021 report, we enhanced our disclosures by including climate-related scenario analysis, Scope 3 emissions estimates, and EEO-1 workforce diversity data. Furthermore, we described our pilot program for continuous emissions monitoring and began efforts to certify portions of our Howard and Glasscock County natural gas production as responsibly sourced through the Project Canary TrustWellTM Certification pilot project. Relatedly, for the second consecutive year, we incorporated environmental measures into our executive compensation program.
Our business strategy is both clear and sustainable. We will continue to focus on safely developing our highest return oil-weighted inventory while opportunistically adding more high-margin acreage as we seek to increase oil as a percentage of our production and improve our margins and profitability by taking advantage of our low-cost structure on more productive acreage. We are highly selective in the projects that we consider, and we will continue to monitor the market for strategic opportunities that we believe could be accretive and enhance shareholder value. These opportunities may take the form of acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, redemptions, equity or debt repurchases, or other similar transactions, any of which could result in the utilization of our Senior Secured Credit Facility and/or further accessing the capital markets.

Operating Areas

We focus our exploration, development and production efforts in one geographic operating area, the Permian Basin.

Well Data

We are currently focusing our development activities on horizontal drilling targets in the Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B and Lower Spraberry formations. Other targets for possible future development include the Upper Spraberry, Middle Spraberry, Wolfcamp C, and Wolfcamp D formations. As of December 31, 2021, we had an average working interest of 70% in Laredo-operated active productive wells and 66% in all wells in which Laredo has an interest, and our leases are 98% held by production. Laredo's working interest in operated active productive wells decreased significantly from previous years as a result of the 37.5% wellbore interest divestiture to an affiliate of Sixth Street Partners, LLC.
The following table sets forth certain information regarding productive wells as of December 31, 2021. Wells are classified as oil or natural gas wells according to the predominant production stream. All but thirteen of our wells are classified as oil wells, all of which also produce liquids-rich natural gas and condensate when in a producing status. We also own royalty and overriding royalty interests in a small number of wells in which we do not own a working interest.

 | Total producing wells | Average WI %
 | Gross | Net | 
 | Vertical | Horizontal | | Total | Total
Permian-Midland Basin: | | | | | 
Operated | 948 | | 696 | | 1,644 | 1,202 | 73 | %

Total | 1,111 | | 806 | | 1,917 | 1,260 | 66 | %


Drilling Activity

On December 31, 2021, we had three drilling rigs drilling horizontal wells and two completions crews. We anticipate releasing one drilling rig and one completions crew by the end of first-quarter 2022 and remaining at two drilling rigs and one completions crew through year-end 2022. We will adjust our drilling rig count and/or completion crews to maximize efficiencies and cash flow. If we decrease our drilling rig count and/or completion crews, it will have a negative impact on our production. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and capital resources" and Note 15.b to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.
The following table summarizes our drilling activity with respect to the number of wells completed and turned-in line for the periods presented. Gross wells reflect the sum of all wells in which we own an interest. Net wells reflect the sum of our working interests in gross wells.

Technology used to establish proved reserves
Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil, NGL and natural gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with "reasonable certainty" to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Reasonable certainty implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil, NGL and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual 
production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, our internal reserve engineers and Ryder Scott, our independent reserve engineers, employed reliable technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability.
Qualifications of technical persons and internal controls over reserves estimation process
In accordance with the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers ("SPE Reserves Auditing Standards") and guidelines established by the SEC, Ryder Scott, our independent reserve engineers, estimated 100% of our proved reserve information as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 included in this Annual Report. The technical persons responsible for preparing the reserve estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the SPE Reserves Auditing Standards.
We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to Ryder Scott in their reserves estimation process. Our technical team meets regularly with representatives of Ryder Scott to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in Ryder Scott's preparation of the year-end reserve estimates. The Ryder Scott reserve report is reviewed with representatives of Ryder Scott and our internal technical staff before dissemination of the information. 
From January through June of 2021, our Vice President of Planning and Business Development was the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates. He had more than 30 years of practical experience, with 30 years of this experience being in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. He held a Bachelors and Masters of Science in Petroleum Engineering from Texas A&M University. From July through December 31, 2021, following the departure of our Vice President of Planning and Business Development, our Director of Reserves became and continues to serve as the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates. She has more than 20 years of practical experience, with 7 years of this experience being in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. She has a Bachelors of Science in Petroleum Engineering from the Missouri University of Science and Technology. Both our former Vice President of Planning and Business Development and our Director of Reserves report to our Chief Financial Officer. Reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our senior engineering staff, other members of senior management and our technical staff, our audit committee and our Chief Executive Officer.
Proved undeveloped reserves
We limit the portion of reserves categorized as "proved undeveloped" or "PUD" in order to emphasize operations on our most economic investments, maximize operational flexibility and maintain conservative assurance that all PUD locations will be converted despite potential commodity price volatility.
Our proved undeveloped reserves increased from 24,642 MBOE as of December 31, 2020 to 86,592 MBOE as of December 31, 2021. We estimate that we incurred $196 million of costs to convert 15,882 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves from 38 locations into proved developed reserves in 2021. New proved undeveloped reserves of 65,621 MBOE were added during the year from (i) 12,645 MBOE from seven Spraberry and 22 new Wolfcamp locations and (ii) 52,976 MBOE from acquisitions in Borden, Howard, and Glasscock counties. 12,210 MBOE of positive revisions consisted of a net (i) 1,700 MBOE of negative revisions due to proved undeveloped locations that were removed due to change in the development plan, (ii) 7,609 MBOE of positive revisions from an increase in previously estimated quantities due to performance and price and (iii) 6,301 MBOE of positive revisions due to the inclusion of twelve undeveloped locations that were removed from reserves in a previous year due to pricing. A final investment decision has been made on all 155 proved undeveloped locations, and they are scheduled to be developed within five years from the date they were initially recorded. 
Estimated total future development and abandonment costs related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves as shown in our December 31, 2021 reserve report are $961.6 million. Based on this report and our PUD booking methodology, the capital estimated to be spent to develop the proved undeveloped reserves from spud date through production is $347.5 million in 2022, $202.2 million in 2023, $205.0 million in 2024, $172.7 million in 2025 and $16.3 million in 2026. Based on our 
anticipated cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as the availability of capital markets transactions, all of the proved undeveloped locations are expected to be drilled and completed from 2022 to 2026. Reserve calculations at any end-of-year period are representative of our development plans at that time. Changes in circumstance, including commodity pricing, oilfield service costs, drilling and production results, technology, acreage position and availability and other economic and regulatory factors may lead to changes in development plans.

Acreage

The following table sets forth our developed and undeveloped acreage as of December 31, 2021, including acreage HBP. A majority of our developed acreage is subject to liens securing our Senior Secured Credit Facility.

 | Developed acres | Undeveloped acres | | Total acres | %HBP 
 | Gross | Net | | Gross | Net | Gross | | Net
Permian-Midland Basin | 198,783 | | 163,128 | | 4,384 | | 2,936 | | 203,167 | 166,064 | 98 | %

The following table sets forth our gross and net undeveloped acreage as of December 31, 2021 that will expire over the next four years unless production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage or the lease is renewed, renegotiated or extended under continuous drilling provisions prior to the primary term expiration dates.

 | Years ended December 31,
 | 2022 | 2023 | | 2024 | 2025
 | Gross | Net | | Gross | Net | Gross | | Net | Gross | Net
Permian-Midland Basin | 1,519 | | 1,048 | | 374 | | 414 | | 1,026 | | 979 | — | —

Of the total undeveloped acreage identified as potentially expiring over the next five years as of December 31, 2021, 2,355 net acres have associated PUD reserves included in our reserve report as of December 31, 2021, which we anticipate drilling to hold or renewing the associated leases. These PUD reserves represent 1% of our total PUD reserves as of December 31, 2021.
Of the total undeveloped acreage identified as potentially expiring over the next three years as of December 31, 2020, 3,642 net acres had associated PUD reserves included in our reserve report as of December 31, 2020. Of the total undeveloped acreage potentially expiring in 2021, 261 net acres were not retained through lease renewals or operations.

Marketing

We market the majority of production from properties we operate for both our account and the account of the other working interest owners. We sell substantially all of our production under contracts ranging from terms of one month to multiple years, all at monthly calculated market prices. We typically sell production to a relatively limited number of customers, as is customary in the exploration, development and production business; however, we believe that our customer diversification affords us optionality in our sales destination. 
We are committed to deliver, for sale or transportation, fixed volumes of product under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. The following table presents our material firm sale and transportation commitments as of December 31, 2021:

 | Total | 2022 | | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 and after
Crude oil (MBbl): | | | | | | 
Sales commitments | 10,470 | | 8,660 | | 1,810 | | — | — 
Transportation commitments: | | | | | | 
Field | 32,880 | | 10,950 | | 10,950 | | 10,980 | — 
To U.S. Gulf Coast | 67,960 | | 13,675 | | 12,775 | | 12,810 | 28,700
Natural gas (MMcf): | | | | | | 
Sales commitments | 69,188 | | 15,466 | | 11,300 | | 8,332 | 34,090
Total commitments (MBOE)(1) | 122,841 | | 35,863 | | 27,418 | | 25,179 | 34,382

_____________________________________________________________________________
(1)BOE is calculated using a conversion rate of six Mcf per one Bbl.
We have firm field transportation agreements that enable us or the purchasers of our oil production to move oil from our production area to major market hubs, including Colorado City, Texas; Midland, Texas; and Crane, Texas. If not fulfilled, we are subject to firm transportation payments on excess pipeline capacity and other contractual penalties. These commitments are normal and customary for our business. A portion of our commitments are related to transportation commitments extending into 2024 with Medallion Pipeline Company, LLC ("Medallion") under which Medallion provides firm transportation capacity from our established Reagan County and Glasscock County acreage for redelivery to various major market hubs. We also have a firm transportation agreement with BridgeTex Pipeline Company, LLC to move oil from Colorado City, Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast. In 2018, we signed an agreement with Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC to initially transport 25,000 barrels of oil per day increasing to 35,000 barrels of oil per day of our production from Crane, Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Our shipments under this contract began in the fourth quarter of 2019. We believe these commitments enhance our ability to move our crude oil out of the Permian Basin and give us access to multiple pricing points for the sale of our crude oil. 
We have committed to deliver, for sale or transportation, fixed volumes of product under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. See Note 15.c to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of our transportation commitments.
We believe that we could sell our production to numerous companies, so that the loss of any one of our major purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations solely by reason of such loss. For discussion on purchasers that individually accounted for 10% or more of each (i) oil, NGL and natural gas sales and (ii) sales of purchased oil in at least one of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. See also "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—The inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us may materially adversely affect our financial results."

Title to properties

We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards. As is customary in the industry, in the case of undeveloped properties, often cursory investigation of record title is made at the time of lease acquisition. Investigations are made before the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. Individual properties may be subject to burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect the value of the properties. Burdens on properties may include customary royalty interests, liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes, obligations or duties under applicable laws, development obligations under oil and gas leases or net profit interests.
The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil, NGL and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises. The lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 12.5% to 25%, resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 75% to 87.5%. 

Seasonality

Demand for oil and natural gas generally decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the summer and winter months. However, seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or mild summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. These seasonal anomalies can increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay our operations.

Regulation of the oil and natural gas industry

Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, the production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The State of Texas has regulations governing environmental and conservation matters, including provisions for the pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the permitting of allocation wells, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells (including the proration of production to the market demand for oil, NGL and natural gas), the regulation of well spacing, the handling and disposal or discharge of waste materials and plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil, NGL and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, Texas imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, NGL and natural gas within its jurisdiction. Texas further regulates drilling and operating activities by, among other things, requiring permits and bonds for the drilling and operation of wells and regulating the location of wells, method of drilling and casing wells, surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and plugging and abandonment of wells. The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the natural gas industry are regularly considered by the current administration, Congress, the states, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective, under the current or any future administration. 

Oil and gas pipelines

Our oil and gas pipelines are subject to construction, installation, operation and safety regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT") and various other federal, state and local agencies. Congress has enacted several pipeline safety acts over the years. Currently, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") under DOT administers pipeline safety requirements for natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. These regulations, among other things, address pipeline integrity management and pipeline operator qualification rules. In June 2016, Congress approved new pipeline safety legislation, the "Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016", which provides the PHMSA with additional authority to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquids pipeline facilities. On October 1, 2019, the PHMSA published final rules to expand its integrity management requirements and impose new pressure testing requirements on regulated pipelines, including certain segments outside high consequence areas. The rules, once effective, also extend reporting requirements to certain previously unregulated hazardous liquid gravity and rural gathering lines. Also, on November 15, 2021, the PHMSA published a final rule extending reporting requirements to all onshore gas gathering operators and establishing a set of minimum safety requirements for certain gas gathering pipelines with large diameters and high operating pressures. Additional rulemakings are anticipated, including rulemakings to adjust repair criteria for gas transmission lines, to require inspection of gas pipelines following extreme events, and to strengthen integrity management assessment requirements. Also, on June 7, 2021, the PHMSA issued an advisory bulletin reminding pipeline owners and operators that, pursuant to legislation signed into law in December 2020, they must take several steps to eliminate hazardous leaks and minimize releases of natural gas by December 27, 2021. These requirements could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in 
our incurring increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial position. In addition, any material penalties or fines issued to us under these or other statutes, rules, regulations or orders could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flow. 
States are largely pre-empted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety but may assume responsibility for enforcing intrastate pipeline regulations at least as stringent as the federal standards, and many states have undertaken responsibility to enforce the federal standards. The RRC is the agency vested with intrastate natural gas pipeline regulatory and enforcement authority in Texas. The Commission's regulations adopt by reference the minimum federal safety standards for the transportation of natural gas. In addition, on December 17, 2019, the Commission adopted rules requiring that operators of gathering lines take "appropriate" actions to fix safety hazards. 

Environmental and occupational health and safety matters

Our operations are subject to numerous stringent federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or occupational health and safety. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the EPA, issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures, the noncompliance with which carries substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations to remediate noncompliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, production and transporting through pipelines, govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling, completion and production process, limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, frontier, seismically active areas and other protected areas, require some form of remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from current or former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations or failure to comply with regulatory filings. In addition, these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of production. 
Certain of these laws and regulations impose strict liability (i.e., no showing of "fault" is required) that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several. Public interest in the protection of the environment has tended to increase over time. The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the oil and natural gas industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating, waste handling, disposal and clean-up requirements, our business and prospects, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general, could be materially adversely affected.

Hazardous substance and waste handling

Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, solid and hazardous wastes, and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict and, in some cases, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (referred to as "CERCLA" or the "Superfund law") and comparable state laws, impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons deemed "responsible parties." These persons include current owners or operators of the site where a release of hazardous substances occurred, prior owners or operators that owned or operated the site at the time of the release or disposal of hazardous substances, and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons. Despite the "petroleum exclusion" of Section 101(14) of CERCLA, which currently encompasses natural gas, we may nonetheless handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the 
environment. In addition, we may have liability for releases of hazardous substances at our properties by prior owners or operators or other third parties. Finally, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file common law based claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment.
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the "OPA") is the primary federal law imposing oil spill liability. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the United States, including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs. Under the OPA, strict, joint and several liability may be imposed on "responsible parties" for all containment and clean-up costs and certain other damages arising from a release, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters and natural resource damages, resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. A "responsible party" includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility. The OPA establishes a liability limit for onshore facilities, but these liability limits may not apply if: a spill is caused by a party's gross negligence or willful misconduct; the spill resulted from a violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation; or a party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up. We are also subject to analogous state statutes that impose liabilities with respect to oil spills. 
We also generate solid wastes, including hazardous wastes, which are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable state statutes. Although RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Certain petroleum production wastes are excluded from RCRA's hazardous waste regulations. These wastes, instead, are regulated under RCRA's less stringent solid waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. It is also possible that these wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, will be designated as "hazardous wastes" in the future and, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes as "hazardous wastes." Also, in December 2016, the EPA agreed in a consent decree to review its regulation of oil and gas waste. However, in April 2019, the EPA concluded that revisions to the federal regulations for the management of oil and gas waste are not necessary at this time. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses.

Water and other waste discharges and spills

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA"), the OPA and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas wastes, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. The discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, is also prohibited, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps"). 
The scope of waters regulated under the CWA has fluctuated in recent years. On June 29, 2015, the EPA and the Corps jointly promulgated final rules redefining the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act. However, on October 22, 2019, the agencies repealed the 2015 rules, and on April 21, 2020, the EPA and the Corps published a final rule replacing the 2015 rules, and significantly reduced the waters subject to federal regulation under the Clean Water Act. On August 30, 2021, a federal court struck down the replacement rule and on December 7, 2021, the EPA and the Corps published a proposed rule that would put back into place the pre-2015 definition of “waters of the United States,” updated to reflect Supreme Court decisions, while the agencies continue to consult with stakeholders on future regulatory actions. As a result of such recent developments, substantial uncertainty exists regarding the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act. To the extent the rules expand the range of properties subject to the Clean Water Act's jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. 
The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. The State of Texas also maintains groundwater protection 
programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. The underground injection of fluids is subject to permitting and other requirements under state laws and regulation. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. These same regulatory programs also limit the total volume of water that can be discharged, hence limiting the rate of development, and require us to incur compliance costs. 
These laws and any implementing regulations provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other substances and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and the underground injection of fluids and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as "SPCC plans," in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. 

Hydraulic fracturing

We use hydraulic fracturing as a means to maximize the productivity of almost every well that we drill and complete. Hydraulic fracturing is a necessary part of the completion process for our producing properties in Texas because our properties are dependent upon our ability to effectively fracture the producing formations in order to produce at economic rates. While hydraulic fracturing is not required to maintain any of our leasehold acreage that is currently held by production from existing wells, it will be required in the future to develop the provided non-producing and proved undeveloped reserves associated with this acreage. Nearly all of our proved undeveloped reserves associated with future completion, recompletion and refracture stimulation projects require hydraulic fracturing. 
Hydraulic fracturing is a practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We have and continue to follow standard industry practices and applicable legal requirements. These protective measures include setting surface casing at a depth sufficient to protect fresh water formations and cementing the well to create a permanent isolating barrier between the casing pipe and surrounding geological formations. This well design is intended to eliminate a pathway for the fracturing fluid to contact any aquifers. For recompletions of existing wells, the production casing is pressure tested prior to perforating the new completion interval. Injections rates and pressures are monitored in real time at the surface during our hydraulic fracturing operations. Pressure is monitored on both the injection string and the immediate annulus to the injection string. Our hydraulic fracturing operations are designed to be shut down immediately if an abrupt change occurred to the injection pressure or annular pressure. 
Approximately 99% of the hydraulic fracturing fluids we use are made up of water and sand. The remainder of the constituents in the fracturing fluid are managed and used in accordance with applicable requirements. In accordance with Texas regulations, we report the constituents of the hydraulic fracturing fluids utilized in our well completions on FracFocus (www.fracfocus.org). Hydraulic fracture stimulation requires the use of a significant volume of water. Upon flowback of the water, we dispose of it by recycling or by discharging into the approved disposal wells. We currently do not discharge water to the surface. Based upon results of testing the performance of recycled flowback/produced water in our fracking operations, we endeavor to maximize the utilization of recycled flowback/produced water via our owned and operated recycling facilities in Glasscock and Reagan County or via contractual arrangements with third parties in Howard County. 
The SDWA regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control Program (the "UIC"). However, hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the UIC, and thus the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. Nevertheless, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the UIC. On February 12, 2014, the EPA published a revised UIC Program permitting guidance for oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing activities using diesel fuel. The guidance document describes how Class II regulations may be tailored to address the purported unique risks of diesel fuel injection during the hydraulic fracturing process. Although the EPA is not the permitting authority for UIC Class II programs in Texas, where we maintain acreage, the EPA is encouraging state programs to review and consider use of this permit guidance. Furthermore, legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of Congress to repeal the hydraulic fracturing exemption from the SDWA, provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and require public disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. 
In addition, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The EPA is also conducting a 
study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment, or CWT, facilities) accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities. We cannot predict the impact that these actions may have on our business at this time, but further regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
Also, on March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (the "BLM") published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, implementation of a casing and cementing program, management of recovered fluids, and submission to the BLM of detailed information about the proposed operation, including wellbore geology, the location of faults and fractures, and the depths of all usable water. On March 28, 2017, the Trump Administration issued an executive order directing the BLM to review the rule, and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise it. Accordingly, on December 29, 2017, the BLM published a final rule to rescind the 2015 hydraulic fracturing rule; however, a coalition of environmentalists, tribal advocates and the State of California filed lawsuits challenging the rule rescission. At this time, it is uncertain when, or if, the hydraulic fracturing rule will be implemented, and what impact it would have on our operations.
Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either under way or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanism.
Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose additional requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities or otherwise require the public disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, pursuant to legislation adopted by the State of Texas in June 2011, beginning February 1, 2012, companies were required to disclose to the RRC and the public the chemical components used in the hydraulic fracturing process, as well as the volume of water used. Also, in May 2013, the RRC adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. The new rules took effect in January 2014. Additionally, on October 28, 2014, the RRC adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, among other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed, new disposal well. The disposal well rule amendments, which became effective on November 17, 2014, also clarify the RRC's authority to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. The RRC has used this authority to deny permits and temporarily suspend operations for waste disposal wells and, in September 2021, the RRC curtailed the amount of water companies were permitted to inject into some wells near Midland and Odessa in the Permian Basin and has since indefinitely suspended some permits there and expanded the restrictions to other areas. These restrictions on the disposal of produced water could result in increased operating costs, forcing us or our service providers to truck produced water, recycle it or pump it through the pipeline network or other means, all of which could be costly. In addition, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular.
A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country alleging that hydraulic fracturing practices have induced seismic activity and adversely impacted drinking water supplies, use of surface water, and the environment generally. Several states and municipalities have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. If these or any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to drill and produce from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, fracturing activities could become subject to additional 
permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. These developments, as well as new laws or regulations, could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business that may arise if federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing is enacted into law.

Air quality

The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including production facilities, salt water disposal facilities, and compressor stations, through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources and emissions from specific sources such as tanks, engines, dehydration units, and heaters. Also, on June 3, 2016, the EPA published a final rule regarding the criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule clarified the term “adjacent” and defined when sources are required to be aggregated. The consequences of these requirements are that smaller sites may need to be combined, triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements. Current air permitting regulations require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of projects or facilities expected to produce or increase air emissions. Once obtained these air permits require compliance with strict and stringent requirements and utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain air permits and emission control equipment prior to construction requires timely planning to ensure that the development of oil and natural gas projects is not delayed.
In August 2012, the EPA published New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, and storage operations. The rules include NSPS for completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells and establish specific new requirements for emissions from compressors, pneumatic controllers, dehydrators, storage vessels, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. This rule was promulgated and implemented to reduce emissions from volatile organic compounds ("VOC"). On June 3, 2016 the EPA published additional standards for methane and VOC emissions for certain new, modified, and reconstructed equipment, processes, and activities across the oil and natural gas sector, including Leak Detection and Repair ("LDAR") programs, emission controls for tanks, verification of closed vent systems, and compressor requirements. Regulation of oil and natural gas facilities continues to expand and become more rigorous. Most recently, on November 15, 2021, the EPA published a proposed rule for oil and natural gas facilities that will expand control requirements, increase LDAR inspection frequencies, prohibit venting of natural gas in certain situations, require equipment retrofits, and regulate older facilities.
In addition, on November 18, 2016, the BLM finalized a waste prevention rule to reduce the flaring, venting and leaking of methane from oil and gas operations on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires operators to use currently available technologies and equipment to reduce flaring, periodically inspect their operations for leaks, and replace outdated equipment that vents large quantities of gas into the air. The rule also clarifies when operators owe the government royalties for flared gas. On March 28, 2017, the Trump Administration issued an executive order directing the BLM to review the above rule and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise it. On September 28, 2018, the BLM finalized revisions to the waste prevention rule to reduce "unnecessary compliance burdens." However, a federal court struck down the scaled-back rule on July 15, 2020, and shortly thereafter, on October 8, 2020, another federal court struck down the 2016 waste prevention rule. At this time, it is uncertain when, and to what extent, the waste prevention rule will be implemented, and what impact it will have on our operations.
The above standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions and impose stringent air permit requirements. These regulations also mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to minimize, eliminate, or control emissions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions.
We have incurred additional capital expenditures to ensure compliance with these new regulations as they come into effect. We may also be required to incur additional capital expenditures in the next few years for air pollution control equipment in connection with complying with new air regulations, maintaining or obtaining operating permits addressing other air emission 
related issues, which may have a material adverse effect on our operations and has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. 

"Greenhouse gas" emissions

In recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ("GHGs"). The EPA has finalized a series of GHG monitoring, reporting and emission control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions. Almost one-half of the states have already taken measures to reduce GHG emissions primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. Also, states have imposed increasingly stringent requirements related to the venting or flaring of gas during oil and gas operations. In addition, some states have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources.
At the international level, in December 2015, the United States participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake "ambitious efforts" to limit the average global temperature and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Paris Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016. Although the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement, effective November 4, 2020, President Biden issued an Executive Order on January 20, 2021 to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which took effect on February 19, 2021. On April 21, 2021, the United States announced that it was setting an economy-wide target of reducing its GHG emissions by 50-52 percent below 2005 levels in 2030. In November 2021, in connection with the 26th Conference of the Parties in Glasgow, Scotland, the United States and other world leaders made further commitments to reduce GHGs, including reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030. Relatedly, many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to support the international climate commitments. 
Restrictions on GHG emissions that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil, NGL and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities, operations and ability to access capital. Furthermore, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury, property damages or other liabilities. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.

Occupational Safety and Health Act

Certain of our operations are subject to applicable requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended ("OSHA") and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA's hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that certain information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. 

National Environmental Policy Act

Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Departments of Interior and Agriculture, to evaluate major agency 
actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency prepares an environmental assessment to evaluate the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project. If impacts are considered significant, the agency will prepare a more detailed environmental impact study that is made available for public review and comment. Any exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands would require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This environmental impact assessment process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA also are subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which can delay or halt projects.

Endangered Species Act

The Endangered Species Act ("ESA") was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species or its habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development. If previously unprotected species, such as the dunes sagebrush lizard, are designated as endangered or threatened, or if we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas, which could adversely impact the value of our leases.

Summary

We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental federal, state and local laws and regulations and that we hold all necessary, valid and up-to-date permits, registrations and other authorizations required under such laws and regulations or are in the process of obtaining such items. However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen incidents may occur or past non-compliance with laws or regulations may be discovered, and such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impacts of compliance. Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements and believe that the current costs of compliance are appropriately reflected in our budget, there is no assurance that this will continue.

Regulation of derivatives

The July 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") provides for federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the "CFTC"), the SEC, and federal regulators of financial institutions (the "Prudential Regulators") adopt rules or regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act and providing definitions of terms used in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain market participants and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail or cease their derivatives activities.
The CFTC, the SEC and the Prudential Regulators have issued many rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act, including rules (the "Adopted Derivatives Rules") (i) requiring clearing of hedges, or swaps, that are subject to the Dodd-Frank Act (currently, only certain interest rate and credit default swaps, which we do not presently have (the "Mandatory Clearing Rule"), and also establishing an "end user" exception to the Mandatory Clearing Rule (the "End User Exception"), (ii) setting forth collateral requirements in connection with swaps that are not cleared (the "Margin Rule") and also an exception to the Margin Rule for end users that are not financial end users (the "Non-Financial End User Exception") and (iii) imposing position limits on certain futures contracts, including the NYMEX "Henry Hub" gas contract and "Light Sweet Crude" oil contract, and economically equivalent swaps (the "Position Limit Rule"). The Position Limit Rule took effect March 15, 2021 and the position limits, other than those for economically equivalent swaps provided for in the Position Limit Rule, took effect on January 1, 2022; the position limits for economically equivalent swaps will take effect on January 1, 2023. The Position Limit Rule provides an exemption from the position limits for swaps that constitute "bona fide hedging positions" within the definition of such term 
under the Position Limit Rule, subject to the party claiming the exemption complying with the applicable filing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the Position Limit Rule. 
We qualify for the End User Exception and will utilize it if the Mandatory Clearing Rule is expanded to cover swaps in which we participate, we qualify for the Non-Financial End User Exception and will not be required to post margin in connection with uncleared swaps under the Margin Rule, and our existing and anticipated hedging positions constitute "bona fide hedging positions" under the Position Limit Rule, and we intend to undertake the filing, recordkeeping and reporting necessary to utilize the bona fide hedging position exemption under the Position Limit Rule, so we do not expect to be directly affected by any such rules. However, most if not all of our hedge counterparties will be subject to mandatory clearing in connection with their hedging activities with parties who do not qualify for the End User Exception and will be required to post margin in connection with their hedging activities with other swap dealers, major swap participants, financial end users and other persons that do not qualify for the Non-Financial End User Exception. In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations (including laws and regulations giving the European Union financial authorities the power to write down amounts we may be owed on hedging agreements with counterparties subject to such laws and regulations and/or require that we accept equity interests in such counterparties in lieu of cash in satisfaction of such amounts, collectively the "Foreign Regulations"), which may apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such Foreign Regulations (the "Foreign Counterparties") and the U.S. adopted law and rules (the "U.S. Resolution Stay Rules") clarifying similar rights of U.S. banking authorities with respect to banking institutions subject to their regulation.
