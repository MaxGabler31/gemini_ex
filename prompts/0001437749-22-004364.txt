ITEM 1 | BUSINESS
-------+---------

Overview
 
Cable One, Inc. (“Cable One,” “us,” “our,” “we” or the “Company”) is a fully integrated provider of data, video and voice services to residential and business customers in 24 Western, Midwestern and Southern states as of December 31, 2021. The markets we serve are primarily non-metropolitan, secondary and tertiary markets, with approximately 74% of our customers located in seven states as of December 31, 2021: Arizona, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas. Our biggest customer concentrations are in the Mississippi Gulf Coast region and in the greater Boise, Idaho region. We provided service to approximately 1.2 million residential and business customers out of approximately 2.7 million homes passed as of December 31, 2021. Of these customers, approximately 1,055,000 subscribed to data services, 261,000 subscribed to video services and 149,000 subscribed to voice services as of December 31, 2021.
 
We generate substantially all of our revenues through three primary product lines. Ranked by share of our total revenues during 2021, they are residential data (52.0%), residential video (21.2%) and business services (data, voice and video: 19.2%). The profit margins, growth rates and/or capital intensity of these three primary product lines vary significantly due to competition, product maturity and relative costs.
 
In 2021, our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) margins for residential data and business services were approximately nine and eleven times greater, respectively, than for residential video. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin for a product line as Adjusted EBITDA attributable to that product line divided by revenue attributable to that product line (see the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Use of Adjusted EBITDA” for the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, which is the most directly comparable measure under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”)). This margin disparity is largely the result of significant programming costs and retransmission fees incurred to deliver residential video services, which in each of the last three years represented between 64% and 66% of total residential video revenues. Neither of our other primary product lines has direct costs representing as substantial a portion of revenues as programming costs and retransmission fees represent for residential video, and indirect costs are generally allocated on a per primary service unit (“PSU”) basis.
 
We focus on growing our higher margin businesses, namely residential data and business services. Beginning in 2013, we began our shift away from our prior concentration on growing revenues through subscriber retention and maximizing customer PSUs. We adapted our strategy to face the industry-wide trends of declining profitability of residential video services and declining revenues from residential voice services. The declining profitability of residential video services is due primarily to increasing programming costs and retransmission fees and competition from other content providers, and the declining revenues from residential voice services are due primarily to the increasing use of wireless voice services instead of residential voice services. Separately, we have also focused on retaining customers who are likely to produce higher relative value over the life of their service relationships with us, are less attracted by discounting, require less support and churn less. This strategy focuses on increasing Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures and producing higher margins.
 
Excluding the effects of our recently completed and any potential future acquisitions and divestitures, the trends described above and the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted, and are expected to further impact, our three primary product lines in the following ways:
 

● | Residential data. We have experienced growth in residential data customers and revenues every year since 2013, and that growth accelerated in 2020 and 2021, in part as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and our associated responses discussed within the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — COVID-19 Update.” We expect growth for this product line to continue over the long-term as we believe upgrades in our broadband capacity, our ability to offer higher access speeds than many of our competitors, the reliability and flexibility of our data service offerings and our Wi-Fi support service will enable us to continue to grow average monthly revenue per unit ("ARPU") from our existing customers and capture additional market share from both data subscribers who use other providers as well as households in our footprint that do not yet subscribe to data services from any provider.

● | Residential video. Residential video service is an increasingly costly and fragmenting business, with programming costs and retransmission fees continuing to escalate in the face of a proliferation of streaming content alternatives. We intend to continue our strategy of focusing on the higher-margin businesses of residential data and business services while de-emphasizing our residential video business. As a result of our video strategy, we expect that residential video customers and revenues will decline further in the future. In 2021, we began the launch of Sparklight® TV, an internet protocol-based (“IPTV”) video service that allows customers with our Sparklight TV app to stream our video channels from the cloud. Currently, over 90% of our homes passed have access to Sparklight TV, and we expect to complete this offering in all non-Hargray markets by early 2022. This transition from linear to IPTV video service will enable us to reclaim spectrum, freeing up network capacity to increase data speeds and capacity across our network.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Business services. We have experienced significant growth in business data customers and revenues, and we expect this growth to continue over the long-term. We attribute this growth to our strategic focus on increasing sales to business customers and our efforts to attract enterprise business customers. Margins for products sold to business customers have remained attractive, which we expect will continue.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We continue to experience increased competition, particularly from telephone companies, fiber and municipal overbuilders, over-the-top (“OTT”) video providers and direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) television providers. Because of the levels of competition we face, we believe it is important to make investments in our infrastructure. In addition, a key objective of our capital allocation process is to invest in initiatives designed to drive revenue and Adjusted EBITDA expansion. More than 60% of our total capital expenditures since 2017 were focused on infrastructure improvements intended to grow these measures. We continue to invest capital to, among other things, increase fiber density and coverage, expand our footprint, increase plant and data capacity, enhance network reliability and improve the customer experience. As of December 31, 2021, we offered Gigabit data service to approximately 99% of our homes passed and have deployed DOCSIS 3.1, which, together with Sparklight TV, further increases our network capacity and enables future growth in our residential data and business services product lines.
 
We expect to continue to devote financial resources to infrastructure improvements in existing and newly acquired markets as well as to expand high-speed data service in areas where our consortium was designated the winning bidder for the Federal Communications Commission’s (“FCC”) Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (“RDOF”) Phase I auction. We believe these investments are necessary to continually meet our customers’ needs and to remain competitive. The capital enhancements associated with recent acquisitions include rebuilding low-capacity markets; reclaiming bandwidth from analog video services; implementing 32-channel bonding; deploying DOCSIS 4.0; consolidating back office functions such as billing, accounting and service provisioning; migrating products to legacy Cable One platforms; and expanding our high-capacity fiber network. The term “legacy Cable One” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to Cable One operations inclusive of operations acquired in the RBI Holding LLC (“NewWave”) transaction and excluding the impact or operations acquired in the Delta Communications, L.L.C. (“Clearwave”), Fidelity Communications Co. (“Fidelity”), Valu-Net LLC (“Valu-Net”), Hargray and Cable America Missouri, LLC ("CableAmerica") transactions, each of which is described below.
 
Our primary goals are to continue growing residential data and business services revenues, to increase profit margins and to deliver strong Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures. To achieve these goals, we intend to continue our disciplined cost management approach, remain focused on customers with expected higher relative value and follow through with further planned investments in broadband plant upgrades, including the deployment of DOCSIS 4.0 capabilities and new data service offerings for residential and business customers. At the same time, we intend to continue balancing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, associates, customers and other stakeholders. We also plan to continue seeking broadband-related acquisition and strategic investment opportunities in rural markets in addition to pursuing organic growth through market expansion projects.
 
Our business is subject to extensive governmental regulation, which substantially impacts our operational and administrative expenses. In addition, we could be significantly impacted by changes to the existing regulatory framework, whether triggered by legislative, administrative or judicial rulings. Congress and numerous states, including Minnesota and Missouri (where we have subscribers), have proposed legislation and/or administrative actions that would lead to increased regulation of our provision of data services, including proposed rules regarding net neutrality. Several states, including Oregon and Washington (where we also have subscribers), have adopted legislation that requires entities providing broadband internet access service in the state to comply with net neutrality requirements or that prohibits state and local government agencies from contracting with internet service providers that engage in certain network management activities based on paid prioritization, content blocking or other discrimination. We cannot predict whether or when any future changes to the regulatory framework will occur at the Federal or state level or whether or to what extent those changes may affect our operations or impose additional costs on our business.
 
We serve our customers through a plant and network with capacity generally measuring 750 megahertz or higher and have DOCSIS 3.1 capabilities in our systems. Our technically advanced infrastructure provides for delivery of a full suite of data, video and voice products. Our broadband plant generally consists of a fiber-to-the-premises or hybrid fiber-coaxial (“HFC”) network with ample unused capacity, and nearly all of our customers experience download speeds of 100 Megabits per second (“Mbps”) or higher, which meaningfully distinguishes our offerings from competitors in most of our markets. As a result of multi-year investments in our legacy Cable One plant, we increased broadband capacity and reliability, which has enabled and will continue to enable us to offer even higher download speeds to our customers. In addition, we expect to begin DOCSIS 4.0 upgrades in late 2022 which will enable symmetrical Gigabit speeds. These upgrades will allow us to further increase plant capacity in support of ongoing increases in consumer demand. We believe these investments will reinforce our competitive strength in this area.

Corporate History
 
In 1986, The Washington Post Company (the prior name of our former corporate parent, Graham Holdings Company (“GHC”)) acquired 53 cable television systems with approximately 350,000 subscribers in 15 Western, Midwestern and Southern states. We completed over 30 acquisitions and dispositions of cable systems through 2015, both through cash sales and system trades. In the process, we substantially reshaped our original geographic footprint and resized our typical system, including exiting a number of metropolitan markets and acquiring cable systems in non-metropolitan markets that fit our business model. On July 1, 2015, we became an independent company traded under the ticker symbol “CABO” on the New York Stock Exchange after completion of our spin-off from GHC.
 
Our recent business acquisitions include:
 

● | On May 1, 2017, we acquired NewWave, a provider of data, video and voice services to residential and business customers throughout non-urban areas of Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas, for a purchase price of $740.2 million.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On January 8, 2019, we acquired Clearwave, a facilities-based service provider that owns and operates a high-capacity fiber network offering dense regional coverage in Southern Illinois, for a purchase price of $358.8 million. On January 1, 2022, a majority of Clearwave's operations were contributed to the Clearwave Fiber joint venture discussed below.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On October 1, 2019, we acquired the data, video and voice business and certain related assets of Fidelity, a provider of connectivity services to residential and business customers throughout Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas, for a purchase price of $531.4 million.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On July 1, 2020, we acquired Valu-Net, an all-fiber internet service provider headquartered in Kansas, for a purchase price of $38.9 million.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On May 3, 2021, we acquired the remaining approximately 85% equity interest that we did not already own in Hargray, a data, video and voice services provider to residential and business customers throughout Alabama, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, for a purchase price of approximately $2.0 billion that implied a $2.2 billion total enterprise value for Hargray on a cash-free and debt-free basis. The Hargray Acquisition was financed with cash on hand and net proceeds from indebtedness. The Hargray Acquisition expands our presence in the Southeastern U.S. and we expect to capitalize on Hargray’s experience and expertise in fiber expansion.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On December 30, 2021, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from CableAmerica, a data, video and voice services provider in central Missouri, for $113.1 million in cash on a debt-free basis, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The CableAmerica acquisition was financed with cash on hand and is expected to provide the Company opportunities for footprint expansion in Missouri, margin growth and potential cost synergy realization.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In 2020, we completed the rebranding of our legacy Cable One consumer-facing business to Sparklight. The Sparklight brand better conveys who we are and what we stand for – a company committed to providing our communities with connectivity that enriches their world. As part of the rebranding, we began streamlining our residential internet service plans and pricing as well as offering even faster speeds, further value and the ability to include unlimited data on any plan. In addition, we have strengthened and will continue to strengthen our commitment to the communities we serve through educational programs, corporate giving and donations of time and resources. Acquired operations are generally transitioned to Sparklight branding within three years of acquisition.
 
In recent years we made investments in several broadband-centric providers serving non-urban markets that follow various strategies similar to our own. Our recent strategic investments include:
 

● | On May 4, 2020, we made a minority equity investment for a less than 10% ownership interest in AMG Technology Investment Group, LLC, a wireless internet service provider (“Nextlink”), for $27.2 million. On November 5, 2021, we invested an additional $50.0 million in Nextlink, resulting in us owning an approximately 17% equity interest in Nextlink.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On July 10, 2020, we acquired an approximately 40% minority equity interest in Wisper ISP, LLC, a wireless internet service provider (“Wisper”), for total consideration of $25.3 million.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On October 1, 2020, we contributed the assets of our Anniston, Alabama system (the “Anniston System”) to Hargray in exchange for an approximately 15% equity interest, on a fully diluted basis, in Hargray, a data, video and voice services provider (the “Anniston Exchange”). The Anniston System had approximately 19,000 residential data subscribers at the time of the transaction. As discussed above, we acquired the remaining approximately 85% equity interest in Hargray on May 3, 2021.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On November 12, 2020, we acquired a 45% minority equity interest in Mega Broadband Investments Holdings LLC, a data, video and voice services provider (“MBI”), for $574.9 million in cash.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On October 1, 2021, we made a minority equity investment for a less than 10% ownership interest in Point Broadband Holdings, LLC, a fiber internet service provider ("Point Broadband"), for $25.0 million.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On October 18, 2021, we completed a minority equity investment for a less than 10% ownership interest in Tristar Acquisition I Corp, a special-purpose acquisition company ("Tristar"), for $20.8 million.

Industry Overview
 
We are a fully integrated provider of data, video and voice services to residential and business customers across various geographic regions in the United States. We provide services that are similar to those provided by cable companies, telephone companies and fiber providers, among others. These providers, each to a varying degree, own and/or lease a network that allows them to deliver their services and distribute their signals to the homes and businesses of subscribers. In addition to building their own network backbone and/or leasing physical access to the network backbone, companies providing video services also purchase licenses to provide their subscribers with access to television channels owned by programmers and broadcasters via distribution over the network backbone. Companies providing video services also typically sell advertising on their video channels.
 
These providers generate revenue by charging subscription fees to their residential and business customers at rates that vary according to the data, video and/or voice services for which customers subscribe and the type of internet access and equipment furnished to them. These companies generally market and sell their services in bundles or packages in order to maximize the number of PSUs per household, as they believe it is desirable to sell multiple products jointly so that the fixed costs per customer can be spread over multiple PSUs. These providers generally operate in their chosen geographic markets under either non-exclusive franchises or other telecommunications licenses granted by state or local authorities for specified periods of time.
 
We have a record of consistent, long-term financial and operational success driven by our differentiated operating philosophy and culture. We emphasize focus as opposed to scale, which is a departure from the historical, more conventional strategies employed in our industry, but is well suited to the markets in which we operate and enables us to take advantage of our strengths.
 
Our Strengths
 
We leverage a variety of strengths as a service provider, stemming from, among other things, historical and ongoing capital investments in our plant and our focus on serving customers in non-metropolitan markets. These strengths include the following:
 
Attractive markets and regional diversification. Our customers are located primarily in non-metropolitan, secondary and tertiary markets with favorable competitive dynamics in comparison to major urban centers. In particular:
 

● | We tend to face less vigorous competition than similar service providers in metropolitan markets at this time.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advances in technology often come later to our markets — for example, few competitors in our markets offer fiber-to-the-premises or "5G" wireless service.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our subscribers tend to be value-focused, enabling us to save video services costs by not carrying expensive programming options with low subscriber demand.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We are regionally diversified, reducing the impact that an economic downturn in a specific geographic area would have on our overall business.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Deep customer understanding. We have operated as a non-metropolitan service provider for over 25 years, and we are attuned to the unique needs of customers in these areas. In order to understand our customers’ demands and preferences, we routinely conduct customer research through a variety of methods, including customer satisfaction surveys, geo-demographic segmentation studies and other analytics. Together with the direct customer contact we engage in through our virtual call centers and local operating offices, we believe we have gained valuable insight into how to serve customers in non-metropolitan markets, including with respect to providing an optimal mix of data speeds, price points and best-in-class customer service levels. In addition, a majority of our employees (who we refer to as associates) reside and work in our markets, providing local services through education programs and donations of time and resources that enhance our commitment to the communities we serve.
 
    6 

  

Superior broadband technology with ample unused capacity. We offer our residential and business data customers internet products at faster speeds than those available from competitors in most of our markets. Our broadband plant generally consists of a fiber-to-the-premises or HFC network with ample unused capacity. Our starter broadband offering for residential customers is a download speed of 100 Mbps, which is at the faster end of the range for similar residential offerings in our markets, although a growing majority of our customers now subscribe to even higher speed offerings. Our fastest broadband offering for our residential customers is currently a download speed of up to 1 Gigabit per second (“Gbps”). We also offer an advanced Wi-Fi solution to residential customers across substantially all of our footprint that provides customers with enhanced Wi-Fi signal strength, which extends and improves the Wi-Fi signal throughout the home. This service is offered free of charge to residential customers who rent one or more modems from us.
 
In addition, we have made significant investments in our business consistent with our strategic focus to enhance sales of residential data services and business services. Since completing significant, multi-year plant and product enhancements in existing Cable One markets in 2017, we have continued to make ongoing investments in our acquired systems, which has increased our broadband capacity and reliability. We have invested nearly $950 million over the last three years to bring fast, reliable high-speed data service to our markets. We expect to continue to invest in strategic capital projects, including around newly acquired operations and market expansions, because we believe the competitive benefits will be significant, particularly for data services. We also made the following capital investments in 2021:
 

● | We continued to decrease the average number of data customers per unique service group by aggressively splitting service areas (fiber nodes), which substantially improves data throughput during periods of peak usage, minimizing disruptions in data access speeds to our customers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We continued to invest in plant upgrade projects, which have enhanced reliability and allowed us to stay ahead of the consumption curve related to broadband capacity and utilization, and plant extension projects, which have expanded the number of serviceable homes and businesses.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We continued to deploy 10 Gbps-capable fiber-to-the-premises technology for both residential and business customers across multiple markets, placing fiber deeper into the network and closer to the customer.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We anticipate that the projects we have invested in over the last several years will facilitate sustained increases in residential data and business services revenues and customer satisfaction.
 
Low cost structure and competitive pricing. We believe our operating costs, taken as a whole, are as low as or lower than any major service provider. We attribute our low-cost structure to a committed focus on retaining our highest value customers (rather than seeking to obtain as many customers as possible) and the lower costs of operating in non-metropolitan markets compared to metropolitan markets. In addition, because we operate our residential and business data services with a competitive plant and cost structure, we are able to offer our customers both attractive pricing and compelling products.
 
Customer satisfaction. We have a customer-focused approach, influencing how we are organized, how we sell our services and how we service our customers. We believe that our dedication to providing a differentiated customer experience is an important driver of our overall value proposition and creates loyalty, improves customer retention and drives increased demand for our services. We focus on customer satisfaction, with an emphasis on consistently benchmarking our customer satisfaction over time and relative to our competitors based on internally and externally generated customer satisfaction data. We continue to focus on making the lives of our customers easier by providing value-added services, such as expanding customer self-service options through improved residential and business online portals and creating a more personalized experience in updated and refreshed local offices.
 
Associate satisfaction. We have also focused on associate satisfaction. We believe our customers’ satisfaction is tightly linked to our associates’ satisfaction, which has been consistently high throughout the past decade based on routine internal measurements. We currently measure our associate satisfaction annually along with conducting multiple periodic associate surveys.
 
Experienced management team. Our senior management team is comprised of executives who have significant experience in our industry. Our executive officers have an average industry tenure of over 20 years and an average tenure at Cable One (or its predecessors) of approximately 10 years, and we believe this team is deeply knowledgeable about cost and competitive conditions in our markets. They also understand and are deeply committed to our strategy, which we developed, enhanced and updated on a collaborative basis over many years.

Our Strategy
 
We have a multi-faceted strategy that builds upon our long track record of focusing on the right markets, the right products and the right customers, as well as controlling our operating and capital costs. More specifically, our strategy includes the following principal components:
 
Focus on non-metropolitan markets. We believe our decision over two decades ago to concentrate on non-metropolitan markets has served us well, and we intend to continue to focus on offering our products primarily in these markets. The economics of non-metropolitan markets, for which we have optimized our strategy and our operations, are different from operations in major cities and have yielded positive operating results for our business. Because price points for services in non-metropolitan markets are generally lower, and customers in non-metropolitan markets tend to subscribe to fewer PSUs, our average revenue per customer and our PSUs per customer are lower than they might be in metropolitan markets. However, many of our costs are also lower than they would be in metropolitan markets. The dynamics of non-metropolitan markets enable us to operate at attractive margins and earn substantial returns, while remaining consistent with our focus on meeting customer demand for low prices and simultaneously keeping costs down. In addition, we tend to face less vigorous competition than service providers in metropolitan markets.
 
Prioritize higher growth, higher margin opportunities. We concentrate on the products and customers that maximize Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures and provide the best opportunity for profitable growth. We believe residential video and residential voice face inexorable long-term declines. With respect to the video product, programmers and broadcasters are charging higher rates and retransmission fees for content to distributors providing video services (often for content for which viewership is declining), and distributors have had to choose between absorbing those increases to the detriment of their margins or passing on the full cost to customers, which adversely affects customer demand. At the same time, the rapid expansion of OTT offerings has given customers new alternatives to traditional video offerings. In addition, customer demand for wireless voice services has reduced demand for residential voice services for us and others in our industry. As a result, we have reduced our focus on these two products and prioritized higher growth, higher margin opportunities in residential data and business services.
 
We have declined to cross-subsidize our video business with cash flow from our higher growth, higher margin products, which has resulted in our residential video customers declining at a faster rate than the industry average. Our legacy Cable One residential video customers decreased by 18.2% when comparing 2021 versus 2020 and 25.2% when comparing 2020 versus 2019. While this strategy runs contrary to the historical, conventional wisdom in our industry, which put heavy emphasis on video customer counts and maximizing the number of PSUs per customer by bundling and discounting services, we believe it best positions us for long-term success. For us, success in growing and retaining residential data and business customers is far more important than maximizing the number of customers who choose triple-play packages combining data, video and voice services.
 
Drive growth in residential data and business services. We believe our residential data and business services products provide attractive current and future growth opportunities. Our disciplined prioritization of residential data and business services is generally reflected in all aspects of our business strategy, including pricing, the allocation of sales, marketing and customer service resources, capital spending and supplier negotiations. During 2021, we continued to further diversify our revenue streams away from video as residential data and business services represented 71.3% of our total revenues versus 68.2% for 2020 and 64.4% for 2019. We believe we have demonstrated that it is possible to decouple unit growth in our residential data and residential video businesses, which historically were marketed as a package. We focus on selling data-only packages to new customers rather than cross-selling video services to these customers, and a majority of our residential customers are data-only.
 
Our business services revenues increased $74.1 million, or 31.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. Approximately $60.0 million of this increase is attributable to eight months of incremental revenues from Hargray operations after the Hargray Acquisition on May 3, 2021. We expect to generate continued growth in business services by leveraging and investing in our existing infrastructure capabilities and footprint to offer higher broadband speeds, more choice and greater value than other providers in our markets and to expand our business services to attract more small, medium-sized and enterprise business customers.

Continue our culture of cost leadership. We believe our total combined operating and capital costs per customer over the past decade have been among the lowest of any service provider with publicly reported numbers and that our operating margins compare very favorably with those of significantly bigger companies in our industry. This is the antithesis of normal economies-of-scale expectations, where higher volumes are expected to create lower costs per customer and increase operating margins. Rather than increasing our size and seeking cost savings through economies-of-scale, we have achieved our lower cost structure over many years by focusing on:
 

● | serving primarily non-metropolitan, secondary and tertiary markets, which contain different customer dynamics from those in metropolitan markets and would require us to implement additional operational components;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the adoption of new technologies only after they have been tested by other companies, rather than incurring the level of capital expenditures and risk necessary to be an early adopter of most new technologies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | implementing a virtually centralized call center to receive inbound customer service calls and dispatch technicians across all of our markets, while keeping the majority of our call center associates in our non-metropolitan markets;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | standardizing our programming offerings across most of our markets, which reduces our customer service costs, in contrast to other service providers that offer different programming packages in different markets;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | focusing on retaining and seeking expected higher relative value customers rather than trying to maximize the number of customers or PSUs per customer;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | aligning our resources to emphasize increased sales of residential data services and sales to business customers and continuing our disciplined cost management approach, rather than committing resources equally to sales of all of our products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | investing in self-service channels to improve customer satisfaction by allowing us to meet changing customer expectations for around-the-clock service while also avoiding unnecessary wait times; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | implementation of digital transformation initiatives that include automation and customer self-service within our processes, which enables us to better allocate resources to more value-added activities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe our strategy has produced positive results for our customers, associates and stockholders and we have begun applying this strategy in our acquired operations. Our strategy has allowed us to continually decrease customer service phone calls and truck rolls. We have been able to achieve these operational efficiencies at the same time as our customer base has grown rapidly, while simultaneously maintaining customer satisfaction scores.
 
Balanced capital allocation. We are committed to a disciplined approach to evaluating acquisitions, internal and external investments, capital structure optimization and return of capital in order to seek to build long-term stockholder value.
 
Target higher relative value residential customers. We employ rigorous analytics to gain a deeper understanding of our customers and drive profitable decision making throughout the organization. We use data analytics to help refine our go-to-market strategy and identify customers likely to produce higher relative value over the life of their service relationships with us, rather than seeking to maximize the number of new customers or PSUs per household. Our investments in business intelligence have enabled us to integrate, analyze and visualize increasingly complex data sets, in near real-time, and in a format that drives strategic and operational decisions. As a result, our organization has more rapidly identified, modeled, tested, analyzed and implemented initiatives that align with our strategic focus of attracting and retaining higher relative value customers. Business intelligence also enables us to be more predictive with customer habits and industrywide trends. For example, our decision to focus on data-only customers was guided by such data analytics. We believe that optimizing our relationships with these customers, as video and voice cord-cutting accelerates, is both a necessity and an opportunity for our business.
 
Our Products
 
Residential Data Services
 
Residential data services represented 52.0%, 50.5% and 46.9% of our total revenues for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As part of our rebranding initiative beginning in 2019, we continued to evolve our pricing and packaging across the majority of our footprint to create more value for customers. We offer simplified data plans with lower pricing and higher speeds across our premium tiers, with download speeds up to 1 Gbps available to approximately 99% of our residential customers as of December 31, 2021. We also offer our customers the option to purchase an unlimited data plan regardless of speed tier. Further, to meet the increasing bandwidth needs of our customers who use a growing number of devices in the home, we offer most of our customers our advanced Wi-Fi service combining state-of-the-art technology solutions with certified technicians, who locate and configure hardware based on individual customer needs. This service provides customers with enhanced Wi-Fi signal strength, which extends and improves the Wi-Fi signal throughout the home.

Residential Video Services
 
Residential video services represented 21.2%, 25.1% and 28.7% of our total revenues for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We offer a broad variety of residential video services, generally ranging from a basic video service to a full digital service with access to hundreds of channels. Currently, over 90% of our homes passed have access to Sparklight TV, an IPTV video service that allows customers to stream our video channels from the cloud through a new app on supported devices, such as the Amazon Firestick, Apple TV and Android-based smart televisions. We expect to complete this offering in all non-Hargray markets by early 2022. Sparklight TV also provides a cloud-based DVR feature and it does not require the use of a set-top box. 
Business Services
 
We consider the data, voice and video products we provide to our business customers to be a separate product from our residential versions of these services. Business services represented 19.2%, 17.7% and 17.5% of our total revenues for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We offer services for businesses ranging in size from small to mid-market, in addition to enterprise, wholesale and carrier customers.
 
Our offerings for small businesses are generally provided over our coaxial network. Our data services offer various options with download speeds ranging from 25 Mbps up to 1 Gbps, with varying upload speeds, along with managed Wi-Fi. Our small business voice solutions include hosted voice with unified communications as a service from one line to multi-line options, including the availability of popular calling features like simultaneous ring, hunt groups and selective call forwarding. Business video packages range from a basic service tier to a comprehensive selection including variety, news and sports programming in high-definition.
 
We offer delivery of data and voice services using fiber-to-the-premises technology primarily for mid-market customers. This shared fiber architecture provides for symmetrical data speeds ranging from 50 Mbps to 5 Gbps. We expect to expand this technology to additional areas and markets each year for the foreseeable future, especially in our competitive locations.
 
For enterprise and wholesale customers, we offer dedicated bandwidth and Enterprise Wi-Fi in addition to multiple voice services via fiber optic technology. Our fiber optic-based products include dark fiber in addition to dedicated internet access and E-Line, E-Lan and E-Access Ethernet services. We also offer network to network interface connections to other carriers at multiple points of presence across the United States.
 
Residential Voice Services
 
Residential voice services represented 3.0%, 3.6% and 3.7% of our total revenues for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The majority of our residential voice service offerings transmit digital voice signals over our network and are interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) services. We also offer traditional telecommunications services through some of our subsidiaries.

Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive, subscriber-driven and rapidly changing industry and compete with a growing number of entities that provide a broad range of communications products, services and content to subscribers. Our competitors have historically included, and we expect will continue to include, DBS providers, telephone companies that offer data and video services through digital subscriber line (“DSL”) technology or fiber-to-the-node networks, municipalities with fiber-based networks, regional fiber providers and other service providers that have been granted a franchise to operate in a geographic market in which we are already operating.
 
In approximately 71% of our footprint, we do not have a competitor that offers residential broadband download speeds of 100 Mbps or higher, which is our starter residential high-speed data offering. Currently, approximately 18% of the residential homes passed in our markets have access to fiber-to-the-premises from our competitors who typically offer only high-speed data service. Higher overall competition rates in 2021 were due primarily to the impact of acquired operations and improved tracking capabilities as opposed to significant overbuilder activity. We also face increasing competition from wireless telephone companies for our residential voice services, as our customers continue to replace our residential voice services with wireless voice services. New entrants with significant financial resources may compete on a larger scale with our video and data services, and as more wireless voice service providers offer unlimited data options, some customers may choose to forgo our data services altogether. We may also face increasing competition from various providers of wireless internet offerings, including wireless telephone carriers that are deploying high-speed “5G” wireless networks and public locations or commercial establishments offering Wi-Fi at no cost.
 
Certain municipalities have also announced plans to construct their own data networks with access speeds that match or exceed ours through the use of fiber-to-the-node or fiber-to-the-premises technology. In some cases, local government entities and municipal utilities may legally compete with us without obtaining a franchise from a state or local governmental franchising authority (“LFA”), reducing their barriers to entry into our markets. The entrance of municipalities as competitors in our markets would add to the competition we face and could lead to some customer attrition.
 
While not an area of strategic focus for us, our video business also faces substantial and increasing competition from other forms of in-home and mobile entertainment, including, among others, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, Paramount+, Peacock, YouTube TV and an increasing number of new entrants who offer OTT video programming, including many traditional programmers. Because of the significant size and financial resources of many of the companies behind such service offerings, we anticipate that they will continue to invest resources in increasing the availability of video content over the internet, which may result in less demand for the video services we provide. Despite the negative impact this competition has on our video business, these services also generate additional demand for our residential data business due to customers’ continuing and growing need for data services.
 
Competition for dedicated fiber-optic services for enterprise business customers is also intense as both local telephone companies and regional overbuilders offer data and voice services over dedicated fiber connections. While certain of these entities are currently more widely known for dedicated fiber services than we are, we maintain a competitive advantage through our local presence and deep customer relationships in the communities we serve.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
Associate Metrics
 
At December 31, 2021, we had 3,628 full-time and part-time associates, compared to 2,716 full-time and part-time associates at December 31, 2020. None of our associates were represented by a union at December 31, 2021 or 2020. Women represented approximately 30% of our total associate base and approximately 35% of management-level positions at December 31, 2021.
 
Associate Engagement, Retention and Compensation Programs and Benefits
 
We believe our associates are among our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. We strive to attract, develop, motivate and retain associates with an emphasis on performance and productivity. We seek to maintain alignment, foster accountability and encourage long-term focus throughout all levels of the Company. Our average associate tenure at Cable One (or its predecessors) is nearly 10 years.
 
Our senior management team is comprised of executives who have significant experience in our industry. They also understand and are deeply committed to our strategy, which we developed, enhanced and updated on a collaborative basis over many years. Our executive officers have an average industry tenure of over 20 years and an average tenure at Cable One (or its predecessors) of approximately 10 years, and we believe this team is deeply knowledgeable about cost and competitive conditions in our markets.
 
    11 

  

Our total rewards compensation philosophy encompasses pay, health benefits, incentives, wellness and career development options. Our pay-for-performance philosophy permeates our organization. Merit increases are based on individual performance and market conditions, and all associates are eligible for an annual bonus based on objective corporate performance goals shared by everyone in the Company.
 
We also focus on associate satisfaction. We believe that customer satisfaction is tightly linked to associate satisfaction, which routine internal measurements have shown to be consistently high throughout the past decade. We currently measure our associate satisfaction annually along with conducting multiple periodic associate surveys. Management reviews our associate satisfaction surveys to monitor associate morale and receive feedback on a variety of issues.
 
Talent Development and Training
 
We believe in investing in the development and careers of our associates to allow them to reach their potential in a competitive, constantly changing and innovative industry. We engage our associates through internal and external programs to develop specialized knowledge and leadership skills. Associates have access to online development programs for professional skills and certification preparation through our e-learning platform. Specialized technical training for eligible associates helps them professionally as well as by providing a differentiated customer experience. Our tuition reimbursement program enables associates to earn certificates in areas such as network programming, data analysis and network administration and security. Others leverage our educational benefits to earn their associates, bachelor’s and master’s degrees.
 
To prepare non-executives for current and future leadership roles at our Company, new managers, supervisors and lead-level associates normally attend a one-week training at our corporate headquarters to focus on self-awareness and management development. Our director-level associates participate in a week-long leadership training program with a third-party development partner, focused on effectiveness training and coaching. Our senior director-level associates take part in a specialized leadership program conducted with both in-house and third-party human resources executives to develop and enhance skills in strategic thinking and team performance, which includes individual coaching and 360-degree feedback analysis. While held virtually in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope to resume these programs in-person in 2022.
 
We have a long track record of promoting associates from within, including Julia M. Laulis, our Chair of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, who has been with Cable One for more than 20 years and began her career at Cable One as a Director of Marketing.
 
Health and Safety
 
We have a Safety Team that is responsible for education and training and that regularly analyzes indicators and areas where risks and injuries can occur in our efforts to strive to eliminate hazards. We also have mandatory compliance and safety training for associates, with more than 20,000 instructional hours completed in these areas in 2021.
 
Beginning in 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety protocols and new procedures to protect our associates and our customers. These protocols include complying with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. In addition, we modified the way we conduct many aspects of our business to reduce the number of in-person interactions. For example, we significantly expanded the use of virtual interactions in all aspects of our business, including customer facing activities. Many of our administrative and operational functions during this time have required modification as well, including many of our associates working remotely. For a detailed discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our human capital resources, refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors — The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our operations and adversely affected our business, financial results and financial condition, and the duration and extent to which it will continue to do so is uncertain and difficult to predict.”
 
Diversity, Equality and Inclusion
 
We are an equal opportunity employer that strives to provide an inclusive and respectful environment that represents a wide range of backgrounds, cultures and experiences. We are committed to fostering an environment in which all associates and customers are valued. We foster a diverse and inclusive culture by offering competitive compensation, a comprehensive rewards program and opportunities for all of our associates to grow personally and professionally. In 2020, we established an Inclusion and Diversity Advisory Board (the “I&D Advisory Board”) made up of individuals from across the organization and ranging from frontline associates to members of management. The I&D Advisory Board was created to further strengthen a culture of respect and inclusion at Cable One. It cultivates resources, internal communications and events to inform, educate and provide all associates with a voice to share their unique experiences, perspectives and viewpoints.

Regulation and Legislation
 
General
 
Our data, video and voice operations are subject to various requirements imposed by U.S. Federal, state and local governmental authorities. The regulation of certain cable rates pursuant to procedures established by Congress has negatively affected our revenues. Certain other legislative, regulatory and judicial matters discussed in this section also have the potential to adversely affect our data, video and voice businesses. The following discussion does not purport to be a complete summary of all the provisions of Federal, state and local law that may affect our operations. Proposals for additional or revised regulations and requirements are pending before Congress, state legislatures and Federal and state regulatory agencies. We generally cannot predict whether new legislation or regulations, court action or a change in the extent of application or enforcement of current laws and regulations would have an adverse impact on our operations.
Broadband Internet Access Services

Broadband internet access service, which we currently offer in all our systems, is subject to some regulation at the Federal level and is not subject to state or local government regulation at this time, except for the state net neutrality laws discussed below.
Regulatory Reclassification and Net Neutrality Regulation. In 2017, the FCC adopted the Restoring Internet Freedom Order (the “Internet Freedom Order”), which reinstated broadband internet access service as an “information service” under Title I of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”). The Internet Freedom Order rescinded the majority of the open internet rules adopted by the FCC in 2015 in the Open Internet Order, with the exception of enhanced disclosure requirements that require broadband internet access service providers to disclose information regarding network management, performance and commercial terms of the service to their customers. In October 2020, the FCC reaffirmed its previous findings about the Internet Freedom Order after certain issues were remanded to it by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In July 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy that encouraged the FCC to consider adopting net neutrality rules similar to those originally adopted in 2015. Numerous parties also have urged the FCC to take action regarding net neutrality. Any action by the FCC likely would be subject to further judicial review.
 
Congress and numerous states, including Minnesota and Missouri (where we have subscribers), have proposed legislation and/or administrative actions that would lead to increased regulation of our provision of data services, including proposed rules regarding net neutrality. Several states, including Oregon and Washington (where we also have subscribers), have adopted legislation that requires entities providing broadband internet access service in the state to comply with net neutrality requirements or that prohibits state and local government agencies from contracting with internet service providers that engage in certain network management activities based on paid prioritization, content blocking or other discrimination. Net neutrality obligations could cause us to incur additional compliance costs, and the enforcement or interpretation of these new obligations could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict whether or when any future changes to the regulatory framework will occur at the Federal or state level or whether or to what extent those changes may affect our operations or impose additional costs on our business.
 
Disclosure and Non-Discrimination Requirements. As stated above, the FCC’s current rules require broadband internet access service providers to disclose certain information regarding network management, performance and commercial terms of the service to their customers. As part of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Congress ordered the FCC to conduct a rulemaking to consider imposing additional consumer disclosure requirements on broadband internet access service providers using “broadband labels.”  In addition, the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act requires the FCC to adopt rules to facilitate equal access to broadband internet access service and prevent digital discrimination of access, including the development of model policies and best practices, and a process to accept public complaints relating to digital discrimination. Compliance with these new obligations could cause us to incur additional compliance costs, and the enforcement or interpretation of these new obligations could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict whether or to what extent these changes may affect our operations or impose additional costs on our business.
 
Emergency Broadband Benefit and Affordable Connectivity Programs. In 2021, we participated in the FCC’s Emergency Broadband Benefit (“EBB”) program, which provided qualifying low-income consumers a discount on certain of our broadband internet access services for which we received reimbursement from the FCC. On December 31, 2021, the EBB program transitioned to the Affordable Connectivity Program (“ACP”) as required by the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The ACP operates in largely the same manner as the EBB program and allows us to seek reimbursement for certain broadband internet access service discounts provided to qualifying low-income consumers. We are subject to various compliance obligations in connection with our participation in the EBB program and the ACP, which may cause us to incur additional compliance costs. We cannot predict whether or when any future changes to the ACP may occur, or whether or to what extent those changes may affect our operations or impose additional costs on our business.
Privacy. Broadband internet access service is subject to many of the same Federal and state privacy laws that apply to other electronic communications. These include the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which addresses interceptions of electronic communications that are in transit; the Stored Communications Act, which addresses acquisitions of electronic data in storage; and other Federal and state privacy laws and regulations. As the collection and use of consumer data becomes more prevalent in the communications industry, our compliance obligations may grow. In 2017, the FCC reinstated its previous rules applicable to customer proprietary network information (“CPNI”) for voice services. In addition, privacy legislation has been proposed at the Federal and state level, some of which would require broadband service providers to apply heightened privacy and security protections to customer data. We cannot predict whether, when or to what extent these obligations may impose costs on our business.
 
    15 

  

In addition to FCC privacy regulations governing broadband internet access service, the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) also may exercise authority over privacy by using its existing authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices to apply greater restrictions on the collection and use of personally identifiable and other information relating to consumers. The FTC also has undertaken numerous enforcement actions against parties that do not provide sufficient security protections against the loss or unauthorized disclosure of this type of information. We also are subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements that apply to website operators and online services directed to children under 13 years of age, or that knowingly collect or post personal information from children under 13 years of age. Other privacy oriented laws have been extended by courts to online video providers and are increasingly being used in privacy lawsuits, including class actions, against providers of video materials online. We cannot predict whether, when or to what extent these obligations may impose costs on our business.
 
We are also subject to Federal and state laws and regulations regarding data security that primarily apply to sensitive personal information that could be used to commit identity theft. Most states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed due to a security breach, and the FCC has adopted security breach rules for voice services. Several states have also enacted general data security requirements to safeguard consumer information, including the proper disposal of consumer information. We cannot predict whether, when or to what extent these obligations may impose costs on our business.
 
Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Owners of copyrights and trademarks actively seek to prevent use of the internet to violate their rights. For example, copyright and trademark owners assert claims that a customer used an internet service or resources accessed via the internet to post, download or disseminate copyrighted music, movies, software or other content without the consent of the copyright owner. In some cases, copyright and trademark owners have sought to recover damages from the broadband internet access service provider as well as or instead of the customer. The law relating to the potential liability of broadband internet access service providers in these circumstances is unsettled. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act grants broadband internet access service providers protection against certain claims of copyright infringement resulting from the actions of customers if the internet provider complies with certain requirements. Congress has not adopted similar immunity for broadband internet access service providers for trademark infringement claims.
Business Data Services. The FCC has adopted a deregulatory framework for Business Data Services (“BDS”), formerly known as “special access” services. These services provide dedicated point-to-point transmission of data at certain guaranteed speeds and service levels using high-capacity connections. The framework eliminated pricing regulation for certain types of BDS and established a competitive market test for determining whether other types of BDS should remain subject to pricing regulation. In July 2019, the FCC reaffirmed its decision regarding the framework and provided a transition period for further deregulation of BDS provided by incumbent carriers. At this time, we cannot predict how these or any future rule changes will affect our business.
Video Services
 
Title VI of the Communications Act establishes the principal Federal regulatory framework for our operation of cable systems and for the provision of our video services. The Communications Act allocates primary responsibility for enforcing the Federal policies among the FCC and state and local governmental authorities.
Franchising. We are required to obtain franchises or authorizations from state or local governmental authorities to operate our cable systems. Those franchises typically are non-exclusive and limited in time, contain various conditions and limitations and provide for the payment of fees to the local authority, determined generally as a percentage of revenues. Federal law restricts franchise fee payments to 5% of the gross revenues of a cable system that are derived from the provision of video services. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of a franchise may give rise to rights of termination by the franchising authority.
 
A number of states in which we operate have adopted franchising laws that provide for statewide franchising. Generally, statewide cable franchises are issued for a fixed term, reduce many burdensome requirements contained in traditional local cable franchises and eliminate the need for local oversight and negotiation. Various other state and local statutes, ordinances and administrative laws additionally govern our operation in particular communities.
 
Prior to the scheduled expiration of our franchises, we generally initiate renewal proceedings with the granting authorities. Federal law provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which local authorities may not unreasonably withhold franchise renewals. In connection with the franchise renewal process, however, many local governmental authorities require the cable operator to make additional commitments.
 
    16 

  

In August 2019, the FCC issued an order that limits the scope of demands that state and local authorities may require in exchange for issuing or renewing a franchise. The FCC’s order clarified that state and local franchising authorities are prohibited from using their video franchising authority to regulate the provision of non-cable services, including broadband, Wi-Fi and VoIP services that are delivered over “mixed use” systems that offer a variety of services. The FCC also held that non-monetary in-kind contributions required by a franchising authority count as franchise fees subject to the 5% cap on such fees. The majority of the FCC’s order was upheld by the Sixth Circuit on appeal, and the state and local franchising authorities currently are seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court. We cannot predict the outcome of the court appeals and whether or to what extent the rules as revised by the FCC or the courts may affect our operations or impose costs on our business.
 
The FCC has adopted rules designed to expedite the process of awarding competitive franchises and relieving applicants for competing franchises of some locally imposed franchise obligations. These rules are especially beneficial to new entrants and are expected to continue to accelerate the competition we are experiencing in the video service marketplace.
 
Rate Regulation. FCC regulations prohibit LFAs or the FCC from regulating the rates that cable systems charge for certain levels of video service, equipment and service calls when those cable systems are subject to “effective competition.” The FCC’s rate regulations contain a presumption that all cable systems are subject to the effective-competition exemption unless proven otherwise.
Carriage of Local Television Broadcast Stations. There are two alternative legal methods for carriage of local broadcast television stations on cable systems. Federal “must carry” regulations require cable systems to carry local broadcast television stations upon the request of the local broadcaster. As a result, certain of our cable systems must carry broadcast stations that we might not otherwise have elected to carry.
 
Alternatively, Federal law includes “retransmission consent” regulations, by which broadcasters can elect to prohibit cable carriage unless the cable operator first negotiates for retransmission consent, which may be conditioned on significant payments or other concessions from cable operators, such as commitments to carry other program services offered by a station or an affiliated company, to purchase advertising on a station or to provide advertising availabilities on cable channels to a station or to provide cash compensation. This development results in increased operating costs for video service providers, which ultimately increases the rates for video subscribers.
 
The FCC and Congress have imposed additional requirements in this area, including restrictions on broadcasters’ ability to jointly negotiate with video providers for carriage of their stations, and the requirement that parties negotiate retransmission consent in good faith. The FCC has stated that it would not adopt additional rules governing good faith negotiations for retransmission consent, but it would be prepared to assist in negotiations when necessary. Additional government-mandated broadcast carriage obligations, including those related to the FCC’s newly adopted enhanced technical broadcasting option (Advanced Television Systems Committee 3.0), could disrupt existing programming commitments and increase our costs of carrying such programming.
 
Media Ownership Rules. The FCC took steps in 2017 to relax its media ownership rules, including restrictions on the number of commonly owned television stations per market as well as on newspaper/broadcast and radio/television station cross-ownership. After numerous court proceedings, the FCC’s rules were upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in April 2021. These changes relaxing media ownership rules will likely lead to increased consolidation of the television broadcast stations and station groups, with a corresponding increase in the negotiating leverage that broadcasters and station groups hold in retransmission consent negotiations, thereby possibly increasing the amounts we pay to broadcasters for retransmission consent. The FCC is now conducting its regular review of its media ownership rules. We cannot predict the outcome of the ongoing reviews by the FCC and any subsequent review by the courts, and whether or to what extent any further revisions of the rules by the FCC or the courts may affect our operations or impose additional costs on our business.
 
Pole Attachments. Federal law requires most telephone companies and electric power utilities owning utility poles to provide cable systems with access to poles and underground conduits. Federal law also requires those entities to charge reasonable rates to cable operators for utilizing space on such poles or in such underground conduits. The FCC’s pole attachment rules contain a formula for calculating pole rental rates that provide for similar rates for telecommunications attachments and cable attachments and prohibit utility companies from charging higher rates for pole attachments used to provide broadband internet access service. The FCC has also adopted rules to facilitate new attachments, including a one-touch make-ready procedure for new attachments. Those one-touch make-ready rules took effect and were upheld in August 2020 in response to challenges in the Federal courts by utility companies. We cannot predict how any future changes to the pole attachment rules may affect our operations or impose costs on our business. As a general matter, changes to our pole attachment rate structure could significantly increase our annual pole attachment costs.

Federal Copyright Issues. The Copyright Act of 1976, as amended (the “Copyright Act”), gives cable systems the ability, under certain terms and conditions and assuming that any applicable retransmission consents have been obtained, to retransmit the signals of television stations pursuant to a compulsory copyright license. The U.S. Copyright Office is considering requests for clarification and revisions of certain cable compulsory copyright license reporting requirements, and from time to time, other revisions to the cable compulsory copyright rules are considered. We cannot predict the outcome of any such inquiries. However, it is possible that changes in the rules or copyright compulsory license fee computations or compliance procedures could have an adverse effect on our business by, for example, increasing copyright compulsory license fee costs or by causing us to reduce or discontinue carriage of certain broadcast signals that we currently carry on a discretionary basis. Copyright clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations. Cable operators also must obtain music rights for locally originated programming and advertising from the major music performing rights organizations. These licensing fees have been the source of litigation in the past, and we cannot predict with certainty whether license fee disputes may arise in the future.
Customer Equipment. Congress, the FCC and other government agencies have for some time been developing and implementing regulations that affect the types of set-top boxes that cable operators can lease or deploy to their subscribers. Prior to 2015, FCC rules banned the integration of security and non-security function in set-top boxes and required multichannel video programming distributors to allow third-party vendors to provide set-top boxes with basic converter functions. In 2015, Congress repealed the integration ban and mandated that the FCC establish a working group to identify, report on and recommend a successor technology- and platform-neutral security solution. Various parties continue to advocate to Congress and the administrative agencies for new regulatory approaches to reduce consumer dependency on traditional operator-provided set-top boxes that, if adopted, could affect our business in the future. We cannot predict if or when new changes may be proposed, what effect such changes may have on our operations, or if they will increase our costs and impair our ability to deliver programming to our customers.
Other Regulatory Requirements. The FCC regulates various other aspects of our video business, including, among other things, equal employment opportunity obligations; customer service standards; technical service standards; mandatory blackouts of certain network and syndicated programming; restrictions on political advertising; restrictions on advertising in children’s programming; maintenance of public files; emergency alert systems; inside wiring and exclusive contracts for service provided to apartment and condominium complexes; and disability access, including requirements governing video-description and closed-captioning. Each of these regulations restricts our business practices to varying degrees and may impose additional costs on our operations. We cannot predict whether, when or to what extent changes to these and other regulations may affect our operations or costs.
Voice Services
 
Our voice services are subject to varying degrees of Federal and state regulation. Telecommunications services are subject to extensive regulation at both the Federal and state levels while interconnected VoIP services are subject to a lesser degree of regulation.
Voice Over Internet Protocol. Service providers, including us and others, offer interconnected VoIP service, which permits users to make voice calls over broadband communications networks, including the internet, to recipients on the public switched telephone network (“PSTN”) and other broadband communications networks. Federal law preempts state and local regulatory barriers to the offering of voice service by service providers, and the FCC and Federal courts generally have preempted state laws that seek to regulate or classify VoIP.
 
The FCC has held that VoIP services are internet protocol-enabled services, which are interstate in nature and thus subject exclusively to the FCC’s Federal jurisdiction and not to state regulation. This decision was upheld on appeal, although the FCC has an ongoing proceeding to consider whether VoIP services provided by service providers are properly classified as an “information service,” “telecommunications service” or some other new category of service. This determination, once made, could have numerous regulatory implications for service providers that provide interconnected VoIP services, including us. Although the FCC has yet to ascribe a regulatory definition to VoIP services, the FCC nevertheless has imposed numerous obligations on interconnected VoIP service providers, some of which are discussed more fully below.
 
In 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota held that the VoIP service of another cable operator was an “information service” rather than a “telecommunications service,” which would have made it subject to entry and rate regulation and which prevented the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission from regulating VoIP as a telecommunications service in Minnesota. The district court’s decision was upheld on appeal and the U.S. Supreme Court denied review of the case. We cannot predict whether other states will attempt to subject VoIP services to entry and rate regulation, the outcome of such proceedings or how those proceedings may affect our operations or impose costs on our business.

State Regulation of Telecommunications Services. We offer telecommunications services as competitive local exchange carriers (“CLECs”) through several of our subsidiaries. Providers of telecommunications services usually are required to obtain licenses or authorizations from state regulatory commissions prior to offering intrastate telecommunications services. We hold licenses to provide CLEC telecommunications services in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas. We also are required to comply with state reporting, fee payment, tariffing and other obligations imposed on telecommunications services. Many states require prior approval for corporate and financial transactions, and compliance with these requirements could delay and increase the cost we incur to complete such transactions. Failure to comply with requirements applicable to telecommunications services could subject us to fines, penalties or other enforcement consequences.
 
Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier Regulation. We offer telecommunications services as an incumbent local exchange carrier (“ILEC”) in Georgia, Missouri and South Carolina through our subsidiaries. ILECs generally are subject to more stringent regulation than CLECs. Federal law imposes a variety of duties on all telecommunications carriers providing local telephone services, including requirements to interconnect with other telecommunications carriers; establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the completion of calls; permit the resale of services; permit users to retain their telephone numbers when changing carriers; and provide competing carriers access to poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way. ILECs are subject to additional duties to offer interconnection at any technically feasible point within their networks on non-discriminatory, cost-based terms; offer co-location of competitors’ equipment at their premises on a non-discriminatory basis; make available some of their network facilities, features and capabilities, referred to as Unbundled Network Elements, on non-discriminatory, cost-based terms; and offer wholesale versions of their retail services for resale at discounted rates. Our ILEC subsidiaries are currently exempt from certain of these obligations because they qualify as “rural telephone companies” under Federal law. Failure to comply with requirements applicable to ILEC operations could subject us to fines, penalties or other enforcement consequences.
 
Emergency 911 Services. The FCC has ruled that an interconnected VoIP service provider that enables its customers to make calls to and receive calls from persons who use the PSTN must provide its customers with the same enhanced 911 (“E911”) features that traditional telephone, telecommunications and wireless companies are obligated to provide. The FCC has also established indoor location requirements when E911 calls are made by interconnected VoIP subscribers. The FCC also requires certain providers of facilities-based fixed, residential voice services, which includes interconnected VoIP service providers, to offer backup power options to consumers and to inform consumers of the availability of such options. In October 2019, the FCC clarified that state, local, and tribal governments cannot charge the same class of subscribers higher total 911 fees for VoIP services than for traditional telecommunications services with the same 911 calling capability.
CALEA. FCC regulations require providers of voice services to comply with the requirements of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, which requires covered entities and their equipment suppliers to deploy equipment that law enforcement officials can access readily for lawful wiretap purposes.
 
Universal Service Contributions. The FCC has determined that interconnected VoIP service providers must contribute to the Federal Universal Service Fund (the “USF”). Providers of telecommunications service also are required to contribute to the Federal USF. The amount of a company’s USF contribution is based on a percentage of revenues earned from end-user interstate and international telecommunications and/or interconnected VoIP services. We are permitted to recover these contributions from our customers. In 2012, the FCC initiated a proceeding that focused on reforming the nature and manner in which entities should contribute to the USF and at what levels. Some have suggested that Federal USF contribution requirements be imposed on broadband internet access service providers. We cannot predict whether and how such reform will occur and the extent to which it may affect providers of VoIP, telecommunications and broadband internet access services, including us and our competitors.
 
States also may impose state USF fees on telecommunications services, and the FCC has determined that states may impose state USF fees on interconnected VoIP service providers subject to certain limitations and requirements. State USF contributions often are based on a percentage of revenues earned from end-user intrastate telecommunications services and/or interconnected VoIP services, and we are typically permitted to recover these contributions from our customers. We cannot predict whether or how the imposition of such state-based universal service fees will affect our operations and business.
 
Federal Subsidies and Grants. The FCC has adopted rules intended to transition the USF so that it supports the build out of broadband rather than telecommunications facilities. Certain of our subsidiaries providing telecommunications services have been designated as eligible telecommunications carriers (“ETCs”) and as such receive or will receive Federal and state funds for operations in Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Carolina. We also receive reimbursement from the schools and libraries universal service support program, commonly known as E-rate, and from the Rural Health Care Fund for discounted services provided throughout our service territory. The FCC has several proceedings pending that could affect our ability to continue receiving such Federal funding. We cannot predict whether or how these programs will be changed, or how such changes will affect our operations or business. Some of our ILEC subsidiaries also receive disbursements from the federal USF under Phase 2 of the FCC’s Alternative Connect America Cost Model program. To continue to receive such disbursements, we are required to meet certain build-out milestones over the next ten years. We also were a grant recipient under the FCC’s Rural Broadband Experiment program, which requires us to meet certain build-out and public service obligations over a five-year period. We are also a grant recipient under the FCC’s RDOF program, which requires us to meet certain build-out and public service obligations over a ten-year period. While we intend to satisfy these build-out obligations within the required timeframes, there can be no assurance that we will complete the build-out in a timely manner or at all. We also cannot predict what impact the costs of complying with the build-out obligations will have on our operations.

In addition, the FCC has focused on subsidizing broadband deployment and this shift could help some of our competitors. For example, the FCC revised the program that provides universal service support for services to schools and libraries to shift support from voice services to broadband services and to deployment of Wi-Fi networks. Similarly, the FCC has expanded its Lifeline subsidy program for low-income consumers to cover broadband services in addition to voice services and is considering further changes that may affect the Lifeline program. We cannot predict whether or how these programs will be changed, or the impact such changes will have on our operations or business.
 
Intercarrier Compensation. The FCC regulates switched access service rates imposed by local telecommunications carriers on interexchange carriers for the origination and termination of long-distance telecommunications traffic. The FCC has adopted intercarrier compensation rules under which switched access service rates for all traffic that interconnects with the PSTN were reduced and a uniform bill-and-keep framework for both intrastate and interstate terminating access traffic will result. The reforms required by the FCC’s rules are being phased in over a multi-year period. Future FCC determinations regarding the rates, terms and conditions for transporting and terminating such traffic could have a profound and material effect on the profitability of providing voice and data services.
Customer Proprietary Network Information. Telecommunications services and interconnected VoIP services are subject to CPNI protections, which extend CPNI protection requirements to such providers. CPNI is information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, location and amount of a voice customer’s use. These requirements generally increase the cost of providing voice service, as providers must implement various safeguards to protect CPNI from unauthorized disclosure.
 
Access for Persons with Disabilities. FCC regulations require providers of interconnected VoIP services to comply with all disability access requirements that apply to telecommunications services, including the provision of telecommunications relay services for persons with speech or hearing impairments. The FCC also has adopted reporting requirements associated with disability access obligations. We must also contribute to the interstate Telecommunications Relay Service Fund to support such access. These requirements generally have had the effect of increasing the cost of providing voice services.
 
Service Discontinuance and Outage Obligations. The FCC has adopted rules subjecting providers of interconnected VoIP services to the same service discontinuance requirements applicable to providers of wireline telecommunication services. The FCC has also adopted mandatory outage reporting requirements for interconnected VoIP service providers, which apply when customers of interconnected VoIP service lose service or connectivity and, as a result, are unable to access 911 service. Telecommunications services are subject to similar requirements. Along with other FCC actions described herein that impose legacy telecom obligations on interconnected VoIP providers, this development subjects our interconnected VoIP services to greater regulation and, therefore, greater burdens and costs.
Regulatory Fees. The FCC requires telecommunications service and interconnected VoIP service providers to contribute to shared costs of FCC regulation through an annual regulatory fee assessment. These fees have increased our cost of providing voice services. The FCC revises its regulatory fees from time to time and sometimes creates new fees. We cannot predict when or the extent to which the FCC will adopt new rules or regulatory fees affecting telecommunications service and VoIP service providers, which could affect our cost of doing business.
Local Number Portability. Providers of telecommunications services and interconnected VoIP services and their “numbering partners” must ensure that their subscribers have the ability to port their telephone numbers when changing service providers. We also must contribute funds to cover the shared costs of local number portability and the costs of the North American Numbering Plan Administration. FCC rules require additional numbering requirements, such as allowing consumers access to abbreviated dialing codes like 211 and 311 in certain circumstances, to be applied to interconnected VoIP service providers. Although consumers’ ability to port their existing telephone numbers to interconnected VoIP service has created additional opportunities for us to gain voice customers, the local number portability and associated rules overall have had the effect of increasing the cost of providing voice service.

Rural Calling Issues. The FCC has adopted rules to combat problems with the completion of long-distance calls to rural areas. The rules applied detailed record keeping, record retention and reporting requirements on all voice providers, including VoIP service providers, subject to certain exceptions. The rules also prohibit VoIP service providers (and other voice providers) from using false audible ringing when originating calls.
Robocalling. The FCC has adopted rules requiring voice providers to implement the industry-adopted STIR/SHAKEN framework in their networks to authenticate caller ID in order to prevent spoofed robocalls from reaching consumers. The new rules require providers to certify compliance with the framework and make compliance checks before accepting certain types of traffic for termination on their network. Compliance with these rules subjects our voice services to greater compliance costs and have increased the cost of providing voice service.
State and Local Taxes
 
The Internet Tax Freedom Act prohibits most states and localities from imposing taxes on internet access service charges. In addition, the FCC’s decision to rescind the majority of the rules adopted in the Open Internet Order may currently hinder states and localities that seek to impose additional taxes and fees on our data services, but that could change to the extent the FCC or Congress takes further action with regard to net neutrality requirements. Legislative and administrative proceedings in some states and localities have imposed or are considering adopting changes to general business taxes, central assessments for property tax and new taxes and fees applicable to our services. Often, DBS and other competitors that deliver their services over the internet do not face similar state tax and fee burdens.
