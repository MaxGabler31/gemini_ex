Presentation of Financial and Operating Data
On June 30, 2014, the Company and Jason Partners Holdings Inc. (“Jason” or “Seller”) completed a transaction in which JPHI Holdings Inc. (“JPHI”), then a majority owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired all of the capital stock of Jason from its then current owners, Saw Mill Capital, LLC, Falcon Investment Advisors, LLC and other investors (the “Business Combination”) pursuant to a stock purchase agreement, dated as of March 16, 2014 (the “Purchase Agreement”). In connection with the Business Combination, the Company entered into new senior secured credit facilities with a syndicate of lenders in the aggregate amount of approximately $460.0 million, which was primarily used to refinance existing indebtedness, pay transaction fees and expenses and pay a portion of the purchase price under the Purchase Agreement. The purchase price under the Purchase Agreement was also funded with cash held in our initial public offering trust account, the contribution of Jason common stock to JPHI by certain members of Seller and certain directors and management of Jason Incorporated (collectively, the “Rollover Participants”) in exchange for JPHI stock, and the proceeds from the sale of our 8% Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) in a private placement that closed simultaneously with the Business Combination. The Business Combination was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, “Business Combinations.” Accordingly, we are treated as the legal and accounting acquirer and Jason is treated as the legal and accounting acquiree. As a result of the application of the acquisition method of accounting as of the effective time of the acquisition, the financial statements for the predecessor period and for the successor period are presented on a different basis and, therefore, the financial information and operating data presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the predecessor period is that of Jason Partners Holdings Inc and the successor period is that of Jason Industries. 
Description of Business Segments 
Jason Industries’ global industrial platform encompasses a diverse group of industries, geographies and end markets. Through our four business segments, we deliver an array of industrial consumables and critical manufactured components to a number of industries, including industrial equipment, motorcycles, lawn and turf care, rail and automotive. The highly fragmented nature of the Company’s end markets creates growth opportunities given our established global footprint and leading share positions. 
Net sales are distributed amongst the four segments as follows: 
 | Year ended December 31,

Finishing 
Market/Industry Overview 
The finishing segment’s product lines are comprised of industrial brushes, polishing buffs and compounds, and abrasives used primarily in the metalworking, welding, construction and manufacturing industries. The market for finishing products is highly fragmented with most participants having single or limited product lines and serving specific geographic markets. While the finishing business competes with numerous domestic and international companies across a variety of product lines, we do not believe that any one competitor directly competes with us on all of our product lines. We believe we are the only market participant that reaches all regions of the world. End users of finishing products are broadly diversified across many sectors of the economy. In the long-term, the finishing market is closely tied to overall growth in industrial production, which we believe has fundamental long-term growth potential. 
The finishing market is also characterized by the need for sophisticated manufacturing equipment, the ability to produce a broad number of niche products and the flexibility in manufacturing operations to adapt to ever-changing customer demands and schedules. We believe entry into markets by competitors with lower labor costs, including foreign competitors, will be limited because labor is a relatively small portion of total manufacturing costs. The cost of labor, manufacturing, shipping and logistics is dramatically rising in countries such as China and customers continue to have increasing demand for shorter lead times and lower inventory and carrying costs.

Key Products 
Through the finishing business, which represented 33.9% of the Company’s 2018 revenue, Jason Industries produces and supplies industrial brushes, polishing buffs and compounds, and abrasives. Osborn has been in operation since 1887. Our products are used in a variety of applications with no single customer or industry accounting for a significant portion of business revenue. The Company has strategic facilities located globally, including production sites in low-cost locations such as China, India, Portugal, Romania and Mexico. 
The finishing business is a one-stop provider of standard and customized brush, polishing, and abrasives products used across multiple industries, including aerospace, automotive, construction, engineering, plastic, steel, hardware, welding and shipbuilding, among others. Our broad product suite is composed of brush types used for a variety of applications, including power, maintenance, strip, punch, and roller brushes. These products are marketed under leading brand names that include Osborn® and Sealeze®. Our buff products are sold under the JacksonLea® and Lippert Unipol® brands and are comprised of industrial buffs and abrasives used primarily to finish parts requiring a high degree of luster and/or a satin or textured surface. In addition to manufacturing buffs, the Company also produces the industry’s broadest product line of buffing compounds available in liquid or bar form that are customized to specific end use requirements. Our abrasive products are marketed under the DRONCO® and Osborn® brands and include bonded abrasives such as cutting and grinding wheels and flap discs, as well as diamond cutting wheels and tools. We also service customers with products complementing our brush, polishing, and abrasives lines, including heavy-duty idler rollers for high-capacity precision load handling sold under the Load Runners® brand. 
The Company has representatives who reach more than 30,000 customers in approximately 130 countries worldwide. During 2018, the finishing segment derived approximately 33% of its sales from North America and the majority of the remaining revenue from Europe. We service our diverse customer base through U.S. facilities in Indiana and Ohio and 12 foreign countries, including joint ventures in China and Taiwan. Our manufacturing and service locations allow us to work on a regional and local basis with customers to develop custom products and provide significant technical support, resulting in strong relationships with our top customers that average 25 years. In addition, the Company has invested in state-of-the-art laboratories in Richmond, Indiana and Burgwald, Germany to provide further technical design, testing and support capabilities for our customers. 
Components 
Market/Industry Overview 
The market for component products is highly fragmented with most participants having single or limited product lines, serving specific geographic markets or providing niche capabilities applicable to a limited customer base. While we compete with certain domestic and international competitors across a portion of our product lines, we believe that no one competitor directly competes with us across all of our product lines. End users of component products are diversified across various sectors of the economy. 
Demand in the components market is influenced by the broader industrial manufacturing market, as well as trends in the perforated and expanded metal, rail and commercial equipment industries. The best gauge of domestic industrial production is the U.S. Industrial Production Index, which measures the monthly level of output arising from the manufacturing, mining and gas sectors. 
Key Products 
Through the components business, which represented 13.5% of the Company’s 2018 revenue, we manufacture a range of expanded and perforated metal components and slip resistant surfaces. The Company is a provider of components that are used in a broad array of products, including railcars, air and liquid filtration, hardware, off-road equipment and security fencing. The components business operates through the Metalex and Morton brands. In 2016, we made the strategic decision to discontinue product lines under the Assembled Products brand and in 2018, we also exited the non-core smart utility meter subassemblies product lines.  
Within each of the components business product categories, our strategy is to have engineers work alongside customers to create value-added components and solutions for various end products. Our engineering resources, manufacturing capabilities and low cost production availability through our operation in Mexico provide opportunities to deliver value to customers. These characteristics drive long-standing relationships with our top customers that average over 20 years.

Seating 
Market/Industry Overview 
The seating business product line includes motorcycle seats; operator seats for construction, agriculture, lawn and turf care and other industrial equipment markets; and seating for the power sports market. The market for seating products is dominated by several large domestic and international participants, who are often awarded contracts as the sole supplier for a particular motorcycle, riding lawn mower or other construction, agriculture or material handling platform. We believe that competitive differentiation is based mostly on innovative styling, ergonomic comfort, manufacturing flexibility, quality, price and delivery. 
Motorcycle production has experienced a decline over the past several years and we believe future demand will mirror global motorcycle market trends. The construction market is closely tied to overall growth in industrial production, which we believe has long-term growth potential. Demand for lawn, turf care and power sports equipment is primarily dependent on weather and trends in personal consumption expenditures, recreational and leisure activities, and residential and commercial real estate construction and sales. The market for lawn and turf care equipment has remained relatively flat in the past year and we expect it to mirror general economic conditions. 
Key Products 
Through the seating business, which represented 26.2% of the Company’s 2018 revenue, the Company provides static and suspension seating solutions for a variety of applications, including motorcycle, agricultural, construction, industrial, lawn and turf care, and power sports. Milsco has provided high-quality seats since 1934. The seating business operates under the Milsco brand, which was originally established as a harness maker in 1924 and, early in its history, gained notice as the first company to put padded seating on tractors and farm equipment. 
The seating business offers a distinct vertically integrated operating model, which includes a full range of functions, such as research and development, design and engineering, manufacturing of components and final assembly. Through our broad manufacturing capabilities and high quality products, we have established longstanding relationships with our top customers, which average over 30 years. 
Acoustics 
Market/Industry Overview 
The market for automotive acoustical products is dominated by several large domestic and international participants. These participants are often awarded contracts as the sole supplier for a particular automotive platform. Competition includes manufacturers of mechanically bonded non-woven products, resin-bonded products, injection molded and thermoformed plastic and urethane foam. Competition is based on innovative styling, price, acoustical performance, durability and weight. Engineering, design and innovation, and manufacturing footprint, are key distinguishing factors because acoustical products represent a small percentage of the total cost to manufacture an automobile.
Growth in the automotive acoustics market is driven by increasing demand for enhanced acoustics, lighter weight and improved noise, vibration and harshness characteristics within the automotive market. As overall vehicle quality has improved, consumers have increasingly equated quality with the acoustic performance of a vehicle. As a result, car manufacturers have expended significant capital for sophisticated acoustical testing systems and laboratories. In addition, an increasing regulatory focus on reducing vehicle mass, increasing fuel-efficiency and stringent end of vehicle life recycling standards have driven the penetration of non-woven materials that are lighter than other acoustical products and that utilize recycled post-industrial textile fibers and recycled PET containers. The replacement of interior and exterior products previously served by plastic-based materials with structured non-woven acoustical products has created a trend in new vehicle designs with vehicle manufacturers, which has helped to expand non-woven acoustical content per vehicle.
Key Products 
Through the acoustics business, which represented 26.4% of the Company’s 2018 revenue, we manufacture engineered non-woven, fiber-based acoustical and structural products primarily for the automotive industry. Janesville has developed extensive design and manufacturing expertise over its 140 year history that allows it to provide custom acoustical solutions for each vehicle platform it serves. We market our products as being lighter, having improved acoustical performance, enhancing aesthetics, and being easier to install than other acoustical products manufactured by our competitors. As a result, our products are used in a large share of light vehicles manufactured in North America today, including 10 of 2018’s top 20 models.
We believe the acoustics business offers a broad product line of value-added, higher margin components used in a wide range of vehicles, including automobiles, sport utility vehicles, autonomous and light trucks, as well as in the industrial and transportation markets. The Company has focused on developing premier lightweight fiber-based solutions that provide 
5

competitive or superior acoustical properties. Our production of non-woven fiber-based products is organized by the form in which it is supplied: (i) die cut, (ii) molded, (iii) rolls and blanks, and (iv) other non-woven products.
The acoustics business operates principally as an automotive Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) and Tier-1 supplier. The Company has focused on increasing sales directly to automotive OEMs, which allows us to integrate our technology and value-added capabilities within OEM organizations. These efforts have shifted sales to what we believe is a more desirable balance between OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers while also broadening the number of vehicle platforms that utilize the Company’s products. Substantially all automotive products are sole sourced by customers for a particular vehicle and are used for the life of the platform.
Competitive Strengths 
The Company believes the following key characteristics provide a competitive advantage and position us for future growth: 
Established Industry Leader Across Our Four Businesses 
The Company’s businesses have developed leading positions across various niche markets that enhance end user’s comfort, safety and productivity. For example, in our turf care seats and polishing product lines, we believe we are more than twice the size of the next largest direct competitor. The Company’s market share positions have created a stable platform upon which to grow. Our products’ significant brand recognition helps to sustain our market share positions. The Company’s products are often viewed as a brand of choice for quality, dependability, value and continuous innovation. As a result, we have served many of our customers for over 25 years. Despite leading positions in many of our markets, we face competitive challenges in others. In the Company’s finishing and components segments, certain of our competitors are small and family-owned, operate with lower operating expenses, have lower profit expectations and/or supply lower cost commodity products, which allows such competitors to compete with us on pricing. In our seating segment, specifically with respect to highly technical seats for the agricultural and construction vehicle markets, the cost to customers of switching from a current supplier’s products to ours is high, and we believe certain of our competitors have established long-term and entrenched relationships with such customers. These costs and relationships make it challenging to convince such customers to purchase products from us instead of from their existing supplier. 
Superior Design & Manufacturing Solutions 
The Company has a track record of providing customers with innovative, customized solutions through production flexibility and collaboration with their design and manufacturing teams. We have consistently refined manufacturing processes to incorporate design technologies that improve design capabilities, breadth of product offering, product quality and manufacturing efficiency. 
Across our businesses, we maintain teams of designers and a diverse product selection in numerous geographic regions, which allows us to respond quickly to real-time customer needs. Our versatile design and manufacturing capabilities enable us to deliver differentiated and highly-customized solutions for customers by leveraging experienced engineering staff and technologically advanced manufacturing equipment. We believe our diverse product offerings and customized design and manufacturing capabilities have made us a preferred choice within many industries and an entrenched key solutions provider to customers. 
We believe we have become a partner at each stage in product development, which has deepened our relationships with an already entrenched customer base and driven revenue growth from existing accounts and new customers. 
Scalable Business Philosophy 
We use a consistent strategy and focus and deploy capital and resources across our businesses to projects with the highest returns on invested capital. Through corporate strategic planning initiatives, we annually assess our three-year outlook and goals, by using a policy deployment matrix disseminated throughout the organization. The Company’s management utilizes the strategic plan and resulting policy deployment matrix to develop an annual budget and profit plan and monitors progress towards long-term strategic goals. 
Across the Company’s businesses, our management team is focused on enhancing product innovation, efficiency, global accessibility and competitiveness. Shared best practices serve to continually improve the processes and products that our customers depend on by delivering customized, value-added solutions across the platform. This global reach offers customers a consistent and fully integrated manufacturing partner capable of serving their needs on a global, regional and local basis. 
Diverse, Global Footprint with Growing Presence in Emerging Markets 
The Company maintains 28 global manufacturing locations, consisting of 11 in the United States and 17 in foreign countries, giving the Company a strong international presence. Approximately 30% of the Company’s 2018 revenue was generated from products manufactured outside of the United States. In addition, our global presence enables us to take 
6

advantage of low-cost manufacturing at our facilities in China, India, Portugal, Romania, and Mexico and to meet the needs of local customers with operations in those regions. The Company continues to build upon its established presence in low-cost production locations through the expansion of owned operations and the development of joint ventures and sourcing relationships in Asia, Eastern Europe and Mexico. Our management believes that this global footprint also provides channels of organic growth through the introduction of products into new markets. Our management frequently evaluates our manufacturing, warehouse, distribution and sales locations to identify revenue enhancement opportunities, optimize production costs and ensure proximity to key customers. 
Growth Strategies 
The Company is focused on delivering sustained profitable growth through a number of avenues. Our growth initiatives are developed based on strategic plans conducted on an annual basis within each business. These plans are regularly reviewed and updated by our leadership team. As a result, we have a uniform strategy that focuses all of our resources on the following key initiatives: 
Margin Growth 
We are focused on continuous improvement in our profit margins through the development of higher-margin products, continued operational improvements and active product portfolio management. We anticipate our strategy of shifting toward innovative higher-value engineered products will continue to improve our pricing power and profitability. Among other initiatives, the Company is focused on redesigning products to reduce materials costs, continuing to reduce labor-intensive manufacturing processes and reducing logistics costs, which have traditionally been a significant component of overall costs and an important consideration when choosing its strategic manufacturing locations. 
The Company is focused on creating operational effectiveness at each of its business segments through deployment of lean principles and implementation of continuous operational improvement initiatives. While many of these activities have focused on implementing shop floor improvements, we have also targeted our selling and administrative functions in order to reduce the cost of serving our customers. The Company is also focused on improving profitability through an active evaluation of customer pricing and margins and a reduction in the number of parts and product variations that are produced. While these initiatives may result in lower overall sales, they are focused on creating shareholder value through higher margins and profitability, diversification, as well as lower inventory levels and working capital requirements.
The Company continuously evaluates its manufacturing footprint and utilization of manufacturing capacity. In recent years, the Company has completed or announced the consolidation of manufacturing facilities across its businesses. Reduction of fixed costs through optimization of manufacturing footprint and capacity will continue to be a driver of margin expansion and improving profitability. 
Market Share Gains 
While our businesses pursue growth within new and existing markets through customized strategies targeted for the markets we serve, all businesses are tasked with identifying and pursuing key growth opportunities through new products, geographies, sales channels and diversifying end markets served. Management believes we have the potential to increase market share due to the highly fragmented nature of our end markets. Each business has identified specific opportunities to expand market share, with associated incremental revenue targets.
Product Innovation 
Management believes that the Company’s strategy of developing innovative products will position us for continued growth. Working in collaboration with key customers, the design and manufacture of customized products that deliver value will support this growth. We believe that developing new products will allow us to deepen our value-added relationships with customers, open new opportunities for revenue generation, improve pricing power and enhance profitability. The Company has a focused and dedicated strategy for continuous innovation, which is supported by sophisticated manufacturing capabilities and engineering expertise. Research and development costs incurred in the development of new products or significant improvements to existing products were $3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, $3.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 and $4.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. This continued focus on innovation has driven successful new product introductions, which we believe will enable continued growth. 
Acquisitions
The Company uses acquisitions to increase revenues with existing customers and to expand revenues to both new markets and customers. The Company intends to pursue acquisitions that are accretive to EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) margins post-synergies, have a strategic focus that aligns with our core strategy and generate the appropriate estimated return on investment as part of our capital resource and allocation process. 
7

Customers 
The Company has an entrenched base of blue chip customers that are leaders in their respective markets. Our customer relationships often span decades in each business. Additionally, our customer base is diversified. In our finishing segment, no customers were at or above 10% of the revenue of such segment. In our components segment, two customers were at or above 10% of the revenues of such segment. In our seating and acoustics segments, three customers were at or above 10% of the revenues of such segments. Across all of Jason Industries, no customers were at or above 10% of 2018, 2017 or 2016 revenues. In 2018, our five largest customers represent a combined 28% of 2018 revenues. 
Suppliers and Raw Materials 
Polyurethane foam, vinyl, plastics, steel, polyester fiber, bicomponent fiber and machined fiber are the primary raw materials that we use to manufacture our products. There are a limited number of domestic and foreign suppliers of these raw materials. The Company generally orders supplies on a purchase order basis and generally incurs inbound freight charges to get the raw materials to our production facilities. Although our contracts and long term arrangements with our customers generally do not expressly allow us to pass through increases in our raw materials, energy costs, freight charges and other inputs to our customers, we endeavor to discuss price adjustments with our customers on a case by case basis where it makes business sense. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the spend with our top three material suppliers accounted for less than 10% of total material spend and our largest supplier accounted for approximately 3% of total spend. The Company makes an ongoing effort to reduce and contain raw material costs. We do not engage in raw material commodity hedging contracts, and instead attempt to reflect raw material price changes in the sale price of our products. 
Seasonality 
We experience seasonality of demand for our products in the seating business. Due to our experience in this market, we have adapted our business operations to manage this seasonality. The business also depends upon general economic conditions and other market factors beyond our control, and the Company serves customers in cyclical industries. See “Seasonality and Working Capital” in the accompanying “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained herein for further discussion.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 3,600 employees and manufactured products in 28 locations around the world. Approximately 55% of the seating segment’s hourly employees and 73% of the components segment’s hourly employees are unionized. Contracts are negotiated on a local basis, significantly mitigating the risk of a company-wide or segment level work stoppage. Additionally, approximately 800 of the Company’s employees reside in Europe, where trade union membership is common. We believe we have a strong relationship with our employees, including those represented by labor unions. 
Environmental Matters 
The Company’s operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to pollution and the protection of the environment, health, safety and natural resources, including those governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharges to water, the use, generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and other materials and the remediation of contaminated sites. The operation of manufacturing plants entails risks in these areas, and a failure by the Company to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, or to obtain and comply with the permits required for its operations, could result in civil or criminal fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third party claims for property damage and personal injury, requirements to clean up property or to pay for the capital or operating costs of cleanup, or regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, including the installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions. Moreover, if applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, become more stringent in the future, the Company could incur capital or operating costs beyond those currently anticipated. 
Compliance with environmental laws has not historically had a material adverse effect on the Company’s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and we anticipate that such compliance will not have a material effect on its business or financial condition in the future.
