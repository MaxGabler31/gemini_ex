Business is awarded as a result of our ability to successfully bid on and win the production and supply of parts for models that will be newly introduced to the market by the OEMs or winning business on existing programs. Our success is due to innovative technologies around design, engineering, and state-of-the-art solutions. 
Raw Materials 
The primary raw materials required for our operations are hot-rolled and cold-rolled coated steel, as well as, aluminum and magnesium ingots. We obtain steel from a number of primary steel producers and steel service centers. The majority of the steel is purchased through customers' steel buying programs. Under these programs, we purchase steel at the price that our customers negotiated with their steel suppliers. We take ownership of the steel in many instances; however, the customers are generally responsible for commodity price fluctuations. Through centralized purchasing, we attempt to purchase raw materials at the lowest competitive prices for the quantity purchased across a broad supplier base. The supply of steel available for processing is a function of the production levels of primary steel producers. A portion of our steel products and processing services are provided to customers on a toll processing basis. Under these arrangements, we charge a specified fee for operations performed without acquiring ownership of the steel and being burdened with the attendant costs of ownership or risk of loss. 
For our aluminum and magnesium, used in the CastLight® product brand, the cost of raw materials is adjusted frequently to align with secured purchase commitments based on customer releases or based on referenced metal index plus additional material cost spreads agreed to by us and our customers. Primary aluminum alloys are used in our proprietary "Thin Tech®" castings processes, which allow heat treat and enhanced mechanical properties. Secondary smelting is the process of recycling aluminum, which has a positive impact environmentally and economically. These types of alloys are used in our conventional die casting process. We purchase from suppliers in the U.S., Canada, Europe and China based on competitiveness and regional location. 
Competition 
We compete in the laser welding, stamping, die casting and close-tolerance machining industries. Competitors within our main product brands vary. BlankLight® competitors include numerous metal blanking companies ranging in all sizes, including raw material manufacturers and customers. Welded blank competition in North America includes TWB Company LLC and ArcelorMittal USA. Most laser welded blank competitors are affiliated with raw material or distribution providers. Competition for sales of automotive stamping and assemblies is also intense. StampLight® competitors include Gestamp, L&W, Inc., Flex-n-Gate Corporation, Midway Products Group Inc., Narmco Group and Kirchhoff Automotive Group. CastLight® competitors include Bocar Group, Cosma International (a Magna Company), Georg Fischer, Gnotec AB, KSM Casting Group, Madison Kipp Corporation (MKC), Meridian (subsidiary of Wangfeng Auto Holdings Group), Nemak, Pace Industries, RCM Industries and Ryobi Aluminum Casting (USA), Inc., which are all competing for a growing number of automotive projects. In almost all instances, we compete through our main strategies of "Lightweighting Without Compromise®" and "Lightweighting With Benefits®", which provides us with the ability to provide solutions that do not compromise part integrity such as performance, safety, sound and efficiency. Development and design optimization to lightweight products allows customers to achieve vehicle weight, fuel economy and/or ride and handling targets while favorably impacting the environment.
Employees 
As of October 31, 2019, we had approximately 3,600 employees of which approximately 2,100 are domestic and approximately 1,500 are international. Organized labor unions represent 15% of our U.S. hourly employees and 99% of our non-U.S. employees. 
Each of our unionized manufacturing facilities has its own labor agreement with its own expiration date. As a result, no contract expiration date affects more than one facility. 
Backlog 
A significant portion of our business pertains to automobile platforms for various model years. Orders against these platforms are subject to releases by the customer and are not considered firm orders until close to time of shipment. Backlog, therefore, is not a meaningful indicator of future performance. 
Seasonality 
Our business is moderately seasonal because many OEM customers close assembly plants primarily for periods in summer months and holiday seasons for model year changeovers. Shut-down periods vary by country. For additional information, refer to Note 19 "Quarterly Results of Operations" to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this report.

Environmental Matters 
We are subject to environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air, discharges to waterways and generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. 
We are also subject to laws and regulations that can require the remediation of contamination that exists at current or former facilities. In addition, we are subject to other federal and state laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters. The majority of our production facilities have permits and licenses allowing and regulating air emissions and water discharges. While the Company believes that at the present time its production facilities are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is impossible to predict whether compliance with these laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us in the future. 
ISO 14001 is a voluntary international standard issued in September 1996 and updated in 2015 by the International Organization for Standardization. ISO 14001 identifies the elements of an Environmental Management System ("EMS") necessary for an organization to effectively manage its effect on the environment. The ultimate objective of the standard is to integrate the EMS with overall business management processes and systems so that environmental considerations are a routine part of business decisions.  All of our manufacturing facilities are certified to the ISO 14001 standard. We have completed the certification process at each of our manufacturing facilities to the IATF 16949 standard, which has been the global benchmark for an international quality management system in the automotive industry.  
Research and Development
 We perform research, development, design and other engineering activities for the following primary reasons:

• | to provide solutions for customers


• | to integrate our leading technologies into advanced products and processes


• | to provide engineering support for all of our manufacturing sites


• | to provide technological expertise in engineering and design development

Along with our global manufacturing locations, we maintain Sales and Technical Centers in Asia (Shanghai, China), Europe (Gothenburg, Sweden) and North America (Plymouth, Michigan and Valley City, Ohio). Furthermore, we have Customer Service Centers in Germany (Munich and Stuttgart), Italy (Turin) and the United Kingdom (Evesham, England). Each of our Sales and Technical Centers is engaged in engineering, research and development efforts working closely with customers to develop custom solutions to meet their needs.
Intellectual Property
We hold 90 issued patents on a worldwide basis, including 31 issued U.S. patents and 47 patent applications in process worldwide. Of the 90 issued patents, 35% are in production use and/or are licensed to third parties and the remaining 65% are being considered for future production use or provide a strategic technological benefit to us. We do not materially rely on any single patent, nor will the expiration of any single patent materially affect our business. Our current patents expire over various periods into the year 2035. We are actively introducing and patenting new technology to replace formerly patented technology before the expiration of the existing patents. In the aggregate, our worldwide patent portfolio is materially important to our business as it enables us to achieve technological differentiation from our competitors. We also maintain 55 active trademark registrations and applications worldwide. In excess of 98% of these trademark registrations and applications are in commercial use by us or are licensed to third parties.
Segment and Geographic Information 
We conduct our business and report our information as one operating segment - Automotive and Commercial Vehicles. Our chief operating decision maker is the executive leadership team, which includes certain Vice Presidents, all Senior Vice Presidents and the Chief Executive Officer, as this team has the final authority over performance assessment and resource allocation decisions. In determining that one operating segment is appropriate, we considered the nature of the business activities and the existence of managers responsible for the operating activities. Customers and suppliers are substantially the same in the automotive and commercial vehicle industry.
Financial information regarding Company geographic mix is contained in Note 19 - "Business Segment Information" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.

Acquisitions 
On March 1, 2018, Shiloh acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital of Brabant Alucast Italy Site Verres S.r.l., a limited liability company organized under the laws of Italy, and Brabant Alucast The Netherlands Site Oss B.V., a limited liability company organized under the laws of the Netherlands (collectively "Brabant"). The acquisitions complement our global footprint, with the expansion of aluminum and magnesium casting capabilities, while providing capacity for growth. The final purchase price for the acquisitions, funded in cash, was $65.3 million.

lItem 1A. 
Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially affect our business, financial position and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing the Company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial position, operating results and cash flows.
Risks Related to Our Business 
A downturn in the global economy could harm demand for automotive and commercial vehicles that are manufactured with our products and, therefore, could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
The level of demand for our products depends primarily upon the level of consumer demand for new vehicles that are manufactured with our products. The global economic recession that began in 2008 had a significant adverse effect on our business, customers and suppliers and contributed to delayed and reduced purchases of passenger cars and commercial vehicles, including those manufactured with our products. Demand for and pricing of our products is also subject to economic conditions and other factors (e.g., energy costs, fuel costs, climate change concerns, vehicle age, consumer spending and preferences, materials used in production, commodity prices and changing technology) present in the various domestic and international markets in which our products are sold. If the global economy were to experience another significant downturn, depending upon its length, duration and severity, or any other event that results in a reduction of demand for automobiles, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 
Deterioration in the United States, Europe and other world economies could harm our customers’ and suppliers’ ability to access the capital markets, which may affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our customers and suppliers by making it increasingly difficult for them to obtain financing for their businesses and for their customers to obtain financing for automobile purchases. Our OEM customers typically require significant financing for their respective businesses. This financing often comes from securitization markets, which experience severe disruptions during global economic crises. Our suppliers, as well as our customers’ suppliers, may face similar difficulties in obtaining financing for their businesses. If capital is not available to our customers or suppliers, or if the cost of capital is prohibitively high, their businesses would be adversely affected, which could result in their restructuring or even reorganization or liquidation under applicable bankruptcy laws. Any such adverse effect on our customers or suppliers could materially adversely affect us, either through loss of revenues from any of our customers so affected, or due to our inability to meet our commitments without excessive expense, as a result of disruptions in supply caused by the suppliers so affected. Financial difficulties experienced by any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on us if such customers were unable to pay for the products we provide or if we experienced a loss of, or material reduction in, business from such customer. As a result of such difficulties, we could experience lost revenues, significant write-offs of accounts receivable, significant impairment charges, or additional restructurings. In addition, severe financial or other difficulties at any of our major suppliers could have a material adverse effect on us if we are unable to obtain on a timely basis and on similar economic terms the quantity and quality of components we require to produce products. Moreover, severe financial or operating difficulties at any automotive vehicle manufacturer or other significant supplier could have a significant disruptive effect on the entire industry, leading to supply chain disruptions and labor unrest, among other things. These disruptions could force OEMs and, in turn, other suppliers, including us, to reduce production or shut down plants. 
Our inability to obtain and maintain sufficient financing may harm our liquidity and financial position. 
Our working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending, in part, on the level, variability and timing of our customers’ production and the payment terms we have with our customers and suppliers. Our liquidity could be adversely affected if our suppliers were to suspend normal trade credit terms and require payment in advance or payment on delivery. If our available cash flows from operations is not sufficient to fund our ongoing cash needs, we would likely look to our cash balances and borrowing availability under our Credit Agreement (as defined hereinafter) to satisfy those needs. In 2013, we and our subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement, dated October 25, 2013, as amended (the "Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, Dutch Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Syndication Agent, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Book Managers, CIBC Bank, USA, Compass Bank and The Huntington National Bank, N.A., as Co-Documentation Agents and the other lender parties thereto. We entered into our ninth amendment to the Credit Agreement on June 6, 2019 (the "Amendment"), 
 7

which improved certain thresholds for the consolidated leverage retio and various baskets related to the indebtedness of foreign subsidiaries, disposition of assets, capital expenditures, and sale leaseback transactions. Additionally, this amendment adjusted the interest rate margins based on the applicable pricing tiers, but did not modify the aggregate revolving commitments under the Credit Agreement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to satisfy the financial covenants currently under the Credit Agreement, that we will be able to enter into favorable amendments in the future, that alternative sources of additional capital will be available on satisfactory terms or at all or that we will otherwise continue to have the ability to maintain sufficient capital financing. Inability to meet targeted profitability in the next fiscal year could result in a strain to comply with the leverage ratio, which becomes more restrictive each quarter in the next fiscal year. Insufficient liquidity may increase the risk of not being able to produce products or having to pay higher prices for inputs that may not be recovered in selling prices. 
We may be unable to realize revenues represented by awarded business, which could materially harm our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The realization of future revenues from awarded business is subject to risks and uncertainties, including the number of vehicles that our customers will actually produce, the timing of that production and the mix of options that our customers may choose. 
In addition to not having a commitment from our customers regarding any minimum number of products they must purchase from us if we obtain awarded business, the terms and conditions of the agreements with our customers typically provide that they have the contractual right to unilaterally terminate our contracts with only limited notice. If such contracts are terminated by our customers, our ability to obtain compensation from our customers for such termination is generally limited to the direct out-of-pocket costs that we incurred for inventory and not fully reimbursed tooling, and in certain rare instances, not fully depreciated capital expenditures. 
We base a substantial part of our financial and operational planning on the anticipated lifetime revenues of particular products. We calculate the anticipated lifetime revenues of a product by multiplying our expected price for a product by the forecasted production volume for that product during the length of time we expect the related vehicle to be in production. We use third-party forecasting services to provide long-term forecasts, which allow us to determine how long a vehicle is expected to be in production. If we over-estimate the production units or if a customer reduces its level of anticipated purchases of a particular platform as a result of reduced demand, our actual revenues for that platform may be substantially less than the lifetime revenues we had anticipated for that platform. 
Typically, it takes two to three years from the time a manufacturer awards a program until production begins. In many cases, we must commit substantial resources in preparation for production under awarded customer business well in advance of the customer’s production start date. Our results of operations may be affected due to delay in recovering these types of pre-production costs if our customers cancel awarded business, including cancellation in the event technology supporting the awarded business becomes obsolete. 
We are dependent upon large customers for current and future revenues. The loss of all, or a substantial portion, of our sales to any of these customers, or the loss of market share by these customers, could materially harm our financial position and results of operations.
We depend on major vehicle manufacturers for a substantial portion of our net revenues. For example, during 2019, General Motors and FCA accounted for 17.4% and 17.0% of our revenues, respectively. The loss of all, or a substantial portion, of our sales to any of our large-volume customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations by reducing cash flows and our ability to spread costs over a larger revenue base. We may also make fewer sales to major customers for a variety of reasons other than losses of business relationships, including but not limited to: (1) reduced or delayed customer requirements, (2) strikes or other work stoppages affecting production by the customers, (3) customer restructuring or reorganizations, (4) reduced demand for our customers’ products, (5) vehicle program discontinuance or (6) loss of business to competitors.
In addition, our OEM customers compete intensively against each other and other OEMs. The loss of market share by any of our significant OEM customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, unless we are able to achieve increased sales to other OEMs.
 8

The failure to be awarded new business for additional content on new or existing vehicle programs or to retain existing business could materially harm our business. 
We compete for new business at the beginning of the development of new vehicle programs and upon the redesign of existing programs by major OEM customers. New program development generally begins three-to-five years prior to the marketing of the underlying vehicles to the public. Redesign of existing programs begins during the life cycle of a platform, usually at least two-to-three years before the end of the platform’s life cycle. The failure to obtain new business on new programs or to retain or increase business on redesigned existing programs, could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, as a result of the relatively long lead times, it may be difficult in the short term for us to obtain new revenues to replace any unexpected decline in the sale of existing products. 
In addition, a component of our growth strategy is to bid on and be awarded new business for additional content on our customers’ new or existing vehicle programs, while at the same time maintaining existing business that we have a desire to maintain and renew. If we are unable to introduce, differentiate and enhance our product offerings, anticipate industry trends or keep pace with technological developments or if our competitors introduce lower cost and/or differentiated products that are perceived by our customers to compete with ours, we may be unable to grow and maintain our business with our customers, and our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality, suppliers and costs of new program launches could harm our financial performance. 
In connection with the award of new business, we obligate ourselves to deliver new products and services that are subject to our customers’ timing, performance and quality standards. Additionally, as a Tier 1 supplier, we must effectively coordinate the activities of numerous suppliers in order for the program launches of our products to be successful. Given the complexity of new program launches, we may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs. In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs; however, our sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of our customers’ introduction of new vehicles. Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality, suppliers and costs of these new program launches could harm our financial position, operating results and cash flows. Finally, even if we successfully manage the timing, quality, suppliers and costs of new program launches with respect to our operations, another of our customers’ suppliers may cause our customers’ production delays, which could harm our financial position, operating results and cash flows. 
Automotive production and sales are highly cyclical, which could harm our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
The highly cyclical nature of the automotive industry presents a risk that is outside our control and that often cannot be accurately predicted. The cyclical nature depends on general economic conditions and other factors, including interest rates, consumer confidence, consumer preferences, patterns of consumer spending, fuel costs and the automobile replacement cycle. In addition, customer production changeovers or new program launches may result in altered or delayed production cycles, which may reduce or delay purchases of our products by our customers. As a result, automotive production and sales may fluctuate significantly from year-to-year and such fluctuations may give rise to changes in demand for our products. Our business is directly related to the volume of automotive production and, because it has significant fixed production costs, declines in our customers’ production levels can have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. Decreases in demand for automobiles generally, or decreases in demand for our products in particular, could materially and harmfully affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
The automotive industry is seasonal, which could harm our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
The automotive industry is seasonal. Some of our largest OEM customers typically shut down vehicle production during certain months or weeks of the year. For example, our OEM customers in Europe typically shut down operations during portions of July and August and additional periods during the December and January holiday season, while our OEM customers in North America typically close assembly plants for periods in June and July for model year changeovers and for additional periods during the December and January holiday season. During these downturns, our customers will generally reduce the number of production days because of lower demand and reduce excess vehicle inventory. Such seasonality, or unanticipated changes in plant shutdown schedules, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

Changes in technology and developments within the automotive industry could affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The automotive industry is undergoing significant change, and we believe that the pace of that change will accelerate in the next several years. Technological changes, including the development of autonomous vehicles, new products and services, new business models or new methods of travel may disrupt the historic business model of the industry, reduce the demand for the purchase of automobiles and adversely impact the sales of our customers as well as our sales, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
A material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent it from meeting customer demand, reduce our revenues or negatively affect our results of operations and financial position. 
Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines or equipment within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including: 

• | unscheduled maintenance outages;


• | prolonged power failures;


• | cyber attacks;


• | an equipment failure;


• | labor difficulties, prolonged labor strikes or work stoppages;


• | disruptions in transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;


• | fires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural catastrophes;


• | war, terrorism or threats of terrorism or political unrest;


• | governmental regulations or intervention; and


• | other unexpected problems.

Any such disruption could prevent us from meeting customer orders, reduce our revenues or profits and negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.
The decreasing number of automotive parts suppliers and pricing pressures from our automotive customers could make it more difficult for us to compete in the highly competitive automotive industry. 

The automotive parts industry is highly competitive. Bankruptcies and consolidation among automotive parts suppliers are reducing the number of competitors, resulting in larger competitors who benefit from purchasing and distribution economies of scale. Our inability to compete with these larger suppliers in the future could result in a reduction of, or inability to increase, revenues, which would harm our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

We face significant competition within each of our major product areas. The principal competitive factors include price, quality, global presence, service, product performance, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation and timely delivery. We also face significant competitive pricing pressures from our automotive customers. Because of their purchasing size, our automotive customers can influence market participants to significantly reduce pricing in order to keep or win new business. If we are not able to offset pricing reductions resulting from these pressures by improving operating efficiencies and reducing expenditures, those pricing reductions may have an adverse effect on our business. 
We may not be able to continue to compete in the highly competitive automotive industry and increased competition or consolidation may have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Fluctuations between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could harm our financial results.
We derived $315,067 of our revenue in fiscal year 2019 from our non-U.S. operations. The financial position and results of operations of certain of our international operations are measured using the foreign currency in the jurisdiction of those operations as the functional currency. As a result, we are exposed to currency fluctuations both in receiving cash from its international operations and in translating its financial results back to U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities of our international operations are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date. Our income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during each fiscal quarter. A strengthening U.S. dollar against relevant foreign currency reduces the amount of income we recognize from our international operations. We cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results. As exchange rates vary, our results of operations and profitability may be harmed. We may use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to protect against certain foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from 
 10

foreign currency variations. The gains or losses associated with hedging activities may harm our results of operations. In addition, the portion of our revenue derived from international operations may increase in the future, due to the impact of acquisitions and overall growth in foreign markets, among other reasons. The risks we face in foreign currency transactions and translation may continue to increase as we further develop and expand our international operations.
We may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices or the method in which LIBOR is determined.
In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, the authority that regulates LIBOR, announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is the rate that represents the best practice as the alternative to USD-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from USD-LIBOR, and organizations are currently working on an industry wide and/or company specific transition from LIBOR to an alternative that will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates or financing costs to borrowers. We have material contracts that are indexed to USD-LIBOR, and we are monitoring this activity and evaluating the related risks. 
We are subject to risks related to our international operations. 
We sell our products worldwide from our manufacturing and distribution facilities in various regions and countries, including North America, Europe and Asia. Operations are subject to various risks which could have a material adverse effect on those operations or our business as a whole, including: 

• | exposure to changes of trade policies and agreements, including changes the North American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA"), including as a result of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (the "USMCA") or otherwise and other international trade agreements;


• | exposure to impact of tariffs or other forms of political incentive systems affecting international trade;


• | exposure to local economic conditions and labor issues;


• | exposure to local political conditions, including the risk of seizure of assets by a foreign government;


• | exposure to local social unrest, including any resultant acts of war, terrorism or similar events;


• | exposure to local public health issues and the resultant impact on economic and political conditions;


• | investment restrictions or requirements;


• | currency exchange rate fluctuations;


• | controls on the repatriation of cash, including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries,


• | export and import restrictions; and


• | difficulties in penetrating new markets due to established and entrenched competitors.

Increasing our manufacturing footprint in the Asian market, specifically China, is an important element of our long-term strategy. In addition, our strategy includes expanding our manufacturing footprint. As a result, our exposure to the risks described above may be greater in the future. The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential impact on us is unpredictable and varies from country to country.
Changes in the United Kingdom's economic and other relationships with the European Union could adversely affect us.
In June 2016, a majority of the voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union ("Brexit"). In March 2017, the United Kingdom formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw, thereby triggering a two-year negotiation period which has now been extended to January 31, 2020, unless further extension is agreed to by the parties. There remains significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, including the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a negotiated and bilaterally approved withdrawal plan. The Company does not have manufacturing operations in the United Kingdom but does have a customer service center in the United Kingdom and manufacturing facilities in the European Union. In addition, our supply chain and that of our customers is highly integrated across the European Union, and we are highly dependent on the free flow of goods in those regions. The ongoing uncertainty and potential re-imposition of border controls and customs duties on trade between the United Kingdom and European Union nations could negatively impact our competitive position, supplier and customer relationships and financial performance. The ultimate effects of "Brexit" on us will depend on the specific terms of any agreement the United Kingdom and the European Union reach to provide access to each other's respective markets. 
 11

We may continue to restructure our operations in the U.S. and various other countries and initiate additional cost reductions, but we may not succeed in doing so. 
In 2017, we announced a restructuring plan designed to improve future profitability and competitiveness. As we continue to assess our performance throughout North America and Europe, we may take additional restructuring actions to rationalize our operations. This could result in asset write-downs or impairments and reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. For example, the Company continues to proactively address the shift in consumer automotive preferences and the Company’s desire to increase flexibility in managing cyclical changes. We are continuing to implement a number of operational effectiveness initiatives aimed to improve productivity and reduce costs. These actions could lead to increased risks of labor unrest or strikes, litigation, negative publicity and business disruption. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our restructuring and/or cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. 
The U.S. Congress and presidential administration may make substantial changes to fiscal, political, regulatory and other federal policies that may adversely affect our business, financial position, operating results and cash flows.
Changes in general economic or political policies in the United States or other regions could adversely affect our business.  For example, the current administration under President Donald Trump has indicated that it may propose significant changes with respect to a variety of issues, including international trade agreements, import and export regulations, tariffs and customs duties, foreign relations, immigration laws, tax laws, corporate governance laws and corporate fuel economy standards, that could have a positive or negative impact on our business. The risks we face in our international operations may intensify if we further develop and expand our international operations.
Significant increases and fluctuations in raw materials pricing could materially harm us without proportionate recovery from our customers. 
Significant increases in the cost of certain raw materials used in our products, such as steel, aluminum and magnesium, or the cost of utility services required to produce our products, to the extent they are not timely reflected in the price we charge our customers or are otherwise mitigated, could materially and adversely impact our results. Prices for raw material inputs can be impacted by many factors, including developments in global commodities markets, international trade policies and developments in technology. The amount of steel available for processing is a function of the production levels of primary steel producers. A significant portion of our magnesium is sourced from China and could be subject to availability, trade policies and price.
While we have been successful in the past recovering a significant portion of raw material costs, there is no assurance that we will continue to do so, or that increases in raw material costs will not adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, significant increases in raw material prices may cause customers to redesign certain components or use alternative materials, which could result in reduced revenues, which could in turn harm our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The volatility of steel prices could materially harm our results of operations. 
A by-product of our production process is the generation of offal. We typically sell offal in secondary markets, which are similar to the steel markets. We generally share recoveries from sales of offal with our customers either through scrap sharing agreements, in cases in which we are participating in resale programs, or through product pricing, in cases in which we purchase steel directly from steel suppliers. In either situation, we may be affected by the fluctuation in scrap steel prices, either positively or negatively, in relation to our various customer agreements. As offal prices generally increase and decrease as steel prices increase and decrease, sales of offal may mitigate the impact of the volatility of steel price increases, as well as limit the benefits reaped from steel price declines. Any volatility in offal and steel prices could materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Disruptions in the automotive supply chain could materially harm our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
The automotive supply chain is subject to disruptions because we, along with our customers and suppliers, attempt to maintain low inventory levels in order to manage our working capital. Disruptions in our supply chain could result from a variety of situations, such as the closure of one or more of our or our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns, electrical outages, fires, explosions or political upheaval. Disruptions could also result from logistical 
 12

complications due to weather, earthquakes, or other natural or nuclear disasters, mechanical failures, technology disruptions or delayed customs processing. 
If we are the cause for a customer to halt production, the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses due to such disruption from us. Any such disruptions affecting us or caused by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
Longer product lives of automotive parts may harm demand for some of our products. 
The average useful life of automobiles and automotive parts may continue to increase due to innovations in products and technologies. As automobiles and automotive parts product life cycles lengthen, opportunities to supply components for new programs may occur less frequently, which may reduce demand for some of our products. 
Discontinuation of the vehicle models, engines or transmissions for which we manufacture products may harm our business, financial position and results of operations. 
Our typical sales contract provides for supplying a customer with product requirements for particular programs, rather than manufacturing a specific quantity of components and systems. The initial terms of our sales contracts typically range from one to seven years, with automatic renewal provisions that generally result in our contracts running for the life of the program. Our contracts do not require our customers to purchase a minimum number of components or systems. The loss of awarded business or significant reduction in demand for vehicles for which we produce components and systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
We may pursue acquisitions or strategic alliances that we may not successfully integrate or that may divert management’s attention and resources. 
We may pursue acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances in the future. However, we may not be able to identify and secure suitable opportunities. Our ability to consummate and integrate effectively any acquisitions or enter into strategic alliances on terms that are favorable to us may be limited by a number of factors, such as competition for attractive targets and, to the extent necessary, our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. 
In addition, if a potential acquisition target, joint venture, or strategic alliance candidate is identified, we may fail to enter into a definitive agreement with the candidate on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The negotiation and completion of potential acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances, whether or not ultimately consummated, could also require significant diversion of management’s time and resources and could potentially disrupt our existing business. The expected synergies and cost savings from acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances may not be realized and we may not achieve the expected results, including the synergies and cost savings we expect to realize. We may also have to incur significant charges in connection with future acquisitions. Future acquisitions or strategic alliances could also potentially result in the incurrence of additional indebtedness, dilutive issuance of equity securities, costs and contingent liabilities. We may also have to obtain approvals and licenses from the relevant government authorities for such transactions to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, which could result in increased costs and delay. Future strategic alliances or acquisitions may expose us to additional potential risks, including risks associated with: 

• | uncertainties in assessing the value, strengths and potential profitability of, and identifying the extent of all weaknesses, risks and contingent and other liabilities of, acquisition targets or other transaction candidates;


• | our inability to generate sufficient revenue to recover costs and expenses of the strategic alliances or acquisitions;


• | potential loss of, or harm to, relationships with employees, customers and suppliers; and


• | unanticipated changes in business, industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition rationale.

Any of the above risks could significantly impair our ability to manage our business and materially harm our business, results of operations and financial position.
The hourly workforce in our industry is highly unionized and our business could be harmed by labor disruptions. 
As of October 31, 2019, 15% of our U.S. hourly employees and 99% of our non-U.S. employees were unionized. Although we consider our current relations with our employees to be satisfactory, if major work disruptions were to occur, our business could be harmed by, for instance, a loss of revenues, increased costs or reduced profitability. We have not experienced a material labor disruption in our recent history, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience a material labor disruption at one of our facilities in the future in the course of renegotiation of our labor arrangements or otherwise. 
 13

In addition, many of the hourly employees of our customers in North America and many of their other suppliers are unionized. Vehicle manufacturers, their suppliers and their respective employees in other countries are also subject to labor agreements. A work stoppage or strike at one of our production facilities, at those of a customer, or impacting a supplier of ours or any of our customers, such as the 2019 dispute between the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (collectively, the "United Auto Workers") and General Motors, could have a material adverse impact on us by disrupting demand for our products and/or our ability to manufacture our products.
We may incur costs related to product warranties, legal proceedings and other claims, which could materially harm our financial position and results of operations. 
From time to time, we receive product warranty claims from our customers, as a result of which we may be required to bear the costs of repair or replacement of certain of our products. Vehicle manufacturers require their outside suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and to be responsible for the operation of these component products in new vehicles sold to consumers. Warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all vehicles containing any of our products.
We vigorously defend ourselves in connection with all of the matters described above. We cannot, however, assure that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial statements. In future periods, we could be subject to cash costs or charges to earnings if any of these matters are resolved unfavorably to us in amounts exceeding any reserves for such matters. 
Product recalls by vehicle manufacturers could negatively impact our production levels, which could materially harm our business, financial position and results of operations. 
Historically, there have been product recalls by some of the world’s largest vehicle manufacturers. Our risk to recalls of the products we manufacture is generally related to our workmanship on the product as opposed to the material and design of the products, as the design generally belongs to our customers and our parts are produced according to customer's specifications. Recalls, whether or not related to claims against us, may result in decreased vehicle production as a result of a manufacturer focusing its efforts on the problems underlying the recall rather than generating new sales volume. In addition, consumers may elect not to purchase vehicles manufactured by the vehicle manufacturer initiating the recall, or by other vehicle manufacturers, while the recalls persist. We do not maintain insurance in North America for product recall matters, as such insurance is not generally available on terms we deem acceptable. Any reduction in vehicle production volumes, especially by our OEM customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. 
We rely on information technology and a failure of our information technology infrastructure or a breach of our information security could adversely impact our business and operations. 
Our operations rely on a number of information technologies to manage, store and support business activities. We have a number of systems, processes and practices in place that are designed to protect against the failure of our systems. We recognize the increasing volume of cyber attacks and employ commercially practical efforts to provide reasonable assurance that risks of such attacks are appropriately mitigated. Despite our efforts to protect sensitive and confidential information and personal data, including our employees' personal information, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations. Our systems and those of our service providers are vulnerable to circumstances beyond our reasonable control including acts of terror, acts of government, natural disasters, civil unrest and denial of service attacks which may lead to the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information and production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential or protected personal information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees, lead to claims against us and ultimately harm our business. Additionally, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.
Changes in privacy laws, regulations and standards may cause our business to suffer. 
Personal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the United States, Europe and in many other jurisdictions where we offer our products. The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Federal, state, or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the 
 14

past adopted and may in the future adopt, laws and regulations affecting data privacy. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with privacy and data securities laws, rules and regulations. Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable privacy and data security laws, rules and regulations could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit our sales and adversely affect our business.
If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be harmed. 
We own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets and are a party to licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position. Notwithstanding our intellectual property portfolio, our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Various patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws provide limited protection and may not prevent our competitors from duplicating our products or gaining access to our proprietary information. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them.
On occasion, we may assert claims against third parties who are taking actions that we believe are infringing our intellectual property rights. Similarly, third parties may assert claims against us and our customers and distributors alleging our products infringe upon third party intellectual property rights. These claims, regardless of their merit or resolution, are frequently costly to prosecute, defend or settle and divert the efforts and attention of our management and employees. Claims of this sort also could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. If any such claim were to result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to take actions which may include: expending significant resources to develop or license non-infringing products, paying substantial damages to third parties, including to customers to compensate them for their discontinued use or replacing infringing technology with non-infringing technology or cessation of the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products. Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or our competitive position. 
We are subject to risks associated with changing manufacturing technologies, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage. 
The successful implementation of our business strategy requires us to continuously evolve our existing products and introduce new products to meet customers’ needs. Our products are characterized by stringent performance and specification requirements that mandate a high degree of manufacturing and engineering expertise. If we fail to meet these requirements, our business could be at risk. We believe that our customers rigorously evaluate their suppliers on the basis of a number of factors, including: 

• | product quality;


• | technical expertise, product design and development capability;


• | new product innovation;


• | reliability and timeliness of delivery;


• | price competitiveness;


• | manufacturing expertise;


• | operational flexibility;


• | global production capabilities;


• | financial viability;


• | customer service; and


• | overall management.

Our success will depend on our ability to continue to meet our customers’ changing specifications with respect to these criteria. We may not be able to address technological advances or introduce new products that may be necessary to remain competitive within our businesses. Furthermore, we may not be able to adequately protect any of our own technological developments to produce a sustainable competitive advantage.
The loss of our executive officers or key employees may materially harm operations and the ability to manage the day-to-day aspects of our business. 
Our future performance substantially depends on our ability to retain and motivate executive officers and key employees. Our ability to manage the day-to-day aspects of our business may be materially harmed with the loss of any of our executive 
 15

officers or key employees, many of whom have many years of experience with us and within the automotive industry and other manufacturing industries, or if we are unable to recruit qualified personnel. The loss of the services of executive officers or key employees, who also have strong personal ties with customers and suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
We are involved from time to time in legal proceedings, claims or investigations, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
We are involved from time to time in legal proceedings, claims or investigations that could be significant. Such claims typically arise in the normal course of our business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, including disputes with suppliers, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, environmental issues, tax matters and employment matters. If any such claims were to escalate beyond our historical experience with such claims, those claims could result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
We are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and the cost of complying, or our failure to comply with such requirements, may materially harm our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment, the management, use, processing, handling, storage, transport or disposal of hazardous waste materials, or otherwise relating to the protection of public and employee health, safety and the environment. These laws and regulations expose us to liability for the environmental condition of our current facilities, and also may expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions that were not in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken or that resulted in contamination. These laws and regulations also may expose us to liability for claims of personal injury or property damage related to alleged exposure to hazardous or toxic materials. Despite our intentions to comply with all such laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that we will at all times be in compliance with all such requirements. The cost of complying with these requirements may also increase substantially in future years. If we violate or fail to comply with these requirements, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and may become more stringent over time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Our failure to maintain and comply with environmental permits that we are required to maintain could result in fines or penalties or other sanctions and have a material adverse effect on our operations or results. Future events, such as new environmental regulations or changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies, newly discovered information or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of products or business activities, may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.
The costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters could be material, and such costs, charges and liabilities could exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial statements.
We are subject to risks associated with our use of highly specialized machinery that cannot be easily replaced. 
Our machinery and tooling are complex, cannot be easily replicated and have a long lead-time to manufacture. If there is a breakdown in such machinery and tooling, and we or our service providers are unable to repair in a timely fashion, obtaining replacement machinery or rebuilding tooling could involve significant delays and costs, and may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all. Any disruption or damage to our machinery could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
New tariffs and other trade measures could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
The current U.S. administration has expressed strong concerns about imports from countries that it perceives as engaging in unfair trade practices, and it is possible the administration could impose import duties or other restrictions on products, components or raw materials sourced from those countries, which may include countries from which we import components or raw materials. Any such import duties or restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, these new tariffs, or other changes in U.S. trade policy, could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries. Certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods. Other foreign governments are considering the imposition of sanctions that will deny U.S. companies access to critical raw materials. A “trade war” of this nature or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the economic environments in which we operate and, thus, to adversely impact our businesses.
 16

In addition, there may be changes to existing trade agreements, like NAFTA and its anticipated successor agreement, the USMCA, which is still subject to approval by the United States, Mexico and Canada, greater restrictions on free trade generally, and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly tariffs on products manufactured in Mexico, among other possible changes. It remains unclear what the U.S. administration or foreign governments, will or will not do with respect to tariffs, NAFTA, USMCA or other international trade agreements and policies. Any changes to NAFTA (or subsequent trade agreements) could impact our operations in countries where we manufacture or sell products or source components, or materials, which could adversely affect our operating results and our business.
Changes in tax laws may adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. The U.S. enacted significant tax reform at the beginning of 2018, and certain provisions of the reformed law may adversely affect us. In addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. If U.S. or foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted.
Impairment charges relating to our goodwill or long lived assets could adversely affect our financial performance.
Goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Generally accepted accounting principles require that goodwill be periodically evaluated for impairment. As of October 31, 2019, we had $22,395 of goodwill, or 3.4% of our total assets, that could be subject to impairment. Declines in our profitability or the value of comparable companies may impact the fair value which could result in a write-down of goodwill and a reduction of net income. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of these assets, changes in the structure of our business, divestitures, market capitalization declines, or increases in associated discount rates may impair our long lived assets. Any charges relating to impairments of goodwill or long lived assets may adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized.
Oak Tree Holdings LLC may exercise significant influence over us. 
Oak Tree Holdings LLC and its affiliates owned 31% of our common stock as of October 31, 2019. As a result, Oak Tree Holdings LLC and its affiliates, which includes a member of the Company's Board of Directors, have significant influence over the vote in any election of directors and thereby the board of directors' policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our common stock, the incurrence of debt by us, amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws and the entering into of extraordinary transactions, and Oak Tree Holdings LLC's and its affiliates' interests may not in all cases be aligned with other stakeholders' interests. In addition, Oak Tree Holdings LLC and its affiliates may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to us or be opposed by other stockholders. 
Changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods.
Our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material and may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and our financial position. A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including: (1) the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed, (2) the resolution of issues arising from any current and future tax audits with various tax authorities, (3) changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, (4) increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including transaction costs, restructuring costs and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions, (5) changes in the taxation of share-based compensation, (6) changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws, and changes in generally accepted accounting principles, (7) expiration of or lapses in the research and development tax credit laws and (8) challenges to the transfer pricing policies related to our structure.
 17

Certain liabilities of our pension plans are underfunded and we have unfunded post-retirement benefit obligations. Additional cash contributions we may be required to make to our pension plans or amounts we may be required to pay in respect of post-retirement benefit obligations will reduce the cash available for our business. 
A certain number of our employees in the United States are participants in defined benefit pension plans which we sponsor. As of October 31, 2019, the unfunded amount of our U.S. pension plans was $22.6 million. While future benefit accruals under our U.S. defined benefit plans were frozen, we may have ongoing obligations to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans as required in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, we sponsor unfunded post-retirement benefits for a limited number of employees. As of October 31, 2019, the unfunded amount for these post-retirement benefits was $0.3 million. Cash contributions to these plans and payment of these post-retirement benefit obligations will reduce the cash available for our business. Under ERISA, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”) has the authority to petition a court to terminate an underfunded defined benefit pension plan under limited circumstances. In the event our pension plans are terminated by the PBGC, we could be liable to the PBGC for the entire amount of the underfunding, as calculated by the PBGC based on its own assumptions (which likely would result in a larger obligation than that based on the assumptions it has used to fund such plans).
We may incur material costs related to plant closings, which could materially harm our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
If we must close manufacturing facilities because of lost business or consolidation of manufacturing facilities, the employee termination costs, asset retirements and other exit costs associated with the closure of these facilities may be significant. In certain circumstances, we may close a manufacturing facility that is operated under a lease agreement and we may continue to incur material costs in accordance with the lease agreement. We attempt to align production capacity with demand; however, we cannot provide assurance that plants will not have to be closed.
Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting or remediate weaknesses could materially harm our revenues and trading price of the common stock. If we cannot accurately report financial results, stockholder confidence in our ability to pursue business and maintain the trading price of our common stock may be eroded. 
An effective internal control system, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention or overriding of controls and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to reliable financial reporting and preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent internal control limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud.
