ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Overview
Graphic Packaging Holding Company (“GPHC” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) is committed to providing consumer packaging that makes a world of difference. The Company is a leading provider of sustainable, fiber-based packaging solutions for a wide variety of products to food, beverage, foodservice and other consumer products companies. The Company operates on a global basis, is one of the largest producers of folding cartons in the United States ("U.S.") and Europe, and holds leading market positions in coated recycled paperboard ("CRB"), coated unbleached kraft paperboard (“CUK”) and solid bleached sulfate paperboard ("SBS").
The Company’s customers include many of the world’s most widely recognized companies and brands with prominent market positions in beverage, food, foodservice and other consumer products. The Company strives to provide its customers with innovative sustainable packaging solutions designed to deliver marketing and performance benefits at a competitive cost by capitalizing on its low-cost paperboard mills and converting plants, its proprietary carton and packaging designs, and its commitment to quality and service.
On January 1, 2018, GPHC, a Delaware corporation, International Paper Company, a New York corporation (“IP”), Graphic Packaging International Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formerly known as Gazelle Newco LLC and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“GPIP”), and Graphic Packaging International, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formerly known as Graphic Packaging International, Inc. and a direct subsidiary of GPIP (“GPIL”), completed a series of transactions pursuant to an agreement dated October 23, 2017, among the foregoing parties (the “Transaction Agreement”). Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement (i) a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company transferred its ownership interest in GPIL to GPIP; (ii) IP transferred its North America Consumer Packaging (“NACP”) business to GPIP, which was then subsequently transferred to GPIL; (iii) GPIP issued membership interests to IP, and IP was admitted as a member of GPIP; and (iv) GPIL assumed certain indebtedness of IP (the "NACP Combination").
During 2020, GPIP purchased 32.5 million partnership units from IP for $500 million in cash, fully redeeming the 18.2 million partnership units that were required to be redeemed in cash. On February 16, 2021, the Company announced that IP had notified the Company of its intent to exchange additional partnership units. Per an agreement between the parties, on February 19, 2021, GPIP purchased 9.3 million partnership units from IP for $150 million in cash, and IP exchanged 15.3 million partnership units for an equivalent number of shares of GPHC common stock. On May 21, 2021, IP exchanged its remaining 22.8 million partnership units for an equivalent number of shares of GPHC common stock. As required by the parties' agreement, these shares were immediately sold by IP. As a result, IP has no ownership interest remaining in GPIP as of May 21, 2021.

The Company provides a wide range of sustainable paperboard packaging solutions for the following end-use markets:
• Beverage, including beer, seltzer, soft drinks, energy drinks, teas, water and juices;
• Food, including cereal, desserts, frozen, refrigerated and microwavable foods, pet food and health/beauty;
• Prepared food and drinks, including snacks, quick-serve food and drinks for restaurants and food service providers; 
• Household products, including dishwasher and laundry detergent, health care and beauty aids, and tissues and papers; and
• Air filter frames.
The Company’s packaging applications meet the needs of its customers for: 
Strength Packaging. The Company's products provide sturdiness to meet a variety of packaging, handling, and delivery needs, including tear and wet strength, puncture resistance, durability and compression strength (providing the ability to ship products in their own branded carton and stacking strength to meet store display packaging requirements).
Promotional Packaging. The Company offers a broad range of promotional packaging options that help differentiate its customers’ products in the marketplace. These promotional enhancements improve brand awareness and visibility on store shelves.
Convenience and Cooking Packaging. These packaging solutions improve package usage and food preparation:
• Beverage multiple-packaging — multi-packs for beer, soft drinks, energy drinks, teas, water and juices;
• Active microwave technologies — packages that improve the heating and browning of foods in the microwave; and
• Easy opening and closing features — dispensing features, pour spouts and sealable liners.
Barrier Packaging. The Company provides packages that protect against moisture, temperature (hot and cold), grease, oil, oxygen, sunlight, insects and other potential product-damaging factors.
Paperboard Mills and Folding Carton Facilities
The Company produces paperboard at its mills; prints, cuts, folds, and glues (“converts”) the paperboard into folding cartons and containers at its converting plants; and designs and manufactures specialized, proprietary packaging machines that package bottles and cans and, to a lesser extent, non-beverage consumer products. The Company also installs its packaging machines at customer plants and provides support, service and advanced performance monitoring of the machines.
The Company offers a variety of laminated, coated and printed packaging structures that are produced from its CRB, CUK and SBS mills, as well as other grades of paperboard that are purchased from third-party suppliers.
Below is the production at each of the Company’s paperboard mills during 2021: 

Location | Product | # of Machines | 2021 Net Tons Produced
West Monroe, LA | CUK | 2 | 931,713 
Macon, GA | CUK | 2 | 738,981 
Texarkana, TX | SBS | 2 | 583,910 
Augusta, GA | SBS | 2 | 585,164 
Kalamazoo, MI | CRB | 2 | 508,546 
Battle Creek, MI | CRB | 2 | 219,058 
Middletown, OH | CRB | 1 | 178,863 
East Angus, Québec | CRB | 1 | 99,568 

The Company consumes most of its coated board output in its converting operations, which is an integral part of the customer value proposition. In 2021, approximately 72% of combined mill sales of CRB, CUK and SBS was consumed internally.
CUK Production. The Company is the largest of four worldwide producers of CUK. CUK is manufactured from pine-based wood fiber and is a specialized high-quality grade of coated paperboard with excellent wet and dry tear strength characteristics and printability for high resolution graphics that make it particularly well-suited for a variety of packaging applications. Both wood and recycled fibers are pulped, formed on paper machines, and clay-coated to provide an excellent printing surface for superior quality graphics and appearance characteristics.
SBS Production. The Company is one of the largest North American producers of SBS. SBS is manufactured from bleached pine and hardwood-based wood fiber and is the highest quality paperboard substrate with excellent wet and dry strength characteristics and superior printability for high-end packaging. Both wood and recycled fibers are pulped, formed on paper machines, and clay-coated to provide an excellent printing surface for superior quality graphics and appearance characteristics. SBS is also coated with resin for wet strength liquid and food packaging end uses. 
CRB Production. The Company is the largest North American producer of CRB. CRB is manufactured entirely from recycled fibers, primarily old corrugated containers (“OCC”), doubled-lined kraft cuttings from corrugated box plants (“DLK”), old newspapers (“ONP”), and box cuttings. The recycled fibers are re-pulped, formed on paper machines, and clay-coated to provide an excellent printing surface for superior quality graphics and appearance characteristics.
The Company converts CRB, CUK and SBS, as well as other grades of paperboard, into cartons and containers at converting plants the Company operates in various locations globally, including a converting plant associated with the Company's joint venture in Japan, contract converters and at licensees outside the United States ("U.S."). The converting plants print, cut, fold and glue paperboard into cartons and containers designed to meet customer specifications.
Joint Venture
The Company, through its GPIL subsidiary, is a party to a Japanese joint venture, Rengo Riverwood Packaging, Ltd., in which it holds a 50% ownership interest. The joint venture agreement covers CUK supply, use of proprietary carton designs and marketing and distribution of packaging systems.
Sales and Marketing
The Company markets its products principally to multinational beverage, food, Quick-Service Restaurants ("QSR"), health/beauty and other well-recognized consumer product companies. The beverage companies include Anheuser-Busch, Inc., MillerCoors LLC, PepsiCo, Inc. and The Coca-Cola Company, among others. Consumer product customers include Kraft Heinz Company, General Mills, Inc., Nestlé USA, Inc., Kellogg Company, Kimberly-Clark Corporation, among others. Quick-Service Restaurants ("QSR") customers include ChickFil-A, McDonald's, Wendy's, Panda Express, Dairy Queen, Chipotle, Panera and KFC and health/beauty include GlaxoSmithKline, Bayer, Johnson & Johnson, Abbott, Novartis, L’Oréal Proctor and Gamble, and Colgate. The Company also sells paperboard in the open market to independent and integrated paperboard converters.
Sales of the Company’s principal products is primarily accomplished through sales offices in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and, to a lesser degree, through broker arrangements with third parties.
During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have any one customer that represented 10% or more of its net sales.
Competition
Although a relatively small number of large competitors hold a significant portion of the paperboard packaging market, the Company’s business is subject to strong competition. The Company and WestRock Company ("WestRock") are the two major CUK producers in the U.S. Internationally, The Klabin Company in Brazil and Stora Enso in Sweden produce similar grades of paperboard.
In non-beverage consumer packaging and foodservice, the Company’s paperboard competes with WestRock's CUK, as well as CRB and SBS from numerous competitors, and, internationally, folding boxboard and white-lined chip. There are a large number of producers in the paperboard markets. Suppliers of paperboard compete primarily on the basis of price, strength and printability of their paperboard, quality and service.
In beverage packaging, cartons made from CUK compete with substitutes such as plastics and corrugated packaging for packaging glass or plastic bottles, cans and other primary containers. Although plastics and corrugated packaging may be priced lower than CUK, the Company believes that cartons made from CUK offer advantages over these materials in areas such as distribution, brand awareness, carton designs, package performance, package line speed, sustainability (particularly recyclability) and design flexibility.
Raw Materials
The paperboard packaging produced by the Company comes from pine and hardwood trees and recycled fibers. Pine pulpwood, hardwood pulp, paper and recycled fibers (including DLK, OCC and ONP) and energy used in the manufacture of paperboard, as well as poly sheeting, plastic resins and various chemicals used in the coating of paperboard, represent the largest components of the Company’s variable costs of paperboard production.
For the West Monroe, LA, Macon, GA, Texarkana, TX, and Augusta, GA mills, the Company relies on private landowners and the open market for all of its pine and hardwood pulp and recycled fiber requirements, supplemented by clippings that are obtained from its converting operations. The Company believes that adequate supplies from both private landowners and open market fiber sellers currently are available in close proximity to meet its fiber needs at these mills.
The paperboard grades produced at the Kalamazoo, MI, Battle Creek, MI, Middletown, OH, and East Angus, Quebec mills are made from 100% recycled fiber. The Company procures its recycled fiber from external suppliers and internal converting operations. The market price of each of the various recycled fiber grades fluctuates with supply and demand. The Company’s internal recycled fiber procurement function enables the Company to pay lower prices for its recycled fiber needs given the Company’s highly fragmented supplier base. The Company believes there are adequate supplies of recycled fiber to serve its mills.
In North America, the Company also converts a variety of other paperboard grades, in addition to paperboard that is supplied to its converting operations from its own mills. The Company purchases such paperboard requirements, including additional CRB and SBS, from outside vendors. The majority of external paperboard purchases are acquired through long-term arrangements with other major industry suppliers. The Company's European converting plants consume CUK supplied from the Company's mills and also convert other paperboard grades such as white-lined chip and folding box board purchased from external suppliers.
Energy
Energy, including natural gas, fuel, oil and electricity, represents a significant portion of the Company’s manufacturing and distribution costs. The Company has entered into contracts designed to manage risks associated with future variability in cash flows and price risk related to future energy cost increases for a portion of its natural gas requirements at its U.S. mills. The Company’s hedging program for natural gas is discussed in "Note 10 - Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Hedging Activities" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under “Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Seasonality
The Company’s net sales, income from operations and cash flows from operations are subject to moderate seasonality, with demand usually increasing in the late spring through early fall due to increases in demand for beverage and food products. 
Research and Development
The Company’s research and development team works directly with its sales, marketing and consumer insights personnel to understand long-term consumer and retailer trends and create relevant new packaging. These innovative solutions provide customers with differentiated packaging to meet consumer preferences. The Company’s development efforts include, but are not limited to, developing sustainable packaging to replace plastic packaging, extending the shelf life of customers’ products; reducing production and waste costs; enhancing the heat-managing characteristics of food packaging; improving the sturdiness and compression strength of packaging to allow goods to ship in their own branded container and to meet store display needs; and refining packaging appearance through new printing techniques and materials.
Sustainability represents one of the strongest trends in the packaging industry and the Company focuses on developing fiber-based packaging solutions that are more recyclable and help customers achieve their sustainability goals. The Company’s strategy is to combine functionality, innovation of packaging design with a focus on packaging end of life to create more circular packaging solutions for customers and consumers. 
For more information on research and development expenses see "Note 1 - Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under “Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Patents and Trademarks
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a large patent portfolio, presently owning, controlling or holding rights to more than 2,700 U.S. and foreign patents, with more than 600 U.S. and foreign patent applications currently pending. The Company’s patent portfolio consists primarily of patents relating to packaging machinery, manufacturing methods, structural carton designs, active microwave packaging technology and barrier protection packaging. These patents and processes are significant to the Company’s operations and are supported by trademarks such as Fridge Vendor™, IntegraPak™, KeelClip™, MicroFlex-Q™, MicroRite™, Quilt Wave™, Qwik Crisp™, Tite-Pak™, and Z-Flute™. The Company takes significant steps to protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights. 
Human Capital
We believe that the Company’s greatest asset is our workforce. Solving day-to-day operational and business challenges in order to drive positive results for stakeholders requires attracting, developing, and retaining talented individuals with different skills, ideas, and experiences. Our Vision 2025 outlines how we will be better stewards of our planet, supporters of our people, and allies to our partners, all while generating returns for our stakeholders. Our employees play a crucial role in achieving our Vision 2025 and are guided by our shared values and growth behaviors.
Our people are one of the pillars of our Vision 2025 and we strive to engage employees in a high-performance culture. In order to achieve this, we must attract, develop, and retain our talented workforce by providing opportunities for growth and a conducive atmosphere. Our talent acquisition, development, succession and diversity and inclusion strategies are all critical components of the multi-year plan for our people. We will continue to invest in capability development areas that serve as a competitive advantage for the Company such as GPI University, which launched in 2021 and serves as a platform for all employees to access relevant training and development resources on topics related to technical skills and leadership effectiveness. Also, central to capability development and talent management is challenging our team with new experiences that will enhance their leadership skills and technical capabilities. We will also continuously improve our processes and use technology to promote safety, automate our manufacturing processes, and achieve greater efficiencies utilizing processes such as Lean Six Sigma. 
We are evolving the capabilities of our workforce as our business and strategy change. We have invested in innovation, research and development, and digital capabilities to allow us to capture sustainability supported organic growth. As our business continues to change, we will adapt our workforce and invest in employees to ensure that we have the necessary human capital capabilities in place to support our strategy.
 As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 25,000 employees worldwide based in 130 locations in 26 different countries around the world. Approximately 69% of our employees are in the United States and 31% are in Europe and rest of world. Worldwide, approximately 32% were represented by labor unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements or covered by works councils in Europe. As of December 31, 2021, 541 of the Company’s employees were working under expired contracts, which are currently being negotiated, and none were covered under collective bargaining agreements that expire within one year. The Company considers its employee relations to be satisfactory.
Employee Health and Safety
Maintaining a safe work environment is vital to the Company, and we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. Our Recorded Incident Rate, which is the rate of workplace injuries per 100 full-time employees, is approximately 1.18, and we work to maintain a safety performance rating that outperforms the industry average. We seek to achieve an injury-free workplace through various safety initiatives and programs. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, while continuing to service our customers. We quickly implemented remote working, enhanced safety measures for employees continuing critical, on-site work at our facilities such as walk-through temperature scanners, plexiglass barriers between employees, and other methods of encouraging social distancing, and paid employees during necessary quarantines due to COVID-19. We will continue to monitor local COVID-19 conditions and adjust our practices to ensure the health and safety of our employees.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that a diverse and inclusive working environment encourages creativity, innovation, and collaboration and that a diverse and inclusive culture propels our ability to serve our global customers and communities. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is reflected in the definitions of our core values, which dictate our behavioral norms. The Compensation and Management Development Committee of our Board of Directors annually reviews the processes and practices related to workforce diversity and inclusion programs to ensure continued equitable treatment of all employees and a culture of inclusion. Our goal moving forward is to not only mirror the diversity of the communities where we operate, but also to excel in unlocking the potential that a diverse workforce can generate.
Community Engagement
Building connections between our employees, their families, and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. Our employees around the world dedicate their time and talents to improve the communities in which we live and work. Driven by our core values, making a difference for our customers, our consumers, and our community is at the root of our community engagement strategy. The Company focuses on three pillars that guide the strategy for our community service activities and philanthropic commitments: (1) putting food on the table, (2) preserving the environment, and (3) investing in education.
Environmental and Regulatory Matters
The Company is subject to a broad range of foreign, federal, state and local environmental, employee health and safety, and other governmental regulations and employs a team of professionals in order to maintain compliance at each of its facilities. In 2021, the Company spent $9 million of capital on projects to maintain compliance with environmental laws, regulations and the Company’s permits granted thereunder. In 2022 and 2023, the Company estimates it will spend $10 million and $47 million respectively, for such projects, primarily the waste water treatment system upgrades at the Augusta, Georgia and Texarkana, Texas mills. For additional information on such regulation and compliance, see “Environmental Matters” in “Item 7., Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and "Note 14 - Environmental and Legal Matters" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under “Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Climate change is an important global issue that presents both challenges and opportunities for the Company and its communities. Climate change challenges for the Company are likely to be driven by changes in the physical climate where our facilities are located as well as changes in laws and regulations, including restrictions on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, cap and trade systems, and taxes on GHG emissions, fuel, and energy. Climate change also presents opportunities for the Company as it drives growth in demand for lower-carbon footprint products and manufacturing technologies. We believe the Company is well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from increased consumer demand for and/or legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of products and technologies necessary to achieve a lower-carbon, lower-waste economy. Our costs of complying with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as voluntary certification and disclosure programs, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. These laws and regulations and stakeholder driven voluntary certification and disclosure programs could become more stringent over time, which could result in significant additional compliance costs. Additionally, significant national or state differences in the imposition and enforcement of such laws and regulations could present competitive challenges in a global marketplace. By tracking and taking action to reduce our GHG emissions and energy use through efficiency programs and focused GHG management efforts, we can decrease the potential future impact of these regulatory matters. 
The Company’s Core Values underpin our commitment to our stakeholders and our strategy to deliver sustainable, recyclable packaging solutions. Our Vision 2025 outlines our plans for how we will grow the Company and the returns we expect to generate, all while prioritizing and focusing on our people and the planet. These goals are designed to position us for sustainably-achieved, long-term earnings growth.
