McKesson Specialty Health (“MSH”)

This business is focused on three core business lines: Manufacturer Solutions, Practice Management and Provider Solutions.

McKESSON CORPORATION

Manufacturer Solutions: This business helps manufacturers accelerate the approval and successful commercialization of specialty pharmaceuticals across the product life cycle. Our offerings include supply chain services, including specialty pharmacy services and third-party logistics (“3PL”), provider and patient engagement programs, clinical trial support, patient assistance programs, reimbursement services and analytics. In addition, we help manufacturers minimize reimbursement challenges while offering affordable, safe access to therapies through Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) programs.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our acquisition of RxCrossroads, a provider of tailored services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers. RxCrossroads is headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky. This acquisition enhances our end-to-end solutions for manufacturers of branded, specialty, generic and biosimilar drugs, including comprehensive patient support services, custom pharmacy solutions and third-party logistics. In addition, this acquisition will add plasma logistics to our manufacturer solutions, complementing the Company’s established customer-facing plasma offerings. This is a continuation of our strategy to achieve better patient outcomes through efficiency and coordination across the supply chain, and throughout the patient journey. 
Practice Management: This business provides a variety of solutions, including practice operations, healthcare information technology, revenue cycle management and managed care contracting solutions, evidence-based guidelines and quality measurements to support U.S. Oncology Network, one of the nation’s largest networks of physician-led, integrated, community-based oncology practices dedicated to advancing high-quality, evidence-based cancer care. We also support U.S. Oncology Research, one of the nation’s largest research networks, specializing in oncology clinical trials.
Provider Solutions: This business offers community specialists (oncologists, rheumatologists, ophthalmologists, urologists, neurologists and other specialists) an extensive set of customizable products and services designed to strengthen core practice operations, enhance value-based care delivery and expand their service offering to patients. Tools and services include specialty drug distribution and group purchasing organization (“GPO”) services, technology solutions, practice consulting services, and vaccine distribution, including our exclusive distributor relationship with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (“CDC”) Vaccines for Children program. Community-based physicians in this business line have broad flexibility and discretion to select the products and commitment levels that best meet their practice needs. In the second quarter of 2018, we acquired intraFUSION, Inc. (“intraFUSION”) of Houston, Texas, which provides management services to physician office infusion centers. 
When we classify a pharmaceutical product or service as “specialty,” we consider the following factors: diseases requiring complex treatment regimens such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis; plasma and biologics products; ongoing clinical monitoring requirements, high-cost, special handling, storage and delivery requirements and, in some cases, exclusive distribution arrangements. Our use of the term “specialty” to define a portion of our distribution business may not be comparable to that used by other industry participants, including our competitors.
McKesson Canada
McKesson Canada is one of the largest wholesale distributors and pharmacy retailers in Canada.
The wholesale business delivers their products to retail pharmacies, hospitals, long-term care centers, clinics and institutions in Canada through a network of 13 distribution centers and provides logistics and distribution services for manufacturers. Beyond wholesale pharmaceutical logistics and distribution, McKesson Canada provides automation solutions to its retail and hospital customers.

Through specialty solutions and services, McKesson Canada works with health care providers, manufacturers and payers to help patients with complex diseases by improving access to life-saving treatments.

We serve our customers across the continuum of care to help improve efficiencies, profitability and compliance while promoting better patient outcomes.

McKESSON CORPORATION

Equity investment in Change Healthcare: 
On March 1, 2017, we finalized a contribution agreement (“Contribution Agreement”) with Change Healthcare Holdings, Inc. (“Change”), a Delaware corporation, and others including shareholders of Change to form a joint venture, Change Healthcare. Under the terms of the Contribution Agreement, we contributed the majority of our McKesson Technology Solutions businesses (“Core MTS Business”) to Change Healthcare. In exchange for the contribution, we own approximately 70% of the joint venture with the remaining equity ownership held by Change shareholders. We retained our RelayHealth Pharmacy (“RHP”) and EIS businesses. Our investment in Change Healthcare is accounted for using the equity method of accounting.  Change Healthcare is a healthcare technology company that leverages software and analytics, network solutions, and technology-enabled services to enable better patient care, choice, and outcomes at scale. We transferred our RHP business to our MDS segment, effective April 1, 2017.
Refer to Financial Note 2, “Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
EIS: 
This business provided clinical and financial information systems for healthcare organizations including professional services, workflow management and supply chain management solutions.  
On October 2, 2017, we sold our EIS business to a third party. We received net cash proceeds of $169 million after $16 million of assumed net debt by the third party. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $109 million (after-tax gain of $30 million) upon the disposition of this business in the third quarter of 2018. 
Fiscal 2019 Operating Segments
As previously disclosed in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, the executive who was our segment manager of the Distribution Solutions segment retired from the Company in January 2018. As a result, the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) evaluated our management and operating structure. In connection with the completion of this evaluation in the first quarter of 2019, our operating structure is realigned, and we will report our financial results in three reportable segments on a retrospective basis commencing in the first quarter of 2019: U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, European Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions. All remaining operating segments and business activities that are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure will be included in Other. Other primarily consists of McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions and our equity method investment in Change Healthcare. The segment changes will reflect how our CODM allocates resources and assesses performance commencing in the first quarter of 2019. Refer to Financial Note 28, “Segments of Business” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Business Combinations, Investments, Discontinued Operations and Divestitures
We have undertaken additional strategic initiatives in recent years designed to further focus on our core healthcare businesses and enhance our competitive position. We expect to continue to undertake such strategic initiatives in the future. These initiatives are detailed in Financial Notes 2, 5, 6 and 7, “Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange,” “Divestitures,” “Business Combinations” and “Discontinued Operations” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
Our two reportable segments, Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions, face highly competitive global environments with strong competition from international, national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty distributors, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chain drug stores, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations.  In addition, these segments face competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment, which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment. In all areas, key competitive factors include price, quality of service, breadth of product lines, innovation and, in some cases, convenience to the customer.

McKESSON CORPORATION

Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses
McKesson and its subsidiaries hold patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets related to McKesson products and services. We pursue patent protection for our innovation, and obtain copyrights covering our original works of authorship, when such protection is advantageous. Through these efforts, we have developed a portfolio of patents and copyrights in the U.S. and worldwide. In addition, we have registered or applied to register certain trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in foreign countries.
We believe that, in the aggregate, McKesson’s confidential information, patents, copyrights, and trademarks are important to its operations and market position, but we do not consider any of our businesses to be dependent upon any one patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, or any family or families of the same. We cannot guarantee that our intellectual property portfolio will be sufficient to deter misappropriation, theft, or misuse of our technology, nor that we can successfully enjoin infringers. We periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third party patents and other intellectual property rights. These claims may result in McKesson entering settlement agreements, paying damages, discontinuing use or sale of accused products, or ceasing other activities. While the outcome of any litigation or dispute is inherently uncertain, we do not believe that the resolution of any of these infringement notices would have a material adverse impact on our results of operation. 
We hold inbound licenses for certain intellectual property that is used internally, and in some cases, utilized in McKesson’s products or services. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our operations and products and services are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with any third party.
Other Information about the Business
Customers: During 2018, sales to our ten largest customers, including GPOs accounted for approximately 51.7% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Health (“CVS”), accounted for approximately 19.9% of our total consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2018, trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 24.9% of total trade accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVS were approximately 16.4% of total trade accounts receivable. We also have agreements with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. The accounts receivable balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. Substantially all of these revenues and accounts receivable are included in our Distribution Solutions segment. 
Suppliers: We obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers, none of which accounted for more than 6% of our purchases in 2018. The loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are generally sound. The ten largest suppliers in 2018 accounted for approximately 41% of our purchases. 
A significant portion of our distribution arrangements with the manufacturers provides us compensation based on a percentage of our purchases. In addition, we have certain distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflation-based compensation component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices. For these manufacturers, a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases, as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us, could have an adverse impact on our gross profit margin.
Research and Development: Research and development (“R&D”) costs were $125 million, $341 million and $392 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016. Development expenditures in 2017 and 2016 were primarily incurred by our MTS segment. R&D costs were lower in 2018 due to the 2017 contribution of the majority of our MTS businesses. Additional information regarding our development activities is included in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Environmental Regulation: Our operations are subject to regulations under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if in the future we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws.

McKESSON CORPORATION

We are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business. We meet this commitment through an environmental strategy and sustainability program.
We sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations. Agreements with the Environmental Protection Agency and certain states may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites. These matters are described further in Financial Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when the Company considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs. Environmental costs and accruals, including that related to our legacy chemical distribution operations, are presently not material to our operations or financial position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition, we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental matters. Other than the expected expenditures that may be required in connection with our legacy chemical distribution operations, we do not anticipate making substantial capital expenditures either for environmental issues, or to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future. The amount of our capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not material in 2018 and is not expected to be material in the next year.
Employees: On March 31, 2018, we employed approximately 78,000 employees, including approximately 20,000 part-time employees.
Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations: Certain financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations is included in Financial Note 28, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
