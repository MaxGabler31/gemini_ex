Industry Overview
 
Given the acquisitions throughout 2018 the Company has diversified and operates in a number of services that span across software, education, personal improvement and management consulting services.

Personal Improvement Industry
 
The total U.S. self-improvement market was worth $9.9 billion in 2016, constituting growth of just 4.3% since 2011. Growth was mainly hurt by weak performance in infomercials and commercial diet programs. We should see better 5.6% average yearly gains from 2016 to 2022, when the overall market value should increase to $13.2 billion.
 
Traditionally, the Baby Boomers have been the main consumers of self-improvement services. While they remain an important group, the tide is shifting. Millennials are the future for this market, but there are few young experts with the experience to serve them.
 
To cater to the younger audience, the Internet is playing a larger role in the self-improvement market. More content (such as MP3 downloads, e-books, webinars, online courses, “academies”, “universities” and “masterminds”, etc.) is being delivered online, while self-help apps are starting to take off.
 
Management Consulting Industry
 

Management consultants provide advice and assistance to organizations on strategic and organizational planning; financial planning and budgeting; marketing objectives and policies; human resource policies, practices and planning; production scheduling; and control planning. Over the five years to 2017, demand for management consulting services has increased, as stronger corporate profitability has increased global aggregate private investment. Furthermore, the emergence of China, India and other growing economies has opened new doors for consultants. Over the next five years, the industry is expected to continue expanding, but at a slower pace. Business in the United States will continue to grow, but sluggish corporate profit growth may slow overall industry growth. Meanwhile emerging economies are expected to hire consultants to strategize amid slowing growth conditions.

Technical and Vocational Education and Training in Australia



Current Performance: Federal and state governments have introduced funding structures based on student demand which encouraged many private training organizations to enter this industry. Industry revenue is expected to grow by an annualized 1.3% over the five years through 2016-17, to $8.8 billion. Profitability has grown significantly over the past five years, responding changes in government funding and student demand, and aggressive advertising by industry providers. Increasing funding has incentivized existing firms to expand, which caused an upswing in establishment numbers over the past five years.

12
--

 

Market Trends: Despite the largest state governments significantly cutting funding to public VET providers, recurrent government funding to the industry has increased over the past five years. This increase is mainly attributable to federal efforts to pursue VET reform. The Federal Government, in partnership with state governments, has reiterated its promise to remedy the skills shortage in Australia. As part of the National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform, the Federal Government has allocated the states and territories $1.8 billion over the five years through 2016-17, on top of $7.0 billion in base funding. This funding was offered on the condition that these governments meet several targets, such as reducing upfront costs for students and increasing private investment through loans for diplomas. The number of students accessing VET FEE-HELP rose from about from 55,000 in 2012 to more than 272,000 in 2015. VET FEE-HELP loans increased from $26.0 million in 2012 to more than $2.9 billion in 2015.
 
Private Providers: Policy changes have caused the industry to become demand-driven. These changes, along with the readily available student loans under the VET FEE-HELP scheme, have led to a significant increase in the number of private vocational education providers. Several private VET providers have pursued initial public offerings over the past five years. New Zealand based VET education Company listed on the ASX in May 2014, while Ashley Services Group and Australian Careers Network (ACN) began trading in August and December of that year, respectively.
 
Market Outlook: The Australian dollar is expected to appreciate over the next five years, potentially reducing revenue from international students. The industry is forecast to grow at an annualized 0.5% over the next five years, to reach $9.1 billion.
 

Competition
 
In Australia, technical and further education or TAFE system is largely state-based, which means that each state has developed individual vocational education and training systems. The Federal Government is encouraging reform to develop a competitive and responsive national system. While the states coordinate their own TAFE systems and are a dominant influence in the industry, they are not major players. The following section outlines the two largest TAFE systems and the institutions.

13
--

TAFE NSW
 
In New South Wales, TAFE institutes are under the control of TAFE NSW. TAFE NSW incorporates 10 institutes, which are classified in this report as 10 separate enterprises, which operate 130 campuses throughout the state. The three biggest institutes are the Western Sydney Institute, Sydney Institute and South Western Sydney Institute. TAFE NSW enrolls more than 550,000 students. TAFE NSW increased its tuition fees by an average of 9.5% in 2013 and by a further 5.7% in 2014, in response to funding cuts from the NSW Government. Combined, TAFE NSW generated $1.9 billion in revenue in 2014-15, with 71.0%
Victorian Vocational Education and Training System
 
The Victorian style of management is more decentralized than its counterparts in other states, with no umbrella organization. The state’s VET sector consists of 18 public TAFE institutions and more than 1,300 private providers. In Victoria, four universities also offer TAFE-level courses: RMIT University, Victoria University of Technology and Swinburne University in Melbourne, and Federation University in Ballarat, VIC.
