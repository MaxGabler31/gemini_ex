Description of the Business 
  
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 24th, 2016. Our general business plan is to be actively engaged in providing high impact internet marketing to internet based businesses and small businesses seeking to create websites and provide better search engine optimization (SEO) software and techniques to small internet based businesses and people seeking to create websites. We believe that there is a niche in this area as smaller companies are not coveted by the big internet advertising firms and they cannot afford to pay the higher fees demanded by large SEO web design companies. We will also design and develop mobile applications for ourselves and customers on the iOS, Android and Windows phones platforms.  Our ability to obtain the necessary financing to complete the development of the application and to become profitable is dependent on raising money in the future.  On October 24, 2016, we appointed Ajay Rajendran to be the President, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer, and Director of the Company.  We received our initial funding of $3,000 through the sale of common stock to our President, Ajay Rajendran, who purchased 3,000,000 shares of our common stock at $0.001 per share on April 10, 2017.  We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and we have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Neither we, nor our officer, director, promoters or affiliates, have had preliminary contact or discussions with, nor do we have any present plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with, any representatives of the owners of any business or company regarding the possibility of another acquisition or merger. Since we were incorporated we have had our own website at www.belisscorp.com, have created contracts for clients, have negotiated with 5 individuals regarding the provision of services to them. Also we have discussed the terms of executing of our work. The Company is able to provide separate services of creation and designing webpages.  If a customer wants to have a unique and unrepeatable design of its webpage after development we can provide such service as well.  We currently have no employees. We plan to hire experienced employees in the future when we have sufficient revenues. Our sole directors current training allows him to provide the services we list in this report.  
The Company 
  
Business Plan 
 We will be actively engaged in providing high impact internet marketing to internet based businesses and small businesses seeking to create websites. Our services will also attempt to elevate the place of customers websites in search engine rankings for selected keywords which describe the product or service offered by the customer. The process of elevating a websites rankings is known as search engine optimization, or SEO, and it involves the use of keywords and algorithms for relevant content.  The Company will also help customers manage their monthly advertising expenditures through pay-per-click, or PPC advertising which allows business owners to immediately appear on the first page of a web search. By using pay-per-click, a company can automatically increase the presence of its website; we feel that this avenue of growth to a new business can be very important, as the business will be able to generate highly predictable advertising fees on a month to month basis for these services. We will also, provide customers with the web application development services for many different computing needs. The primary focus of these services is the development of websites using different types of templates such as: HTML, Word Press, MotoCMS HTML and OpenCart. When we design and create a website and marketing campaign for a customer we believe we are building an online identity for that customer and thereby allowing the formation of a potential consumer audience wishing to purchase that customers product or service. We will discuss and work with the customer to establish a brand identity that clearly communicates our customers core values as well as making it instantly recognizable.

Once we have established our web design, advertising and SEO portion of our business we will also design and develop mobile applications for ourselves and customers on the iOS, Android and Windows phones platforms.  
Products & Services 
  
Website Development 
  
We plan the primary revenue creator for our business to be the development of website applications including customized websites for small to medium sized businesses. Within this aspect of the business, the Company will charge from $500 for each project undertaken by the Company. Customers that use our services will be seeking to develop an expansive ecommerce, or application intensive website. Through our areas of expertise, we will be able to provide small, and medium sized businesses with enterprise level applications customizable for any purpose.  Internet Marketing 
  
Our secondary revenue stream for the Company will be our marketing and advertising services. We will help customers manage their monthly advertising expenditures through pay-per-click advertising which allows business owners to immediately appear on the first page of a web search and control the advertising costs by setting a maximum budget per month. By using pay per-click, a company can automatically increase the presence of its website, by attracting internet viewers who are interested in the product or service that the customer provides. Pay-per-click advertising to a new business can be very important, as the business will be able to generate highly predictable advertising fees on a month to month basis for these services and attract potential customers. We will also assist companies with email and traditional advertising campaigns. We will help build emails that the customer can send to its client lists to update them on upcoming events and sales, and in that way can make sure that the customer can keep in touch with its clients.  Search Engine Optimization (SEO) 
  
We also intend on providing search engine optimization services. This service works by examining the keywords of any given website, and then applying these keywords to search engines that the Company enrolls its customers in. This service provides users with the ability to appear on the direct search engine results for their selected keywords. The search engine optimization service is almost invisible. In the process of writing the website (back end) thematic tags are included, which in turn make searching process for webpages or websites of the customers easier. Our sole officers Ajay Rajendran is currently providing the companys services and discloses his current level of relevant training. Search engines such as Google, Yahoo, MSN, Ask.com, and many others use complicated algorithms to rank specific websites based on their relevance to the keyword. By adding keyword rich content to a website, the Company will be able to proactively increase the clients websites visibility by integrating their keywords into these search directories. The technical aspect behind SEO service is highly complex, and management will provide a potential client with a technical specification document outlining the structure of how these services are rendered.   
Branding and visual representation 
  
We will also build an identity for our customers. When designing a companys website and online brand we understand and take care in the knowledge that we are forming a potential audience who will want to purchase a product or service from our customer. We will research and discuss with our customer what they want to portray to their customers and then establish a brand identity that clearly communicates those customer core values as well as making our customers business instantly recognizable.  
Mobile Apps 
  
Design and develop mobile smartphone applications for ourselves and for clients on the iOS, Android and Windows phones platforms.   
Sales and Marketing 
  
We believe that the most effective and efficient marketing channel for us, is through the internet, smartphone ads and by word of mouth. Online or internet marketing is comparatively more cost-effective than traditional local and print media marketing campaigns. Although, the Company will emphasize its advertising on internet marketing channels, we will not ignore other effective marketing tools also, such as word of mouth marketing, smartphone ads and possibly billboards, radio or television spots.  
    5  
    
Beliss Corp. intends to maintain an extensive marketing campaign that will ensure maximum visibility for the business in its targeted market.  
Marketing Objectives 
  
               The company will use a variety of online marketing tools and channels including: Our website is the first step of implementing our business. Our website will be enhanced continuously as our business needs dictate.   Social media has currently proven itself the most cost-effective and efficient medium to communicate with potential customers and to get the Company name and services noticed by potential customers. Due to the popularity of social media we will also use all sources of social media marketing that are available to us. This will also allow us to show our potential clients our ability to design and create, through the use of our social media account designs and website links. We also plan on targeting local businesses by implementing a local campaign in the Companys directed market, the Chennai area, via the use of web advertising, flyers, local newspaper advertisements, word of mouth, clients recommendations and referrals. We will begin our focus for new clients in the Chennai area because there are many small businesses that are based there. We believe that with the large amount of tourism, the growing use by tourists of internet searches from computers and smartphones to search for taxis, limousines, restaurants, and souvenir shops that we will be able to assist those companies in being found by those searches, by creating their websites, and assisting them with their SEO; thereby, increasing their clientele.  Lastly we plan on establishing relationships with small businesses and through professional networking using the internet and various community meetings and trade shows. In the future, our marketing teams will create a virtual network with our potential customers. Networking will be very helpful in bringing us references of potential clients and spreading information about our web design, advertising and SEO abilities by word of mouth.  Our ability to generate advertising and referral revenue will be due in large part to our ability to get traffic to our website and social media.  Marketing Plans 
  
Mr. Rajendran intends on using a number of marketing plans that will allow Beliss Corp.to easily target people and business owners within our directed market. These ideas include social media, SEO, pay-per-click advertisements, traditional print advertisements and ads placed on search engines on the internet.  We will also use internet based advertising. This is very important because, as a web design and SEO company, we need to prove to potential customers that we are good at what we do, and one of the best ways to prove that is to have a great website that is easy to find through search engines. To further that online presence our founder, Mr. Rajendran will register the Company with online portals so that potential customers can easily reach the business. The Company will further develop its own online website: belisscorp.com  The Company will maintain print and traditional advertising methods within local markets to promote the internet and web development services that the Company is selling. The amount of that advertising that the Company is able to establish will be based on the level of revenue we generate and funding we may obtain.   Industry
  
Widespread adoption of the internet as a source for attracting prospective customers, customer relations and overall distribution of corporate message has increased the need for an online presence for businesses, from large corporations to small enterprises. Prior to the widespread adoption of the internet, content was primarily distributed through traditional media, such as newspapers, magazines and television. Increased access to the internet as a result of extensive broadband penetration and the rapid proliferation of connected mobile devices and wearable technology devices is driving significant growth in demand for online content.  As a result, there has been an exponential increase in the number of websites and mobile applications created and the amount of content available digitally. Concurrently, search technology has continued to improve the organization of and access to the broad range of websites and online information, reshaping consumer behavior and expectations for discovering credible and relevant information online.  Industry Analysis 
  
The technical consulting and web design industry has been increasing over the last five years. Rapid increases and developments in computer technology have caused the average user to rely on computer professionals to handle their web development, internet marketing, and search engine optimization needs.  As time progresses, management expect that the number of businesses operating within the web design and search engine optimization market will continue to grow as these services are heavily in demand. This segment of the computer consulting industry is relatively new as many companies have realized that in order to thrive online, an expansive marketing and advertising campaign is needed to continually draw traffic to their website. The popularity of these services has skyrocketed over the last few years as many search engines now allow for special placement among online directories. Furthermore, the use of pay per-click advertising has allowed many smaller internet businesses to thrive on the web. We will seek to capitalize on these trends by assisting companies in the design of their website, the implementation of SEO programs and by managing PPC marketing campaigns. These services will provide the Company with an ongoing stream of revenue on a month-to-month basis.

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Trends
  
The internet has fundamentally changed the consumption of media. In contrast to consumers' relatively passive consumption of traditional media, the proliferation of the internet and social media has enabled consumers to seek out and interact with content across an increasing number of competing websites. As a result, consumers are changing the way they discover content online, increasingly typing queries into web search engines to discover and access content from the millions of websites on the internet. Further, advancements in web search technology and the popularity of social media have enhanced the ability to find specific content associated with personal needs and interests, leading to migration of the consumer base away from content consumed on traditional portals.  There is constant change in the world of search engine optimization. Google, the dominant player in the search engine sphere, regularly puts out new updates to the search algorithm that makes its service so popular. Some of the most recent changes were the October 2014 updates to the Panda and Penguin content policing systems that made it clear once again that SEO marketing companies need to focus on search engine optimization that provide value to web surfers.  Search Engine Land  reports on yet another change coming down from Google: mobile will now play a bigger role when calculating a websites search engine ranking. More specifically, if a company website earns a mobile-friendly label from Google, it will gain serious points when it comes time for Googles search engine robots to catalog and rank content. Googles announcement that mobile optimized sites are being looked at favorably shouldnt come as a surprise to any search marketing company. Digital commerce is quickly moving to mobile platforms.   Pricing 
  
Every order or request is unique and individual to that customer and therefore it is not possible to define or constrain our pricing. However, as we plan on targeting small to medium size business we need to stay competitive and we will try and offer services from a very basic level of services starting at around $500 up to a much more detailed and all-encompassing level which will cost more. The final decision on what we will charge our customer will be made after a detailed consultation with the customer on their thoughts and desires and our research into the customers business. Basically cost will be determined by how complicated the assignment is and the time required for its execution.   Customer Demographics 
  
Any online business that is seeking to expand its online presence is a potential client of ours. As such, the demographic categories for these businesses is excessively large as there are hundreds of thousands of internet entrepreneurs that are seeking to acquire the same clientele as us. We are looking for any size of companies with any income, who want to improve their online presence and increase sales. We will represent client companies located around the world and in every type of business, as we pride ourselves on being able to take on any task appropriate to our resources at the time. We understand that our customers business ideas and their perspective for the future of their companies is important, and we will base our designs and creative ideas for our customer based on those principles.   Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 
  
We currently do not have any patents or trademarks; and we are not party to any license, franchise, concession, or royalty agreements or any labor contracts.   Competition 
  
The online content and media market we participate in is new, rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Competition is expected to intensify in the future as more companies enter the space. We compete for business on a number of factors including return on marketing investment, price and access to targeted audiences and quality. Competition in the online advertising and marketing industry is also highly fragmented. Our competition is any company that provides one or more of our companys core service offerings.  Our competition includes Advertising Firms, Public Relations Companies, Web Design Companies, Graphic Design Companies, and Search Engine Optimization Firms. Our competitors range in size from small, local independent firms and individuals to very large conglomerates. Such fragmentation can mean that a small business owner can employ more than one advertising and marketing agency to get a needed mix of web design and online marketing services for their desired budget. The online media marketing industry is always evolving with thousands of new competitors entering the market every year. It is becoming very difficult for companies to distinguish themselves in the market and gain new customers.           
    7  
    
In addition to competitors, many businesses are deciding to design their own websites and execute online advertising campaigns themselves, reducing the number of potential customers. There are a large number of companies that provide website templates that a business can purchase and alter easily, without the need to hire a web development company. While basic coding knowledge is needed to effectively customize a template and incorporate social management and monitoring solutions to fit an individual businesss needs, many new businesses are choosing to use an existing template versus paying for a new website design. Our Company is also subject to other competitive risks of early stage and commercial businesses generally, and of technology businesses in particular, including competing in an environment where other companies may be better financed or have more experience than the Company.  
Government Regulation
  
We are not currently subject to direct federal, state or local regulation other than regulations applicable to businesses generally or directly applicable to electronic commerce. However, the internet is increasingly popular. As a result, it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet. These laws may cover issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, content and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights and information security. Furthermore, the growth of electronic marketing may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws. Several states have proposed legislation to limit the uses of personal user information gathered online or require online services to establish privacy policies. The Federal Trade Commission has also initiated action against at least one online service regarding the manner in which personal information is collected from users and provided to third parties. We will not provide personal information regarding our users to third parties. However, the adoption of such consumer protection laws could create uncertainty in web usage and reduce the demand for our products.  We are not certain how our business may be affected by the application of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, copyrights, encryption and other intellectual property issues, taxation, libel, obscenity and export or import matters. The clear majority of such laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet. As a result, they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies. Changes in laws intended to address such issues could create uncertainty in the internet market place. Such uncertainty could reduce demand for services or increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service delivery costs.   Consumer Protection Regulation 
  
Advertising and promotional activities presented to visitors on our website or our clients websites will be subject to federal and state consumer protection laws that regulate unfair and deceptive practices. We will also be subject to various other federal and state consumer protection laws.  The FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to advertising activities and to require that the online collection, use and dissemination of data, including personal information, and the presentation of website content, comply with certain standards for notice, choice, security and access. Courts may also adopt these developing standards. In many cases, the specific limitations imposed by these standards are subject to interpretation by courts and other governmental authorities. We believe that we will be in compliance with the consumer protection standards that apply to our website, but a determination by a state or federal agency or court that any of our potential practices do not meet these standards could result in liability and adversely affect our business. New interpretations of these standards could also require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations. In addition, claims that we are violating any such standards could, even if we are not found liable, be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. In October 2009, the FTC adopted revised Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising. These Guides, which were last updated in 1980, became effective December 1, 2009. In addition to revising certain provisions regarding disclosures relating to endorsements and testimonials, the FTC clarified the Guides applicability to online and social media forums. In 2013, the FTC also revised guidance applicable to online advertising known as the Dot Com Disclosures, which was originally released in 2000. The revised Guides, the revised Dot Com Disclosures and a 2013 FTC workshop on native advertising (i.e., blending advertising content with other content) may be an indication that the FTC may apply increased scrutiny to the use of endorsements, testimonials, and other advertising content online and through traditional media. To the extent we may rely on endorsements or testimonials, we will review any relevant relationships for compliance with the Guides and we will otherwise endeavor to follow legal standards applicable to advertising.  Data Protection Regulations 
  
With the recent increase in publicity regarding data breaches resulting in improper dissemination of consumer information, many states have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach, such as prompt disclosure to affected customers. Generally, these laws are limited to electronic data and make some exemptions for smaller breaches. Congress has also been considering similar federal legislation relating to data breaches. The FTC has also prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act. In addition to data breach notification laws, some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information. These laws may apply directly to our business or indirectly by contract when we provide services to other companies. We intend to continue to comprehensively protect all consumer data and to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of this data.

Research and Development Activities and Costs 
  
We have not incurred any expenses and have spent no time on specialized research and development activities and have no plans to undertake any research or development in the future.   Compliance with Environmental Laws 
  
There are no special environmental laws for offering marketing and advertising services on the internet.   
Employees 
  
Other than our sole officer and director, we have no full-time or part-time employees of our business or operations who are employed at will by the Beliss Corp. Mr. Rajendran currently dedicates as much time as needed to our business affairs. We plan to hire experienced employees in the future when we have sufficient revenues. Our sole directors current training allows him to provide the services we list in this report.  Description of Property 
  
Our offices are currently located at 10a ptc colony, 5 street, Sembakkam, city Chennai, state Tamilnadu, India, ZIP: 600073. Our telephone number is 16208783025. We do not own any real property or significant assets. Once our business grows and generates sufficient revenue, we will look for a more suitable office space in a separate corporate office. Management believes that this office space will meet our needs for the next 18 months.
