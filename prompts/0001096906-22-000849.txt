Item 1. Description of Business
Company Background

Cannabis Sativa, Inc., formerly named Ultra Sun Corporation, was incorporated under laws of Nevada in November 2005. In 2020, we conducted our operations through our subsidiaries PrestoCorp, Inc. (“PrestoCorp”), a 51% owned Delaware corporation engaged in the telemedicine business. We also began the year with interests in GK Manufacturing and Packaging, Inc. (“GKMP”), a California corporation that serves as a contract manufacturer of products containing hemp-based CBD and i-Budtender (IBUD”), a Nevada corporation in the development stage for on-line referral business in the cannabis industry. 

In April, 2021, we discontinued operations of GKMP and IBUD and sold our controlling interests in these subsidiaries. The operations of GKMP and IBUD for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are reported separately as discontinued operations.

We also own 100% of the following subsidiaries: Wild Earth Naturals, Inc. (“Wild Earth”), a Nevada corporation, Eden Holdings LLC (“Eden”), a Virginia limited liability company, Kubby Patent and Licenses, Limited Liability Company (“KPAL”), a Texas limited liability company and Hi Brands International Inc. (“Hi Brands”), a Nevada corporation. Wild Earth, Eden, KPAL, and Hi Brands are currently inactive, but fit into our business strategy as discussed below.

Our common stock is quoted for trading on the OTCQB Market under the symbol CBDS.

We currently maintain virtual principal executive offices with our staff and contractors located remotely and typically working out of their homes. Our mailing address is 450 Hillside Drive, #A224, Mesquite, Nevada 89027. Our telephone number is (702) 763-3123.

Business Strategy

In 2022, we intend to focus on growth of our telemedicine business while seeking opportunities in brand development and marketing of products and services to the cannabidiol (“CBD”) and marijuana industries.
Telemedicine

PrestoCorp (“PrestoDoctor”), offers an online telemedicine platform providing customer access to knowledgeable physicians to obtain a medical marijuana recommendation. PrestoDoctor uses secure video conferencing technology (https://prestodoctor.com) to provide a safe and confidential forum for the Doctor patient interview in accordance with state regulations governing issuance of medical marijuana cards. Appointments through PrestoDoctor's website generally take 10-15 minutes and can be scheduled and completed in the same day. This convenience eliminates the need for patients to travel to a clinic. More than 100,000 users have registered to consult with PrestoDoctor's 15+ licensed physicians across the United States. PrestoDoctor currently offers services in California, Nevada, New York, Missouri, and Oklahoma, and is actively targeting expansion into multiple additional states in the coming months.

Management is currently evaluating opportunities to expand the platform for medical marijuana evaluations into other states and is reviewing other telemedicine applications. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a catalyst for expansion of telemedicine services across the United States, and our existing systems and infrastructure are well suited to providing other similar medical evaluations. The continuing growth of wearable devices and remote monitoring capabilities are further evidence that telemedicine will continue to grow in the coming periods. Growth of the platform to take advantage of these opportunities will require capital for development of new features and capabilities necessary to provide a new service, expansion of personnel and expansion of our contracted physician pool. No assurances can be given that our efforts to expand into new areas and/or provide new services will be successful. 

Brand Development and Product Marketing

We have assembled a portfolio of brands, products, intangible assets, and expertise to allow research, development, acquisition and licensing of specialized cannabis and CBD related products, including cannabis and CBD formulas, edibles, topicals, strains, recipes and delivery systems. We plan to engage in marketing and branding within the cannabis and CBD spaces utilizing our existing brands, including our trademark pending "hi" brand, while also seeking out new opportunities for brand aggregation and marketing. In 2021, we were not able to focus on further development of these assets due to limitations on availability of capital and the need to devote our energies to growth in the telemedicine space. 

In 2022, we hope to begin selling products through our existing online presence. Descriptions of the products/brands we intend to promote include:


5

Wild Earth Naturals, Inc. Wild Earth Naturals, Inc. is an herbal skin care products formulation and marketing company that targets the growing natural health care products market in the United States and abroad. We intend to develop and manufacture high-quality, herbal based skin care products providing healthier choices to consumers. We use specialized ingredient mixing processes to produce plant glycerite/mineral herbal blends and oil extractions, which we believe will be unique to the natural health products industry. The ingredients for our products are selected to meet a number of criteria, including, but not limited to, safety, potency, purity, stability, bio-availability, and efficacy. We plan to control the quality of our products beginning at the formulation stage and continuing through controlled sourcing of raw ingredients, manufacturing, packaging, and labeling.
Hi Brands International Inc. On February 6, 2015, the Company formed Hi Brands International Inc., a Nevada Corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Hi Brands"). Hi Brands entered into a Purchase, Supply and Joint Venture Agreement (the "Agreement"), with Centuria Natural Foods, Inc. ("Centuria") to develop a supply of proprietary CBD (Cannabidiol) Rich Hemp Oil products, but the agreement was never implemented and no business was ever transacted. As a result, Hi Brands International, Inc. has been inactive for the last several years. Although the Hi Brands business has been inactive, the Company believes that there is value in the name and that it may afford a sound outlet for the Company’s products as we build work to build out our product portfolio.

In order to capitalize on the Hi Brands concept, the Company will require capital for a virtual storefront design, online web presence, virtual shopping cart and e-payment capabilities. The concept may also be an attractive base for physical locations, which would then require capital for facilities, physical storefront and interior design, staffing, inventory, and marketing. Until a suitable capital formation plan can be developed and funded, the Hi Brands concept is likely to remain inactive.

Other Opportunities. In addition to licensing, branding and technology, we have the ability to offer mainstream medical prescription discount cards, for which the Company will receive a small percentage on each product purchased. This concept has not yet been implemented but is being evaluated by our Telemedicine division for feasibility and return on investment.

The Company continues to seek the acquisition of companies, intellectual property and other assets that fit within the company's strategic plan of assembling a portfolio of cannabis industry related businesses that have a high growth potential and are accretive to shareholder value.

Perceived Cannabis Industry Trends

We believe the cannabis industry will be characterized by the following principal trends: an increased emphasis on high quality products; an increased emphasis on scientific validation for products in the market place; more liberal regulation in regard to cannabis, even under the current administration as states' rights continue to emerge; more consolidation, take-over, and buy-out of companies in the retail, wholesale, and supply side channels; more mainstream companies entering the marketplace; and more funded research on the potential long-term health benefits of cannabis as well as its potential curative properties.
Vision

Our vision is to become a highly visible, diversified business promoting superior quality branded products and services and offering effective customer service, fair compensation, sound management and a great working environment. Over time, we plan to expand our branding, research and development, intellectual properties and licensing activities to reach markets covering telemedicine and consumer education. In order to achieve this vision, we plan to develop brands and branded products which will distinguish our online presence as a source for innovative and effective medicinal cannabis products and cost-effective alternatives for customers seeking quality, affordable natural health products to aid in wellness and appearance.

Through a long-term commitment to this vision, we hope to become known as a company that is committed to its customers, associates, and communities.

Products

Online Telemedicine. Through PrestoDoctor we provide access to knowledgeable physicians for a safe and confidential way to get a medical marijuana recommendation using secure video conferencing technology. Our online telemedicine generates over 95% of our revenues. 
Consumer Products. Through December 31, 2021, the products discussed below in this section are conceptual and have produced no significant revenues. We had intended to pursue the strategy described below in 2021, but lack of capital largely shifted our strategic implementation plans to 2022. In the remainder of 2022, we expect to work on building a product catalogue as we begin testing the market through online sales of products, including:

· | Lozenges, utilizing our proprietary formula, offer rapid relief of throat irritation. Based upon preliminary results, our lozenges generally take effect within a period of five to 15 minutes. In addition to the lozenges, we have other forms of edibles under consideration.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Recover Deep Penetrating Healing Balm is a fast-acting organic anti-inflammatory pain reliever for sore muscles, joints, arthritic and back pain. 
· | Trauma Cream was developed with a blended infusion of cannabinoids and THC, including Arnica for its numbing effect. 
· | Face Garden is an antioxidant, moisturizing cream for the face. Face Garden is thought to firm the skin and reduce puffiness and wrinkles, while restoring the skins natural glow and supple appearance. 
· | Body Garden is a moisturizing body lotion designed to relieve itchy dry skin and protect against sun damage. 
· | Lip Garden is an emollient balm that we believe can assist with healing of the lips while keeping them supple and moist. 
· | Branded Clothing and Merchandise. We also intend to offer Wild Earth Naturals and "hi" branded men's and women's fashion tee shirts and sweatshirts from suppliers, as well as caps and coffee mugs through the Company's www.wildearthnaturals.com website.

Objectives

Our current strategy is to continue to promote and grow the telemedicine business under our PrestoDoctor brand, while also focusing on the start-up and ramp up of new branding, licensing and product sales opportunities, and we will seek strategic corporate and product acquisitions.
Marketing & Distribution

Market Conditions in the Cannabis Industry. Our target markets are located in states that have legalized the production and use of cannabis. Eighteen states plus the District of Columbia have approved measures to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use. Thirty-seven states, the District of Columbia and five US territories have legalized the use of cannabis for medical use in some form. However, it may take multiple years for a state to establish regulations and for cannabis businesses to begin generating revenue from operations in a given state.

Non-Infused Products and Merchandise. We launched our www.wildearthnaturals.com website in August 2013 but the site has been largely dormant for several years. In 2022, we intend to use social media, primarily Facebook, to drive traffic to our websites. Our online stores at www.wildearthnaturals.com are not producing revenue at this time, but the website is active and ready to process sales orders once the Company rolls out the brand development and product marketing plan for our consumer products lines. 

During 2022, we plan to utilize direct business to business sales, internet advertising, social media marketing, and trade show participation to generate sales leads, orders and to entry into leading retailers and wholesalers throughout the U.S. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in such efforts.

Infused Products. For cannabis infused products, we intend to develop our customer base through licensing agreements with third parties manufacturers who are compliant with state cannabis laws in the states in which they conduct business.

We plan to build brand awareness by utilizing a mix of social media, trade shows, education efforts, and direct marketing to targeted businesses.

Geographic Presence. We plan to build brand awareness for our products in states where medical cannabis is legal, and to sell non-infused products throughout the United States.

Competition

Cannabis Industry. While we do not currently sell products regulated as cannabis (containing THC), we expect to license our brands and products to businesses that will sell cannabis in states where medicinal or recreational cannabis is legal. Therefore, we look to the participants in the medical and recreational cannabis markets for information on competition.

8


We believe the competition in the cannabis market will include numerous cannabis product companies that are fragmented in terms of geographic market coverage, distribution channels and product categories, with many companies taking a state-by-state approach. We believe that competition is principally based upon price, quality, efficacy of products, branding, marketing, customer service, and trade support. We anticipate that large pharmaceutical companies will eventually begin to more aggressively compete in the cannabis product market. These companies and certain larger entities may have broader product lines and/or larger sales volumes than companies such as ours. Larger entities entering this market may have significantly greater financial and other resources available to them and possess extensive manufacturing, distribution and marketing capabilities. We anticipate that many of the larger competitors will be able to compete more effectively due to a greater extent of vertical integration. The entry of larger competitors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Skin Care. Our competition includes numerous skin care companies that are highly fragmented in terms of geographic market coverage, distribution channels, and product categories. In addition, large pharmaceutical companies compete with us in the skin care market. These larger companies have broader product lines and more substantial sales volumes, greater financial and other resources available to them, and possess extensive manufacturing, distribution and marketing capabilities. Among our more prominent competitors are: Earthly Body, Burt's Bees, Melaleuca and Clarins, all of which have substantially longer track records and greater financial resources and operating efficiencies than we will be able to develop in the near term. As a company with limited capital resources, we believe we will be at a competitive disadvantage until such time as we develop a broad portfolio of products that are known and accepted in the industry, and we are able to demonstrate a history of financial stability. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in the market.
Raw Materials and Suppliers

Our products are produced using ingredients that we believe to be readily available from several sources. Our suppliers purchase raw materials from a number of different vendors. While we expect the raw materials we use to be readily available in normal times, the current COVID-19 pandemic and the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine have and are expected to continue to disrupt elements of the supply chain. At this time, we cannot determine the effect such disruptions may have on the availability of raw materials in future periods or the impact of such disruptions on our business development strategies.
Intellectual Property

We hold certain intellectual property (the "IP") consisting of recipes and process/methods to maximize the cannabinoid concentrations used for manufacture of medical marijuana edibles, including our proprietary lozenge. We also hold rights to a proprietary recipe and process/method to maximize the cannabinoid concentrations to be used to make a salve/ointment containing CBD and Arnica Montana.

We are also the patent holder for a CTA strain of cannabis. We are continuing to pursue commercialization of the CTA strain, but no assurances can be given that the patented strain will result in development of any commercial products.

The Company intends to use or license the "hi" brand for skin care products, edibles (infused and non-infused), apparel and branded merchandise. We also hold a Federal trademark on the name and stylized branding of "Wild Earth Naturals". 


9


We have acquired registered U.S. Trademarks for Cannabis*Sativa(R), DISPENSARxY(R), and CannaRx(R). The IP identifiers are Cannabis*Sativa(R), Registration Number 4,868,622, DISPENSARxY(R), Registration Number 4,642,830 and CannaRx(R), Registration Number 4,725,687. The Marks are registered in CL 35 under Goods and Services. No assurance can be given that these marks will have any commercial value, or that they will offer any protection against potential competitors should they be commercialized.

Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business

Currently, our products consist of telemedicine services and we are developing and implementing a business strategy to sell products derived from cannabis plants or products containing THC. Accordingly, while the following discussion on governmental regulation is not directly applicable to the Company today, we may become subject to these regulations in the near future.

The United States federal government regulates drugs in large part through the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. Marijuana, which is a form of cannabis, is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. As a Schedule I controlled substance, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, considers marijuana to have a high potential for abuse with no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States (except as disclosed below for epilepsy and related syndromes) and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. According to the U.S. federal government, cannabis having a concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, greater than 0.3% is marijuana. Cannabis with a THC content below 0.3% is classified as hemp. The scheduling of marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance is inconsistent with what we believe to be widely accepted medical uses for marijuana by physicians, researchers, patients, and others. Moreover, as of November 30, 2020 and despite the clear conflict with U.S. federal law, 35 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical use, while 15 of those states and the District of Columbia have legalized the adult-use of cannabis for recreational purposes. In November 2020, voters in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota voted by referendum to legalize marijuana for adult use, and voters in Mississippi and South Dakota voted to legalized marijuana for medical use. As further evidence of the growing conflict between the U.S. federal treatment of cannabis and the societal acceptance of cannabis, the FDA on June 25, 2018 approved Epidiolex. Epidiolex is an oral solution with an active ingredient derived from the cannabis plant for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, in patients two years of age and older. This is the first FDA-approved drug that contains a purified substance derived from the cannabis plant. In this case, the substance is cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical component of marijuana that does not contain the psychoactive properties of THC.

Marijuana is largely regulated at the state level in the United States. State laws regulating marijuana are in conflict with the CSA, which makes marijuana use and possession federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the United States authorize medical or adult-use marijuana production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under United States federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of marijuana and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal. Although our activities currently do not involve any products that contain THC and we are compliant with the applicable state and local laws in states where we do business, should we enter into a new area that involves THC products, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve us of liability under United States federal law nor provide a defense to any federal criminal action that may be brought against us.

In 2013, as more and more states began to legalize medical and/or adult-use marijuana, the federal government attempted to provide clarity on the incongruity between federal law and these state-legal regulatory frameworks. Until 2018, the federal government provided guidance to federal agencies and banking institutions through a series of DOJ memoranda. The most notable of this guidance came in the form of a memorandum issued by former U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013, which we refer to as the Cole Memorandum.

The Cole Memorandum offered guidance to federal agencies on how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations and prosecutions regarding marijuana in all states and quickly set a standard for marijuana-related businesses to comply with. The Cole Memorandum put forth eight prosecution priorities:


1. | Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors;
---+----------------------------------------------------


2. | Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Preventing the state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana;
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8. | Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property.
---+------------------------------------------------------------


On January 4, 2018, former United States Attorney General Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum by issuing a new memorandum to all United States Attorneys, which we refer to as the Sessions Memo. Rather than establishing national enforcement priorities particular to marijuana-related crimes in jurisdictions where certain marijuana activity was legal under state law, the Sessions Memo simply rescinded the Cole Memorandum and instructed that “[i]n deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute... with the [DOJ’s] finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions.” Namely, these include the seriousness of the offense, history of criminal activity, deterrent effect of prosecution, the interests of victims, and other principles.


11


Under President Biden, Merrick Garland serves as Attorney General in his administration. It is not yet known whether the Department of Justice under President Biden and Attorney General Garland will re-adopt the Cole Memorandum or announce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy.

Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of marijuana will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to marijuana (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. Currently, in the absence of uniform federal guidance, as had been established by the Cole memorandum, enforcement priorities are determined by respective United States Attorneys.

We are not aware of other specific governmental regulations that impact our business. We do, however, utilize Chinese vendors for manufacturing a significant portion of the products we sell. To the extent that tariffs are imposed on imported goods manufactured in China, our pricing structure and acceptance in the marketplace may be affected. We currently stock our products through distributors in foreign countries when appropriate and ship direct from our manufacturer to the foreign distributor when such can be done at a cost savings. We intend to continue to explore ways that we can hold our costs down on the products we sell in order to minimize price sensitivity concerns with our customers.

COVID-19

COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Its rapid spread around the world and throughout the United States prompted many countries, including the United States, to institute restrictions on travel, public gatherings and certain business operations. These restrictions significantly disrupted economic activity in the United States and Worldwide. In retrospect, the pandemic did have a negative impact on the contract manufacturing business start-up (primarily delay) and had a positive impact on our telehealth business through loosening of regulations allowing telehealth services and an increase in persons seeking telehealth services to avoid in person visits to doctors offices. The COVID-19 disruption did not materially impact the Company’s financial statements and may have had a positive on the telehealth market. It now appears that the impacts from COVID are lessening, and we anticipate that any positive impact on the telehealth sector may soften in the coming periods. 

Environmental Laws

We are not aware of any environmental laws that would limit our ability to conduct our current sales and distribution activities in their present form or as we envision them in the near future. As we expand our operations to participate more directly in the cannabis and hemp industries as a distributor of cannabis and hemp products, we may become subject to environmental laws relating to water usage, recycling, waste disposal, and similar regulations that will vary depending on the location of our operations. We intend to address the impact of such environmental regulations when we have a specific use case to evaluate.

Number of Total Employees and Number of Full Time Employees

As of March 31, 2022, we have no employees in Cannabis Sativa, Inc. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had independent contractor arrangements with five officers and directors, and eight outside service providers. PrestoCorp has six employees, including two officers of PrestoCorp. Our employees are not represented by unions, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. The Company also has relationships with several independent contractors who provide services to the Company on a regular and on-going basis.
Facilities

During all of 2021, CBDS operated out of virtual offices maintained by our officers, directors and contractors. 

Our subsidiary PrestoDoctor leases an office in New York on a month-to-month basis for $2,444 per month.

Prior to April 2021, our subsidiary, GKMP, operated out of leased premises in Anaheim, California. We discontinued the operations of GKMP in April 2021, and sold our interest in the subsidiary.
