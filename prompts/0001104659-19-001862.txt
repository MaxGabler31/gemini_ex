Item 1.         BUSINESS
GENERAL
 
MVC Capital, Inc. is an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act).  MVC Capital provides equity and debt investment capital to fund growth, acquisitions and recapitalizations of small and middle-market companies in a variety of industries primarily located in the United States. Our investments can take the form of senior and subordinated loans, common and preferred stock and warrants or rights to acquire equity interests, or convertible securities, among other instruments. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol MVC. Beginning November 1, 2006, the Company has been externally managed by The Tokarz Group Advisers LLC (TTG Advisers) pursuant to an Amended and Restated Investment Advisory and Management Agreement (the Advisory Agreement).  Our Board of Directors, including all of the directors who are not interested persons (as defined under the 1940 Act) of the Company (the Independent Directors), last approved the renewal of the Advisory Agreement at their in-person meeting held on October 30, 2018.
 
In fiscal year 2018, the Company made six new investments, committing capital that totaled approximately $41.5 million.  Pursuant to an exemptive order received by the Company from the SEC (the Order), that allows the Company to co-invest, subject to certain conditions, with certain affiliated private funds as described in the Order, each of the Company and TTGA C-I MMF LP (the Private Fund) co-invested in Essner Manufacturing (Essner) ($3.7 million investment for the Company), Black Diamond Equipment Rental (Black Diamond) ($7.5 million investment for the Company), Apex Industrial Technologies, LLC (Apex) ($15.0 million investment for the Company), Array Information Technology, Inc. (Array) ($6.0 million investment for the Company), Tuf-Tug Inc. (Tuf-Tug) ($5.6 million investment for the Company) and Tin Roof Software, LLC (Tin Roof) ($3.7 million investment for the Company).  During fiscal year 2018, the Company made follow-on investments in the following eight portfolio companies that totaled approximately $20.8 million: U.S. Spray Drying Holding Company (SCSD), Initials, Inc. (Initials), Turf Products, LLC (Turf), Custom Alloy Corporation (Custom Alloy), MVC Automotive Group GmbH (MVC Automotive), RuMe, Inc. (RuMe), Trientis GmbH. (Trientis) and Security Holdings B.V. (Security Holdings).  The total capital committed in

fiscal year 2018 was approximately $62.3 million compared to $7.5 million and $44.2 million in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
During fiscal year 2017, the Company made one new investment in Highpoint Global LLC (Highpoint) ($5.0 million) and made six follow-on investments in the following 4 existing portfolio companies: MVC Automotive, MVC Environmental, Inc. (MVC Environmental), United States Technologies, Inc. (U.S. Technologies) and Security Holdings.  The total capital committed in fiscal year 2017 was approximately $7.5 million compared to $44.2 million and $62.4 million in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
During fiscal year 2016 six new investments were made: Somotra NV (Somotra) ($1.7 million), Pride Engineering, LLC (Pride) ($5.1 million), Dukane IAS, LLC (Dukane) ($7.0 million), Quantum Plastics, LLC (Quantum) ($10.0 million), FDS, Inc. (FDS) ($2.3 million) and HTI Technologies and Industries, Inc. (HTI) ($9.6 million) and 9 follow-on investments in the following 6 existing portfolio companies were made: MVC Automotive, Legal Solutions Holdings, Inc. (Legal Solutions), Thunderdome Restaurants, LLC (Thunderdome), SIA Tekers Invest (Tekers), Biovation Acquisition Company (BAC) and RuMe.  The total capital committed in fiscal year 2016 was $44.2 million compared to $62.4 million and $105.8 million in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
We continue to perform due diligence and seek new investments that are consistent with our objective of maximizing total return from capital appreciation and/or income, though our current focus is more on yield generating investments. We believe that we have extensive relationships with private equity firms, investment banks, business brokers, commercial banks, accounting firms, law firms, hedge funds, other investment firms, industry professionals and management teams of several companies that may provide us with investment opportunities.
 
We are working on an active pipeline of potential new investment opportunities. Our loan and equity investments will generally range between $3.0 million and $25.0 million each, though we may occasionally invest smaller or greater amounts of capital depending upon the particular investment. While the Company does not adhere to a specific equity and debt asset allocation mix, no more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be invested in the securities of one issuer (other than U.S. government securities), or of two or more issuers that are controlled by us and are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses as of the close of each quarter. Our portfolio company investments are typically illiquid and made through privately negotiated transactions. We generally seek to invest in companies with a history of strong, predictable, positive EBITDA (net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization).  The Company has been focusing its strategy more on yield generating investments, which can include, but not limited to senior and subordinated loans, convertible debt, common and preferred equity with a coupon or liquidation preference and warrants or rights to acquire equity interests.
 
Our portfolio company investments currently consist of common and preferred stock, other forms of equity interests and warrants or rights to acquire equity interests, senior and subordinated loans and convertible securities. At October 31, 2018, the fair value of our investments in portfolio companies was approximately $324.5 million and our total assets were approximately $347.1 million compared to the fair value of investments in portfolio companies of approximately $292.5 million and total assets of approximately $403.4 million at October 31, 2017.

We expect that our investments in senior loans and subordinated debt will generally have stated terms of three to ten years. However, there are no constraints on the maturity or duration of any security the Company acquires. Our debt investments are not, and typically will not be, rated by any rating agency, but we believe that if such investments were rated, they would be below investment grade (rated lower than Baa3 by Moodys or lower than BBB- by Standard & Poors). In addition, we may invest without limit in non-rated or debt of any rating, by any rating organization.
 
On July 16, 2004, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, MVC Financial Services, Inc. (MVCFS). MVCFS is incorporated in Delaware and its principal purpose is to provide advisory, administrative and other services to the Company and its portfolio companies.  The Company does not hold MVCFS for investment purposes. The results of MVCFS are consolidated into the Company and all inter-company accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.  On October 14, 2011, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, MVC Cayman, an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, to hold certain of its investments.  The results of MVC Cayman are also consolidated into the Company. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2012 and thereafter, MVC Partners, LLC (MVC Partners) was consolidated with the operations of the Company as MVC Partners limited partnership interest in the PE Fund is a substantial portion of MVC Partners operations.  The consolidation of MVC Partners has not had any material effect on the financial position or net results of operations of the Company.  During fiscal year ended October 31, 2014, MVC Turf, Inc. (MVC Turf) was consolidated with the Company as MVC Turf was an MVC wholly-owned holding company. The consolidation of MVC Turf did not have any material effect on the financial position or net results of operations of the Company.  On March 7, 2017, the Company exchanged its shares of MVC Turf, the holding company that owned the Companys LLC interest in Turf Products, for approximately $3.8 million of additional subordinated debt in Turf Products.  Prior to the exchange, the Company received a distribution from MVC Turf of approximately $323,000. The impact of the deconsolidation of MVC Turf on the Companys financial condition and results of operations was immaterial.  As of October 31, 2017, MVC Turf is no longer consolidated with the Company.  Also, as of October 31, 2018, approximately $1.1 million of the Companys cash and cash equivalents was held by MVC Cayman.
 
Our Board of Directors has the authority to change any of the strategies described in this report without seeking the approval of our shareholders. However, the 1940 Act prohibits us from altering or changing our investment objective, strategies or policies such that we cease to be a business development company, nor can we voluntarily withdraw our election to be regulated as a business development company, without the approval of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, as defined in the 1940 Act, of our shares.
 
Substantially all amounts not invested in securities of portfolio companies are invested in short-term, highly liquid money market investments, U.S. Government issued securities, or held in cash in interest bearing accounts. As of October 31, 2018, the Companys investments in short-term securities, U.S. Government issued securities and cash and cash equivalents were valued at $15.9 million. Of that amount, approximately $5.3 million was restricted cash, $5.0 million related to the compensating balance for Credit Facility III (as defined below) with Santander Bank N.A. and $300,000 cash collateral related to a third-party letter of credit for RuMe.

CORPORATE HISTORY AND OFFICES
 
The Company was organized on December 2, 1999. Prior to July 2004, our name was meVC Draper Fisher Jurvetson Fund I, Inc. On March 31, 2000, the Company raised $330.0 million in an initial public offering whereupon it commenced operations as a closed-end investment company. On December 2, 2002, the Company announced it had begun doing business under the name MVC Capital.
 
We are a Delaware corporation and a non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. On July 16, 2004, the Company formed MVCFS.
 
Although the Company has been in operation since 2000, the year 2003 marked a new beginning for the Company. In February 2003, shareholders elected an entirely new board of directors.  (All but two of the independent members of the current Board of Directors were first elected at the February 2003 Annual Meeting of the shareholders.)  The Board of Directors developed a new long-term strategy for the Company. In September 2003, upon the recommendation of the Board of Directors, shareholders voted to adopt a new investment objective for the Company of seeking to maximize total return from capital appreciation and/or income. The Companys prior objective had been limited to seeking long-term capital appreciation from venture capital investments in the information technology industries. Consistent with our broader objective, we adopted a more flexible investment strategy of providing equity and debt financing to small and middle-market companies in a variety of industries. With the recommendation of the Board of Directors, shareholders also voted to appoint Michael Tokarz as Chairman and Portfolio Manager to lead the implementation of our new objective and strategy and to stabilize the existing portfolio. Prior to the arrival of Mr. Tokarz and his new management team in November 2003, the Company had experienced significant valuation declines from investments made by the former management team.
 
Mr. Tokarz and his team managed the Company under an internal structure through October 31, 2006. On September 7, 2006, the shareholders of the Company approved the Advisory Agreement (with over 92% of the votes cast on the agreement voting in its favor) that provided for the Company to be externally managed by TTG Advisers. The agreement took effect on November 1, 2006. TTG Advisers is a registered investment adviser that is controlled by Mr. Tokarz. All of the individuals (including the Companys investment professionals) that had been previously employed by the Company as of the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006 became employees of TTG Advisers.  The Companys investment approach and selection process has remained the same under the externalized management structure.  Our Board of Directors, including all of the Independent Directors, last approved a renewal of the Advisory Agreement at an in-person meeting held on October 30, 2018.

OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY
 
On November 6, 2003, Mr. Tokarz assumed his current positions as Chairman and Portfolio Manager.  We seek to implement our investment objective to maximize total return from capital appreciation and/or income through making a broad range of private investments in a variety of industries. The investments can include common and preferred stock, other forms of equity interests and warrants or rights to acquire equity interests, senior and subordinated loans, or convertible securities. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, the Company made six new investment and follow-on investments in eight existing portfolio companies, committing a total of $62.3 million of capital to these investments.
 
Prior to the adoption of our current investment objective, the Companys investment objective had been to achieve long-term capital appreciation from venture capital investments in information technology companies. The Companys investments had thus previously focused on investments in equity and debt securities of information technology companies. As of October 31, 2018, 1.4% of our assets consisted of investments made by the Companys former management team pursuant to the prior investment objective (the Legacy Investments). We are, however, managing these Legacy Investments to try and realize maximum returns. At October 31, 2018, the fair value of the Legacy Investments was $5.0 million.  We generally seek to monetize these investments through a sale, public offering, merger or other reorganization.
 
Our new portfolio investments are made pursuant to our current objective and strategy. We are concentrating our investment efforts on small and middle-market companies that, in our view, provide opportunities to maximize total return from capital appreciation and/or income, though our current focus is more on yield generating investments. which can include, but is not be limited to senior and subordinated loans, convertible debt, common and preferred equity with a coupon or liquidation preference and warrants or rights to acquire equity interests (the Yield-Focused Strategy).  Sales of existing investments and repayments would improve our liquidity position, which then provides us with flexibility to redeploy capital into debt or similar income-producing investments.  The Company continues to seek to monetize various equity investments to further support the Yield-Focused Strategy.
 
Under our investment approach, we have the authority to invest, without limit, in any one company, subject to any required diversification limits for us to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company (RIC) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code).  Presently due to our asset composition, compliance with the RIC requirements limits our ability to make additional investments that represent more than 5% of our total assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of an issuer (Non-Diversified Investments).
 
We participate in the private equity business generally by providing negotiated long-term debt and/or equity investment capital. Our financing is generally used to fund growth, buyouts, acquisitions, recapitalizations, note purchases and/or bridge financings. We are typically the lead investor in such transactions, but may also provide debt and equity financing to companies led by private equity firms or others. We generally invest in private companies, though, from time to time, we may invest in small public companies that lack adequate access to public capital.
 
We may also seek to achieve our investment objective by establishing a subsidiary or subsidiaries that would serve as general partner to a private equity or other investment fund(s).

Furthermore, the Board of Directors authorized the establishment of the MVC Private Equity Fund, L.P. (PE Fund), for which an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, MVC GP II, LLC (MVC GP II), of the Company serves as the GP.  On October 29, 2010, through MVC Partners and MVCFS, the Company committed to invest approximately $20.1 million in the PE Fund.  The PE Fund closed on approximately $104 million of capital commitments.  As of October 31, 2018, $14.6 million of the Companys commitment has been contributed.  The Companys Board of Directors authorized the establishment of, and investment in, the PE Fund for a variety of reasons, including the Companys ability to make Non-Diversified Investments through the PE Fund. As previously disclosed, the Company may be restricted in its ability to make Non-Diversified Investments.  For services provided to the PE Fund, the GP and MVC Partners are together entitled to receive 25% of all management fees and other fees paid by the PE Fund and its portfolio companies and up to 30% of the carried interest generated by the PE Fund.  Further, at the direction of the Board of Directors, the GP retained TTG Advisers to serve as the portfolio manager of the PE Fund.  In exchange for providing those services, and pursuant to the Board of Directors authorization and direction, TTG Advisers is entitled to receive the balance of the fees and any carried interest generated by the PE Fund and its portfolio companies.  Given this separate arrangement with the GP and the PE Fund, under the terms of the Companys Advisory Agreement with TTG Advisers, TTG Advisers is not entitled to receive from the Company a management fee or an incentive fee on assets of the Company that are invested in the PE Fund. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2012 and thereafter, MVC Partners was consolidated with the operations of the Company as MVC Partners limited partnership interest in the PE Fund is a substantial portion of MVC Partners operations.  Previously, MVC Partners was presented as a portfolio company on the Schedule of Investments.  The consolidation of MVC Partners has not had any material effect on the financial position or net results of operations of the Company.  Also, during fiscal year ended October 31, 2014, MVC Turf was consolidated with the Company as MVC Turf was an MVC wholly-owned holding company.  The consolidation of MVC Turf did not have a material effect on the financial position or net results of operations of the Company.  On March 7, 2017, the Company exchanged its shares of MVC Turf for approximately $3.8 million of additional subordinated debt in Turf Products.  MVC Turf is no longer consolidated with the Company.  Please see Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements Consolidation for more information.
 
As a result of the closing of the PE Fund, consistent with the Board-approved policy concerning the allocation of investment opportunities, the PE Fund received a priority allocation of all private equity investments that would otherwise be Non-Diversified Investments for the Company during the PE Funds investment period that ended on October 28, 2014.  Additional capital may be called for follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies of the PE Fund or to pay operating expenses of the PE Fund while the partnership is in existence.
 
Additionally, in pursuit of our objective, we may acquire a portfolio of existing private equity or debt investments held by financial institutions or other investment funds should such opportunities arise.
 
Furthermore, pending investments in portfolio companies pursuant to the Companys principal investment strategy, the Company may invest in certain securities on a short-term or temporary basis.  In addition to cash-equivalents and other money market-type investments, such short-term investments may include exchange-traded funds and private investment funds offering periodic liquidity.

Substantially all amounts not invested in securities of portfolio companies are invested in short-term, highly liquid money market investments, U.S. Government issued securities, or held in cash in an interest bearing account. As of October 31, 2018, these holdings were valued at approximately $15.9 million or 7.0% of net assets.
 
The current portfolio has investments in a variety of industries, including energy, specialty chemicals, automotive dealerships, electrical engineering, medical devices, consumer products, value-added distribution, industrial manufacturing, financial services, and information technology in a variety of geographical areas, including the United States and Europe.
 
On October 10, 2017, the Board detailed its unanimously approved plan seeking to increase shareholder value through, among other things, continued implementation of the Yield-Focused Strategy and increasing the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share from $0.135 per share.
 
Market. We have developed and maintain relationships with intermediaries, including investment banks, industry executives, financial services companies and private mezzanine and equity sponsors to source investment opportunities. Through these relationships, we have been able to strengthen our position as an investor.
Investment Criteria. Prospective investments are evaluated by the investment team based upon criteria that may be modified from time to time. The criteria currently being used by management in determining whether to make an investment in a prospective portfolio company include, but are not limited to, managements view of:
 
·                  Opportunity to revitalize and redirect a companys resources and strategy;
 
·                  Stable free cash flow of the business;
 
·                  Businesses with secure market niches and predictable profit margins;
 
·                  The presence or availability of highly qualified management teams;
 
·                  The line of products or services offered and their market potential;
 
9




·                  The presence of a sustainable competitive advantage;
 
·                  Favorable industry and competitive dynamics; and
 
·                  Yield potential offered by an investment in such company.
 
Due diligence includes a thorough review and analysis of the business plan and operations of a company in which we are considering making an investment. We generally perform financial and operational due diligence, study the industry and competitive landscape, and meet with current and former employees, customers, suppliers and/or competitors. In addition, as applicable, we engage attorneys, independent accountants and other consultants to assist with legal, environmental, tax, accounting and marketing due diligence.
 
Investment Sourcing. Mr. Tokarz and the other investment professionals have established an extensive network of investment referral relationships. Our network of relationships with investors, lenders and intermediaries includes:
 
·                                          Private mezzanine and equity investors;
 
·                                          Investment banks;
 
·                                          Industry executives;
 
·                                          Business brokers;
 
·                                          Merger and acquisition advisors;
 
·                                          Financial services companies; and
 
·                                          Banks, law firms and accountants.
 
Allocation of Investment Opportunities.  In allocating investment opportunities, TTG Advisers adheres to the following policy, which was approved by the Board of Directors: TTG Advisers will generally give the Company priority with respect to all investment opportunities in (i) mezzanine and debt securities and (ii) equity or other non-debt investments that are (a) expected to be equal to or less than the lesser of 10% of the Companys net assets or $25.0 million, and (b) issued by U.S. companies with less than $150.0 million in revenues during the prior twelve months (MVC Targeted Investments); provided that such priority may be shared with any other investment vehicle managed by TTG Advisers so long as: (i) such vehicle is subject to the Order (defined below) granted to MVC (an Other Vehicle), and (ii) to the extent TTG Advisers determines the opportunity to be suitable and appropriate for each of MVC and the vehicle to participate in such investment at that time, then MVC shall co-invest with the Other Vehicle in such opportunity in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of the Order.  The PE Fund received a priority allocation of all the new equity investments (i.e., not follow-on investments in existing MVC portfolio companies) that would otherwise be Non-Diversified Investments for the Company, which terminated on the deployment of 80% of the committed capital of the PE Fund.  The investment period related to the PE Fund has ended.  Additional capital may be called for follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies of the PE Fund or to pay operating expenses of the PE Fund.  In addition, pursuant to a shared services arrangement with PPC Enterprises LLC (PPC), a registered investment adviser (of which Mr. Tokarz is a co-founder and investment team
 
10




member) that provides advisory services to Series A of Public Pension Capital, LLC (the PPC Fund), a private equity fund, Firm personnel may refer to PPC and the PPC Fund any investment that is not: (i) an MVC Targeted Investment; and (ii) in a company that, at the time of acquisition, has EBITDA in excess of $25 million or is expected to require, either at such time or over time, in excess of $25 million in aggregate equity capital (i.e., an investment that is outside of the PE Funds investment focus pursuant to its governing documents).
 
Investment Structure. Portfolio company investments typically will be negotiated directly with the prospective portfolio company or its affiliates. The investment professionals will structure the terms of a proposed investment, including the purchase price, the type of security to be purchased or financing to be provided and the future involvement of the Company and affiliates in the portfolio companys business (including potential representation on its Board of Directors). The investment professionals will seek to structure the terms of the investment as to provide for the capital needs of the portfolio company and at the same time seek to maximize the Companys total return.
 
Once we have determined that a prospective portfolio company is a suitable investment, we work with the management and, in certain cases, other capital providers, such as senior, junior and/or equity capital providers, to structure an investment.  We negotiate on how our investment is expected to relate relative to the other capital in the portfolio companys capital structure.
 
We make preferred and common equity investments in companies as a part of our investing activities, particularly when we see a unique opportunity to profit from the growth of a company and the potential to enhance our returns. At times, we may invest in companies that are undergoing new strategic initiatives or a restructuring but have several of the above attributes and a management team that we believe has the potential to successfully execute their plans. Preferred equity investments may be structured with a dividend yield, which may provide us with a current return, if earned and received by the Company.
 
Our senior, subordinated and mezzanine debt investments are tailored to the facts and circumstances of the deal. The specific structure is negotiated over a period of several weeks and is designed to seek to protect our rights and manage our risk in the transaction. We may structure the debt instrument to require restrictive affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, equity calls, take control provisions and board observation. Our debt investments are not, and typically will not be, rated by any rating agency, but we believe that if such investments were rated, they would be below investment grade quality (rated lower than Baa3 by Moodys or lower than BBB by Standard & Poors, commonly referred to as junk bonds).
 
Our mezzanine debt investments are typically structured as subordinated loans (with or without warrants) that carry a fixed rate of interest.  The loans may have interest-only payments in the early years and payments of both principal and interest in the later years, with maturities of three to ten years, although debt maturities and principal amortization schedules vary.
 
Our mezzanine debt investments may include equity features, such as warrants or options to buy a minority interest in a portfolio company. Any warrants or other rights we receive with our debt securities generally require only a nominal cost to exercise, and thus, as the portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. We may structure the warrants to provide minority rights provisions and event-driven puts. We may seek to achieve additional investment return from the appreciation and sale of our warrants.

Under certain circumstances, the Company or PE Fund may acquire more than 50% of the common stock of a company in a control buyout transaction. In addition to our common equity investment, we may also provide additional capital to the controlled portfolio company in the form of senior loans, subordinated debt or preferred stock.
 
We fund new investments using cash, proceeds from sales of investments, the reinvestment of accrued interest and dividends in debt and equity securities, or the current reinvestment of interest and dividend income through the receipt of a debt or equity security (payment-in-kind income).  From time to time, we may also opt to reinvest accrued interest receivable in a new debt or equity security, in lieu of receiving such interest in cash and funding a subsequent investment. We may also acquire investments through the issuance of common or preferred stock, debt, or warrants representing rights to purchase shares of our common or preferred stock.  The issuance of our stock as consideration may provide us with the benefit of raising equity without having to access the public capital markets in an underwritten offering, including the added benefit of the elimination of any commissions payable to underwriters.
 
Providing Management Assistance. As a business development company, we are required to make managerial assistance available to the companies in our investment portfolio. In addition to the interest and dividends received from our investments, we often generate additional fee income for the structuring, diligence, transaction, administration and management services and financial guarantees we provide to our portfolio companies through the Company or our wholly-owned subsidiary, MVCFS.  In some cases, officers, directors and employees of the Company or the Adviser may serve as members of the Board of Directors or Board of Directors observers of portfolio companies.  The Company may provide guidance and management assistance to portfolio companies with respect to such matters as budgets, profit goals, business and financing strategies, management additions or replacements and plans for liquidity events for portfolio company investors such as a merger or initial public offering.
Portfolio Company Monitoring. We monitor our portfolio companies closely to determine whether or not they continue to be attractive candidates for further investment. Specifically, we monitor their ongoing performance and operations and provide guidance and assistance where appropriate. We would decline additional investments in portfolio companies that, in TTG Advisers view, do not continue to show promise. However, we may make follow-on investments in portfolio companies that we believe may perform well in the future.
 
TTG Advisers follows established procedures for monitoring equity and loan investments. The investment professionals have developed a multi-dimensional flexible rating system for all of the Companys portfolio investments. The rating grids are updated regularly and reviewed by the Portfolio Manager, together with the investment team. Additionally, the Companys Valuation Committee (the Valuation Committee) meets at least quarterly, to review a written valuation memorandum and materials for each portfolio company and to discuss business updates. Furthermore, the Companys Chief Compliance Officer administers the Companys compliance policies and procedures, which includes the Companys investments in portfolio companies.
 
We exit our investments generally when a liquidity event takes place, such as the sale, recapitalization or initial public offering of a portfolio company. Our equity holdings, including shares underlying warrants, after the exercise of such warrants, typically include registration rights, which would allow us to sell the securities if the portfolio company completes a public offering.

Investment Approval Procedures. Generally, prior to approving any new investment, we follow the process outlined below. We usually conduct one to four months of due diligence and structuring before an investment is considered for approval. However, depending on the type of investment being contemplated, this process may be longer or shorter.
 
The typical key steps in our investment approval process are:
 
·                  Initial investment screening by deal person or investment team;
 
·                  Investment professionals present an investment proposal containing key terms and understandings (verbal and written) to the entire investment team;
 
·                  Our Chief Compliance Officer reviews the proposed investment for compliance with the 1940 Act, the Code and all other relevant rules and regulations;
 
·                  Investment professionals are authorized to commence due diligence;
 
·                  Any investment professional can call a meeting, as deemed necessary, to: (i) review the due diligence reports; (ii) review the investment structure and terms; (iii) or to obtain any other information deemed relevant;
 
·                  Once all due diligence is completed, the proposed investment is rated using a rating system, which tests several factors including, but not limited to, cash flow, EBITDA growth, management and business stability. We use this rating system as the base line for tracking the investment in the future;
 
·                  Our Chief Compliance Officer confirms that the proposed investment will not cause us to violate the 1940 Act, the Code or any other applicable rule or regulation;
 
·                  Mr. Tokarz approves the transaction; and
 
·                  The investment is funded.
 
Hedging Transactions.  The Company, in the Advisers complete discretion, may also (but is not obligated to) enter into derivative or other transactions (such as forward, futures or options transactions) seeking to hedge the Companys or a portfolio companys exposure to currency, commodity or other risks.
Employees. Since the effectiveness of the Advisory Agreement on November 1, 2006, the Company has not had any direct employees.  TTG Advisers employs 20 individuals, including investment and portfolio management professionals, operations professionals and administrative staff.
OPERATING EXPENSES
 
During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, the Company bore the costs relating to the Companys operations, including fees and expenses of the Independent Directors; fees of unaffiliated transfer agents, registrars and disbursing agents; legal and accounting expenses; costs of printing and mailing proxy materials and reports to shareholders; NYSE fees; management fee; incentive fee, if applicable; travel and due diligence costs related to investments; custodian fees and

other extraordinary or nonrecurring expenses and other expenses properly payable by the Company.  It should be noted that the Company and TTG Advisers had entered into an agreement pursuant to which TTG Advisers would absorb or reimburse operating expenses of the Company to the extent necessary to limit the Companys expense ratio to 3.5% in each of the 2009 and 2010 fiscal years (the consolidated expenses of the Company, including any amounts payable to TTG Advisers under the base management fee, but excluding the amount of any interest and other direct borrowing costs, taxes, incentive compensation, payments made by the GP of the PE Fund to TTG Advisers pursuant to the Portfolio Management Agreement between the GP and TTG Advisers respecting the PE Fund and extraordinary expenses taken as a percentage of the Companys average net assets).  On various dates, TTG Advisers and the Company entered into annual agreements to extend the expense cap of 3.5% to the 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 fiscal years (Expense Limitation Agreement).  On October 29, 2015, the Company and the Adviser agreed, with respect to fiscal year 2016, to lower the expense cap percentage to 3.25% and modify the methodology so that the cap limits the Companys ratio of expenses to total assets less cash (the Modified Methodology), consistent with the asset level used to calculate the base management fee. (The expenses covered by the cap remain unchanged.)  The amount of any payments made by the GP of the PE Fund to TTG Advisers pursuant to the Portfolio Management Agreement between the GP and TTG Advisers respecting the PE Fund continues to be excluded from the calculation of the Companys expense ratio under the Expense Limitation Agreement.  In addition, for fiscal years 2010 through 2019, TTG Advisers voluntarily agreed to waive $150,000 of expenses that the Company is obligated to reimburse to TTG Advisers under the Advisory Agreement (the Voluntary Waiver).  TTG Advisers also voluntarily agreed that any assets of the Company that are invested in exchange-traded funds would not be taken into account in the calculation of the base management fee due to TTG Advisers under the Advisory Agreement.  As of October 31, 2018, the Company did not have an investment in an exchange-traded fund.  On October 28, 2016, the Board approved the renewal of the Advisory Agreement for the 2017 fiscal year. The Adviser agreed to continue to waive a portion of the base management fee so that it was reduced to 1.50% for fiscal year 2017.  Furthermore, the Company and the Adviser, similar to fiscal year 2016, agreed on an expense cap for fiscal years 2017 through 2019 of 3.25% under the Modified Methodology.  In addition, the Adviser has agreed, effective November 1, 2017, to a revised management fee structure that ties management fees to the NAV discount1 as follows: (A) If the Companys NAV discount is greater than 20%, the management fee for the current quarter is reduced to 1.25%; (B) If the NAV discount is between 10% and 20%, the management fee will be 1.50%; and (C) If the NAV discount is less than 10% or eliminated, the 1.50% management fee would be re-examined, but in no event would it exceed 1.75%.
 
Under the externalized structure, all investment professionals of TTG Advisers and its staff, when and to the extent engaged in providing services required to be provided by TTG Advisers under the Advisory Agreement and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by TTG Advisers and not by the Company, except that costs or expenses relating to the following items are borne by the Company:  (i) the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm; (ii) expenses incurred by TTG Advisers payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for the Company and in monitoring the Companys investments and performing due diligence on its prospective portfolio companies, provided, however, the retention

by TTG Advisers of any third party to perform such services shall require the advance approval of the board (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) if the fees for such services are expected to exceed $30,000; once the third party is approved, any expenditure to such third party will not require additional approval from the board; (iii) interest payable on debt and other direct borrowing costs, if any, incurred to finance the Companys investments or to maintain its tax status; (iv) offerings of the Companys common stock and other securities; (v) investment advisory and management fees; (vi) fees and payments due under any administration agreement between the Company and its administrator; (vii) transfer agent and custodial fees; (viii) federal and state registration fees; (ix) all costs of registration and listing the Companys shares on any securities exchange; (x) federal, state and local taxes; (xi) independent directors fees and expenses; (xii) costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by governmental bodies (including the SEC); (xiii) costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing and mailing costs; (xiv) the cost of the Companys fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; (xv) direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, independent auditors and outside legal costs; (xvi) the costs and expenses associated with the establishment of a special purpose vehicle; (xvii) the allocable portion of the cost (excluding office space) of the Companys Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary in an amount not to exceed $200,000, per year, in the aggregate;  (xviii) subject to a cap of $150,000 in any fiscal year of the Company, fifty percent of the unreimbursed travel and other related (e.g., meals) out-of-pocket expenses (subject to item (ii) above) incurred by TTG Advisers in sourcing investments for the Company; provided that, if the investment is sourced for multiple clients of TTG Advisers, then the Company shall only reimburse fifty percent of its allocable pro rata portion of such expenses; and (xix) all other expenses incurred by the Company in connection with administering the Companys business (including travel and other out-of-pocket expenses (subject to item (ii) above) incurred in providing significant managerial assistance to a portfolio company).
 
VALUATION OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the 1940 Act and in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), we value our portfolio securities at their current market values or, if market quotations are not readily available, at their estimated fair values. Because our portfolio company investments generally do not have readily ascertainable market values, we record these investments at fair value in accordance with our Valuation Procedures adopted by the Board of Directors, which are consistent with ASC 820.  As permitted by the SEC, the Board of Directors has delegated the responsibility of making fair value determinations to the Valuation Committee, subject to the Board of Directors supervision and pursuant to our Valuation Procedures.  Our Board of Directors may also hire independent consultants to review our Valuation Procedures or to conduct an independent valuation of one or more of our portfolio investments.
 
Pursuant to our Valuation Procedures, the Valuation Committee (which is comprised of three Independent Directors) determines fair values of portfolio company investments on a quarterly basis (or more frequently, if deemed appropriate under the circumstances). In doing so, the Committee considers the recommendations of TTG Advisers.  The Committee also takes into account input and reviews by third party consultants retained to support the Companys valuation process. The Company has also adopted other enhanced processes related to valuations of controlled/affiliated portfolio companies. Any changes in valuation are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments.

Currently, our NAV per share is calculated and published on a quarterly basis.  The Company calculates our NAV per share by subtracting all liabilities from the total value of our portfolio securities and other assets and dividing the result by the total number of outstanding shares of our common stock on the date of valuation.  Fair values of foreign investments reflect exchange rates, as applicable, in effect on the last business day of the quarter end.  Exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis, sometimes significantly.  Exchange rate fluctuations following the most recent fiscal year end are not reflected in the valuations reported in this Annual Report.  See
