 Item 1. Business. 
Introduction
 Arcturus Therapeutics Ltd. (“we,” “us,” “Arcturus,” or the “Company”) is an RNA medicines company focused on significant opportunities in rare diseases with a current focus on liver and respiratory diseases.  In addition to our internal mRNA platform, our proprietary lipid nanopartical deliver system, LUNAR®, enables multiple nucleic acid medicines.  The Company’s internet address is https://arcturusrx.com/. The Company was founded in 2013.  On November 15, 2017, Alcobra Ltd. acquired Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc. (“Arcturus Inc.”) pursuant to a merger between the companies. Immediately after giving effect to the merger, on November 15, 2017, Alcobra Ltd. changed its name to Arcturus Therapeutics Ltd. On November 16, 2017, the Company commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “ARCT.” On February 11, 2019, we disclosed our intention to initiate a process to redomicile from an Israeli limited company to a U.S. corporation, as described more fully under “Redomiciliation,” below.  
 The Company’s principal executive offices are located in San Diego, California. Our key proprietary technology has the potential to address the major hurdles in RNA development, namely the effective and safe delivery of RNA therapeutics to disease-relevant target tissues. We believe the versatility of our platform to target multiple tissues, its compatibility with various nucleic acid therapeutics, and our expertise in developing scalable manufacturing processes puts us in a good position to deliver on the next generation of nucleic medicines.

 Recent Developments
 Redomiciliation
 On February 11, 2019, we disclosed our intention to initiate a process to redomicile from an Israeli limited company to a U.S. corporation. The final form and timing of the redomiciliation has not yet been finalized and the redomiciliation is subject to the approval of our shareholders, Israeli court approval and approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), among other conditions precedent. On February 11, 2019, we filed an application with the Tel Aviv District Court to approve the convening of a general shareholders meeting of the Company for the approval of the redomiciliation pursuant to Sections 350 and 351 of the Israeli Companies Law (the “Companies Law”).
 In connection with the redomiciliation, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement between the Company and a special-purpose company, Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc. (“NewCo”) (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) in connection with the contemplated redomiciling of the Company from Israel to Delaware (the “Redomiciliation”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, and in order to effectuate the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement, on February 11, 2019, the Company filed an application with the 
 3

Tel Aviv District Court to approve the convening of a general shareholders meeting of the Company for the approval of the Redomiciliation pursuant to Sections 350 and 351 of the Companies Law, 1999-5759. The Share Exchange Agreement and the Redomiciliation are subject to shareholder approval as required by the Companies Law, Israeli court approval, effectiveness of filings to be made with the SEC, approval of the listing of shares of NewCo by the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) and the other conditions precedent set forth in the Share Exchange Agreement (the “Conditions Precedent”).
 In furtherance of the Redomiciliation, the holders of Ordinary Shares of the Company as of a future record date and the holders of options to purchase Ordinary Shares of the Company as of the same record date will transfer their Ordinary Shares of the Company and options to purchase Ordinary Shares of the Company, respectively, to NewCo and, in exchange thereof, will receive one share of common stock of NewCo for each ordinary share of the Company and one option to purchase one share of common stock of NewCo in exchange for each option to purchase an ordinary share of the Company, respectively.
 The Company intends the common stock of NewCo to be listed on NASDAQ. Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement, it is expected that the Company’s Ordinary Shares will be delisted from trading on NASDAQ, and the Company is expected to become a private company (as defined in the Companies Law) wholly-owned by NewCo.
 Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company also agreed, subject to the Conditions Precedent set forth therein, to transfer all of the shares of Arcturus Therapeutics Inc. (“Arcturus Sub”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to NewCo through a reduction of the Company’s equity and the distribution of a dividend-in-kind, such that Arcturus Sub and the Company shall each become a wholly-owned and direct subsidiary of NewCo.
 Ornithine Transcarbamylase (OTC) Deficiency Development Program
 On February 11, 2019, the Company announced the termination of the obligations of CureVac AG for the preclinical development of ARCT-810, effective 180 days from February 5, 2019 and the re-assumption by the Company of the worldwide rights thereto.  Arcturus will reassume 100% global rights for its flagship asset, clinical development candidate ARCT-810, a messenger RNA (mRNA) drug to treat OTC deficiency. ARCT-810 was previously subject to a 50/50 collaboration between Arcturus and CureVac AG. CureVac elected not to continue its obligations for the development of ARCT-810 under and pursuant to the terms of the collaboration.
 The preclinical development program for ARCT-810, including Investigational New Drug Application (IND) enabling studies, remains on track. Arcturus is planning to file an IND for ARCT-810 with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the fourth quarter of 2019.
 Pursuant to the terms of the Co-Development Agreement, CureVac is obligated to continue to fund its share of the preclinical expenses for the OTC program until August 5, 2019. 
 Current Technologies and Limitations 
 Messenger RNA can be immunogenic. The current lipid nanoparticle technology used to deliver mRNA therapeutics are also limited by their propensity to cause immune responses. This decreases the tolerability of the medicine. These delivery systems are not biodegradable, which causes accumulation of these lipids in cells upon repeat dosing.  Each of these aspects of current lipid nanoparticle delivery systems is expected to ultimately limit the utility and therapeutic reach of the RNA therapies they deliver. 
 Arcturus aims to mitigate the immune response and tolerability issues associated with the LNP mRNA delivery with the development of both less immunogenic mRNAs and biodegradable lipids. The Company has developed processes for the scale up of LNP-mRNA therapeutics to support clinical development.

mRNA therapeutics offer an attractive promise that other RNA medicines cannot provide – to increase the production of a protein in the body that is either defective or expressed at low levels to improve symptoms of a genetic disease without interacting with the patient’s genetic code.  mRNA therapies have yet to be successful in delivering an approved therapy to patients because of the technical hurdles facing this therapeutic approach.  These hurdles include:
  
• | delivery of an intact mRNA, which is much larger than other RNA drugs, to the target organ and cell type needed for a therapeutic effect;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | inefficient translation into the therapeutic protein;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | short duration of effect of the mRNA medicine and
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | tolerability issues associated with therapeutic RNAs.
--+------------------------------------------------------

 Arcturus’ lipid-mediated delivery platform is designed to address many of the technical issues encountered to date for this very promising area of RNA medicines.
 RNA Medicines, Markets and Arcturus’ Technology
 There is a significant, unmet medical need in the field of rare genetic diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 10,000 diseases are caused by an error, or mutation, in a single gene, and currently no FDA-approved drug exists for over 95% of known, rare genetic diseases. Moreover, these diseases affect one in a hundred people at birth, and 350 million people worldwide live with a rare genetic disease. Many of these diseases cause moderate to severe symptoms, significantly decreasing quality of life and life expectancy.
 
Nucleic acid medicines have the potential to treat diseases caused by genetic mutations, including diseases that cannot be treated by conventional drugs, such as small molecules and biologics. Some of these medicines function by providing the means for producing a deficient yet vital protein in vivo.  Within a cell, DNA carries the blueprint, in the form of genes, from which all proteins necessary for life are encoded. Each gene has the code, carried by a nucleic acid molecule called messenger RNA (“mRNA”), informing the cell’s machinery the pattern of building blocks for making one or more proteins needed for normal biological function. 
 
Nucleic acid therapeutics represent a significant advancement in targeted medicines and several of this class of therapeutics are being developed by public and private companies. These therapies have three general objectives:
  
• | to reduce the amount of a target protein in a patient by binding to and destroying the associated target mRNA (antisense and small interfering RNA (“siRNA”));
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to increase the amount of a functioning target protein by introducing a functional gene or mRNA that encodes for a protein that replaces a malfunctioning protein (mRNA therapy, CRISPR, gene therapy, replicon); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to introduce proteins from viruses or malfunctioning proteins in certain cancers to train the immune system to recognize and clear these proteins (nucleic acid vaccines).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 siRNA therapies, double-stranded RNA compounds that activate machinery in the cell to destroy a target RNA in the body, are useful in treating diseases caused by viral infections, malfunctioning proteins or an excess of certain proteins that contribute to the severity of symptoms of a disease. siRNA compounds are designed to bind perfectly to one mRNA and trigger machinery in the body to cause the cell to destroy the disease-causing mRNA. This mechanism, called RNA interference (“RNAi”), can be used to prevent mutated genes from being translated into defective proteins that cause disease and can stop viruses from replicating inside the body.
 Naked RNA and some DNA molecules are quickly degraded by enzymes in the bloodstream and can cause a strong immune response. Therefore, nucleic acid medicines (mRNA, DNA and siRNA) developed for systemic use must use a vector to deliver the nucleic acid medicine to target cells. Viral delivery vectors and lipid-mediated delivery systems are the two main delivery systems used in a large number of nucleic acid-based therapeutics in development.
 5

Viral delivery vectors are very effective at delivering DNA to alter the genetic make-up of the patient’s cells. However, they can cause liver damage and activate an immune response in human patients. Viral vectors may also cause accidental mutations in host DNA. Patients treated with viral vectors can also develop antibodies against these vectors that make the treatment less effective over time.  
 Lipid-mediated delivery systems are the most common non-viral vectors because they are biocompatible and do not cause insertional mutagenesis. They can also be manipulated to target specific cells in the body. In 2018, the first siRNA therapy using a lipid-mediated delivery system was approved by the FDA for the treatment of polyneuropathy associated with hereditary transthyretin (hTTR) amyloidosis, Onpattro® (Patisiran). Despite these advantages, older lipid-mediated delivery systems, like that utilized in Onpattro®, can stimulate adverse immune responses, requiring co-administration of steroids, and cause liver damage in patients due to their inability to be degraded by the body.
 Our Platform Technology
 LUNAR
 Our LUNAR® lipid-mediated delivery technology includes a diverse, growing library of over 150 proprietary lipids that we rationally designed to be versatile, maximizing efficacy and increasing tolerability of a diverse selection of nucleic acids, target cell types and routes of administration. A key feature of our LUNAR lipids is their biodegradability, decreasing the undesired effects caused by lipid accumulation that are associated with tolerability issues present in other lipid-mediated RNA medicine delivery platforms. Our experienced team continues to innovate in the area of producing LUNAR lipid formulated nucleic acid medicines in a scalable and highly-reproducible manner, reducing the costs of goods for the therapies in our pipeline.
 In addition to our LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery technology, we believe we have created innovative, proprietary improvements to producing mRNA medicines, including improvements that increase purity, scalability, efficiency in production times, and adaptability to different mRNA modification strategies.  We strive to use these proprietary innovations to benefit each mRNA medicine in our pipeline.
 We continue to invest in our LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery of mRNA (encoding CRISPR, TALEN, zinc finger proteins, and meganucleases), siRNA, DNA, microRNA, and antisense oligonucleotide technology platforms to improve their efficacy and safety profile, further expanding their applications. This investment had led to key innovations ensuring optimal characteristics of our LUNAR formulated drug product are attained, which we believe sets us apart from other nucleic acid therapeutics and lipid-mediated delivery platforms.

Our Pipeline 

We are using our proprietary technology to develop nucleic acid medicines to treat diseases with unmet medical needs, accelerated clinical paths and clear commercial opportunities. Our preclinical pipeline currently has seven active preclinical drug discovery and development programs. This includes wholly-owned programs as well as programs in partnership with Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical, Inc. (“Ultragenyx”), Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”), Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson (“Janssen”), Synthetic Genomics, Inc. (“Synthetic Genomics” or “SGI”) and CureVac AG (“CureVac”). 

• | The LUNAR-OTC program is developing mRNA compounds to treat ornithine transcarbamylase (“OTC”) deficiency, a life-threatening genetic disease that affects greater than 10,000 people. We have achieved preclinical proof-of-concept for LUNAR-OTC in a mouse model of the disease. This program was previously co-developed with CureVac, but will become a wholly-owned internal program in August of 2019.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The LUNAR-CF program is developing mRNA compounds to replace dysfunctional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (“CFTR”) protein in cystic fibrosis (“CF”) patients. CF is a common genetic disease in the United States, and approximately 1,000 patients are newly diagnosed each year. This program is supported by Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc., or CFFT. We have demonstrated activity of an optimized CFTR mRNA in cultured cells and proof of concept for LUNAR delivery to lung epithelial cells in vivo.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | LUNAR-RLD is an internal research effort focused on target validation of multiple pipeline LUNAR-mRNA program candidates. A rare liver disease will be selected as a future development program based on these efforts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | We are partnering with Janssen, a Johnson & Johnson company, to develop nucleic acid-based products for the treatment of hepatitis B virus infection (“HBV”) and potentially other infectious and respiratory diseases.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are partnering with Takeda to develop nucleic acid-based therapeutic candidates primarily for the treatment of liver fibrosis. The agreement was entered into on March 8, 2019.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are partnering with Ultragenyx to develop up to ten mRNA therapeutic candidates for certain rare disease targets. LUNAR-GSD3 is the first program to be disclosed from the collaboration. Glycogen Storage Disease Type 3 (“GSD”) is caused by genetic mutations in the glycogen debranching enzyme, AGL, which leads to glycogen accumulation in liver and muscle. There are approximately 10,000 patients worldwide with this type of GSD, who experience enlarged liver, increased fats in the blood, low blood sugar, decreased stature and late-onset muscle weakness. There is not currently a cure for GSD3. Treatment typically includes a high-protein diet with cornstarch supplementation to maintain a normal level of glucose in the blood. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have a license and collaboration agreement with SGI focused on developing vaccines and therapeutics using their proprietary self-replicating (replicon) nucleic acid technology. We have demonstrated proof-of-concept in preclinical animal models for both vaccines and therapeutics.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are partnering with Providence Therapeutics Inc. (“Providence”) to identify and optimize microRNA modulators and/or mimetics for the treatment of neoplastic diseases.

Our Strategy
 We aim to leverage our proprietary and licensed intellectual property relating to LUNAR and our nucleic acid technologies to develop a pipeline of mRNA therapeutics for infectious rare diseases and rare genetic disorders with significant unmet medical needs. In addition to our collaborations noted above, we are focused on balancing our portfolio with internally-owned and partnered programs to advance our preclinical candidates in a timely and cost-effective manner. 
 Our flagship program, LUNAR-OTC, is on track to enter first-in-human studies during 2020.
 Our business strategy has three main areas of focus:
  
• | Drive existing collaborations to achieve first-in-human data for our LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery platform. The value and promise of our proprietary LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery platform has been recognized by our current partners and continuing partner interest. This value is expected to increase substantially when our pre-clinical data from our LUNAR formulated mRNA medicines is reproduced in our first human clinical studies. We continue to push our first mRNA therapeutic, LUNAR-OTC, toward the clinic and our LUNAR-CF program is supported by our important collaboration with the CF Foundation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery platform to develop therapeutics for a broad range of additional rare liver and lung diseases. We have demonstrated in preclinical models the utility of the LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery platform in two important liver cell types, stellate and hepatocyte, as well as bronchial cells in lungs. Our research teams are currently focused internally on discovering our next wave of innovative mRNA medicines, and externally for other nucleic acid modalities, for patients with debilitating rare diseases.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to innovate in our core areas of research, including mRNA design and siRNA design, LUNAR lipid formulations and formulation production to increase our competitive advantage over other nucleic acid medicine companies. Our team has a wealth of research and development experience in the areas of siRNA and mRNA medicine design. We continue to identify new and better ways to design and produce these important nucleic acid medicines, increasing their efficacy and safety profiles. In addition, our team has an advanced understandings of lipid-nanoparticle formulations, continually improving scalability and reproducibility of our LUNAR formulated nucleic acid drug products, translating to better therapies for patients.

Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe our proprietary LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery and nucleic acid technologies, extensive intellectual property portfolio and experienced research and development team will enable us to advance our drug candidates and existing partnerships, and further partner our technology platform thereby expanding future development and commercial opportunities.
 We believe that our competitive strengths include the following, among other areas:
  
• | LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery technology is applicable to all nucleic acid medicines being developed today that require a formulation: Preclinical studies have shown that LUNAR delivery technology is compatible with different types of nucleic acids therapeutics, including mRNA, self-amplifying mRNA (or replicon), siRNA, microRNA, antisense oligonucleotides and other oligonucleotide therapeutic approaches. We can combine our LUNAR technology with mRNA therapies that encode for a wide array of therapeutic proteins, including transmembrane proteins (such as transporters, GPCRs, and receptors), secreted proteins (such as hormones and antibodies), engineered nucleases (CRISPR and TALEN), engineered antigen receptors (CAR-T) and intracellular proteins (chaperones, enzymes, intrabodies). We also have pre-clinical data demonstrating proof-of-concept for LUNAR delivery of DNA-based vaccines and therapeutics. The broad applicability of our LUNAR delivery technology is a distinct value driver. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery technology is applicable to different tissues and cell types via multiple routes of administration. Most nucleic acid drugs that are marketed or in development are primarily active in liver cells called hepatocytes. Pre-clinical studies have shown that LUNAR can deliver nucleic acid therapies to the liver to hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells via intravenous injection. Our ability to deliver nucleic acid medicines to both of these cell types provides us a distinct advantage over other technologies that preferentially deliver to hepatocytes only, as stellate cells are key contributors to liver disease progression, including fibrosis and liver cancer. We have also demonstrated functional delivery of LUNAR-formulated mRNA to lung cells through nebulized, inhaled administration. This is the foundation of our LUNAR-CF program and may pave the way for additional therapies to treat rare lung disorders. Additionally, preclinical studies in rodents have shown that LUNAR can deliver nucleic acid compounds to muscle cells via intramuscular injection and retinal cells via subretinal injection intravitriol, an injection to the back of the eye. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to repeat dose. Multiple preclinical studies in rodents and non-human primates have shown no reduction in efficacy upon repeat dosing of LUNAR formulated RNA medicines (siRNA or mRNA). We believe this indicates that LUNAR-delivered nucleic acids may not elicit antibody or cell-mediated immunity that can reduce potency upon repeat dosing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Experienced team. Our team has extensive experience in the discovery and development of nucleic acid medicines, as well as experience and know-how in lipid-mediated delivery technology. This combination of in-house expertise uniquely positions us to develop innovative, proprietary novel nucleic acid technologies and nucleic acid medicines.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our intellectual property portfolio. Our LUNAR and nucleic acid technologies are wholly owned by us and covered by our patent portfolio of 152 patents and patent applications, issued in the United States, China, Europe, Japan and other countries. Our intellectual property portfolio serves as a barrier-to-entry for competitors and, since it is wholly-owned and not licensed, does not carry with it down-stream economics which is different than most other pre-clinical stage companies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to develop high barrier-to-entry products with rapid development of subsequent products with lower costs and risks. The properties of our proprietary technologies, outlined above, allow us to develop high barrier-to-entry nucleic acid medicines. We expect that the versatility of our two development platforms will allow us to develop subsequent products relatively quickly with less risk and lower costs.

Key Attributes of Our LUNAR Lipid-Mediated Delivery Technology 
 We have designed our LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery platform to address major challenges with nucleic acid medicine delivery, including transfection efficiency, adverse immune reactions and liver damage. See below for a graphic representation of our LUNAR formulation, where blue spheres represent polyethylene glycol (“PEG”) lipids and the orange, darker orange, and yellow spheres represent the proprietary Arcturus (ATX) lipid excipient and other structural components (phospholipid and cholesterol).  
 Graphic of LUNAR
 

LUNAR formulations are a multi-component, lipid-mediated drug delivery system that utilizes our proprietary lipids, called ATX lipids. Each of our ATX lipids contains an amino head group and a biodegradable lipid backbone. The amino head group is a key chemical component of the ATX lipid, making it pH-sensitive and providing it distinct advantages as a component of our LUNAR formulation. At acidic pH, ATX lipids are positively charged, facilitating interaction with the negatively charged nucleic acid, thereby enabling LUNAR particle formation. At physiological pH (e.g., pH 7.4), LUNAR formulations are neutrally charged, avoiding the toxicity often seen with permanently positively-charged lipid-mediated delivery technology, used by other RNA medicine companies. Upon uptake into a cell, by a process called endocytosis that forms a cellular structure called an endosome around the LUNAR formulated nucleic acid therapeutic, the amino head group again becomes positively charged, disrupting the endosome and the LUNAR particle, and releasing the nucleic acid therapeutic into the cell. 
 11

LUNAR-mediated delivery of a nucleic acid therapeutic into cells
 The disruption of the LUNAR particle also releases the components of the formulation into the cell, where the ATX lipid is degraded by enzymes in the cell allowing for the lipids to be cleared from the cell.  We designed the ATX lipid to be biodegradable by engineering chemical structural components called esters into the ATX backbone that are sensitive to cellular enzymes called esterases. This degradation prevents ATX lipids from accumulating inside the cell and causing toxicity. 
 


LUNAR compatibility with nucleic acids of various size
 We have generated a growing library of over 150 proprietary ATX lipids. ATX lipids are rationally designed to fit the application and vary depending on the target cell type and route of administration. We perform extensive formulation screening for each nucleic acid therapeutic to determine the optimal ATX lipid and LUNAR composition for the particular nucleic acid therapeutic, the desired route of administration and target cell type. We have demonstrated high encapsulating efficiency when formulating a wide range of nucleic acid sizes, 20 to 12,000 nucleotides in length (figure below, left), and particle size was within the acceptable range to maximize targeting and efficacy (figure below, right).

12

LUNAR Scalability
 We have extensively characterized the safety and efficacy profile of first-generation LUNAR 1.0 in rodents and non-human primates and have confirmed its scalability for manufacturing. To test consistency across batch size, we tested batches from 50 milligrams to 30 grams (figure below), and to test reproducibility we tested three different batches of 30 grams each.  In both experiments, we demonstrated the LUNAR formulation process is both scalable and reproducible, maintaining both particle size and encapsulation percentage independent of batch size.
 

LUNAR Reproducibility
 

13

LUNAR In Vivo Proof-of-Concept Data
 LUNAR formulations can be designed to target different cell types in the liver
 We have optimized LUNAR to deliver nucleic acid therapeutics preferentially to different cell types in the liver after intravenous (IV) delivery.  When mice were treated with a single intravenous dose of two different LUNAR-siRNA formulations, significant target mRNA knockdown was observed in hepatocytes 72 hours post-treatment (figure below, left). Shown in green, the composition of a different LUNAR-siRNA formulation was modified to also achieve significant target mRNA knockdown in stellate cells, an important cell type for certain liver indications, such as NASH. The hepatocyte-targeting (formulation 1, red bars) was also used to formulate a green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNA and mice were treated with a single IV dose (figure below, right). 24 hours later, GFP protein was seen throughout the liver, particularly in hepatocytes.


Repeat dose efficacy in non-human primates
 To demonstrate efficacy of LUNAR-mRNA in a repeat-dose setting, we treated non-human primates once weekly for four weeks with LUNAR-formulated erythropoetin (EPO) mRNA (figure below). EPO protein expression levels were determined 6 hours following each treatment, and elevated serum EPO levels were maintained following each treatment.

14

Antigen-specific responses following IM delivery of LUNAR-mRNA in influenza vaccination mouse model
 We have demonstrated in proof-of concept studies in mice the utility of LUNAR-formulated mRNA in oncology and infectious disease vaccine applications. Mice were treated at Day 0 (prime) and Day 21 (boost) via intramuscular delivery with 0.5 mg/kg LUNAR-encapsulated hemagglutinin mRNA (2 formulations; LUNAR 1 and LUNAR 2). At Day 35, serum titers were determined in a hemagglutination inhibition assay (figure below, left) and antigen-specific cytokine production was evaluated from CD8+ T-cells (figure below, right). With both formulations tested, titers between 103-104 were achieved and a significant increase in % of TNFα and IFNα expressing cells was observed.


Our Proprietary mRNA and Protein Design Technology
 Arcturus has developed in-house expertise in protein and mRNA design to benefit the mRNA programs in its pipeline to address many of the known challenges that face the viability of mRNA therapeutics today.  Arcturus has identified several design elements of mRNA compounds that provide improved translation (conversion from mRNA to protein) of our mRNA therapeutics, including untranslated regions derived from species that have not previously been combined with human mRNA sequences.  This platform technology is applicable to many different human mRNA sequences that we currently are approaching in our discovery efforts.  We have also identified ways to engineer human protein sequences to increase the half-life of the proteins produced by our mRNA therapies as well as directing specific types of proteins more efficiently to certain cellular structures of interest.  These innovations are broadly applicable to several programs that are part of our mRNA discovery efforts.  
 In addition to these platform technologies, Arcturus has developed a proprietary tool to aid our team in the efficient design and development of new mRNA drugs.  Arcturus’ mRNA Design Suite is a cloud-based software suite with a collection of proprietary bioinformatic algorithms aimed at achieving highly improved potency of a drug substance through optimization of mRNA sequences.  The algorithms were developed in house through the integration of experimentally validated optimization processes.  Through multi-layered in silico QC pipelines, mRNA Design Suite promptly generates error-free sequences in its highest quality accompanied by various statistics.  Additionally, mRNA Design Suite seamlessly interacts with Arcturus plasmid/mRNA production database to accelerate the process from mRNA design to gene synthesis, cloning, and mRNA production.
 
15

Our Unlocked Nucleic Acid (UNA) Oligomer Chemistry
 UNAs are RNA analogues in which the C2’-C3’ bond of the ribose ring is absent (figure below). UNA chemistry technology can potentially be applied to multiple types of RNA medicines including mRNA, siRNA, microRNA and guide RNAs for gene editing. One or more UNAs can be positioned strategically along a nucleic acid strand to manipulate the chemical properties of the molecule. 
 RNA structure compared with UNA structure
 
UNAs can potentially improve the efficiency and specificity of siRNA-mediated protein suppression. siRNAs are short double-stranded RNA molecules. Once inside the cell, they become part of the RNA-induced silencing complex (“RISC”) and are split into two single siRNA strands. One of these strands stays with RISC and binds to any mRNA with a complementary sequence. If the wrong siRNA strand stays with RISC, it can bind to different mRNAs than the target mRNA and therefore inhibit translation of other proteins. This is an undesired off-target effect and is one of the major barriers to developing effective siRNA medicines. Incorporating a single UNA into siRNA molecules can make one of the strands preferentially bind to RISC improving specificity. Additionally, incorporation of UNA modifications can reduce susceptibility of the siRNA to nuclease degradation, improving the efficiency of siRNA-mediated protein suppression.

We own a comprehensive suite of UNA technology patents for therapeutic and reagent use, enabling us to operate freely and to independently pursue nucleic acid therapeutic candidates incorporating this technology. We are also actively pursuing other novel chemistry technologies with the aim of overcoming the development and therapeutic challenges of nucleic acid medicines. Our goal is to expand our nucleic acid technology portfolio and strengthen our ability to develop safer and more effective nucleic acid therapeutic candidates.
 INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS
 We are developing mRNA therapeutic candidates to treat rare diseases with unmet medical needs through the following two internal development programs.
 16

1.LUNAR-OTC (ARCT-810)
 On February 11, 2019, Arcturus disclosed that the Company will reassume 100% global rights for its flagship asset, clinical development candidate ARCT-810, a mRNA drug to treat OTC Deficiency. The LUNAR-OTC program addresses orinithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, a rare, genetic disease caused by mutations in the OTC gene that leads to dysfunctional or deficient OTC levels. OTC deficiency causes the body to accumulate ammonia levels which are neurotoxic and harmful to the liver.  Currently, there are only treatments to remove excess ammonia and no disease-modifying treatments of the underlying genetic disorder are available.  We use our LUNAR platform to deliver normal OTC mRNA into hepatocytes, where OTC is produced and functions, to produce normal functioning OTC with potentially disease-modifying effects for these patients. 
 Our LUNAR-OTC approach has the potential to treat the underlying defect that causes the debilitating symptoms that OTC deficiency (dysfunctional or decreased levels of OTC protein), rather than mitigating symptoms by sequestration of ammonia which is at high levels in these patients.
 Overview of OTC Deficiency
 OTC deficiency is caused by mutations in the OTC gene which leads to a non-functional or deficient OTC enzyme. OTCD is the most common urea cycle disorder.  Urea cycle disorders are a group of inherited metabolic disorders that make it difficult for afflicted patients to remove toxic waste products as proteins are digested.  OTC deficiency is a life-threatening genetic disease. OTC is a critical enzyme in the urea cycle, which takes place in liver cells, and converts ammonia to urea. This conversion does not occur properly in patients with OTC deficiency and ammonia accumulates in their blood, acting as a neurotoxin and liver toxin. This can cause severe symptoms including vomiting, headaches, coma and death. OTC deficiency is an inherited disease that can cause developmental problems, seizures and death in newborn babies. It is an X-linked disorder, so is more common in boys. Patients with less severe symptoms may present later in life, as adults. There is currently no cure for OTC deficiency, apart from liver transplant. However, this treatment comes with significant risk of complications such as organ rejection, and transplant recipients must take immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of their lives. Current standard of care for OTC patients is a low-protein diet and ammonia scavengers to try and prevent patients from accumulating ammonia. These treatments do not address the underlying cause of disease.
 The LUNAR-OTC Solution
 Our preclinical proof-of-concept studies have shown that LUNAR-delivered human OTC mRNA reduces urinary orotic acid levels in a well-established mouse model of OTC deficiency: OTC-spf ash mice. These mice have elevated urinary orotic acid. Because they have a small amount of residual OTC enzyme activity, they are not hyperammonemic unless challenged with a high protein diet through inhibition of the residual OTC enzyme activity.  
 We treated OTC-spf ash mice, with induced hyperammonemia resulting from a high protein diet, with one intravenous dose of LUNAR-encapsulated human OTC mRNA (candidate mRNA sequences tested at a low, middle, and high dose levels). A LUNAR-encapsulated Luciferase mRNA was included as a control. As shown in the figure below, this single treatment significantly reduced urinary orotic acid levels for at least seven days post-treatment (n=4-6 animals per group).

Functional effects following repeat dosing of LUNAR-encapsulated human OTC mRNA in OTC-spf ash mice were then determined. OTC-spf ash mice were placed on a high-protein diet to induce hyperammonemia and treated with once weekly intravenous doses of LUNAR-encapsulated human OTC mRNA for 5 weeks at 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg with a 2-week washout period.   As shown in the figure below, animals in the 1.0 mg/kg LUNAR-OTC treatment group were completely protected from lethality (n=10 animals per group).
 Survival of OTC-deficient mice on high protein diet following weekly LUNAR-OTC treatment


Our LUNAR-OTC program utilizes our current innovations in protein sequence optimization, mRNA coding region optimization and our proprietary untranslated regions that increase the efficiency of our mRNA therapeutic to translate into protein, the half-life of the OTC protein and also its localization into the mitochondria (a cellular structure) where the OTC protein resides and functions.

2. | LUNAR-CF
---+---------

 The LUNAR-CF program addresses cystic fibrosis, a progressive lung disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. We use our LUNAR platform to deliver optimized CFTR mRNA into airway epithelial cells. This allows airway cells to produce functional CFTR protein using their native translational machinery and protein trafficking pathways.
 This approach has the potential to treat the underlying defect that causes CF (dysfunctional or absent CFTR protein) in all such patients, regardless of mutation type.  The potential has been recognized by Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc. (CFFT), with whom we have partnered to develop this important therapy. 
 Overview of CF
 According to the National Institutes of Health, CF is the most common lethal genetic disease in the United States. Currently, Arcturus is focusing on Class 1 patients which make up approximately 10% of the United States CF population. More than 30,000 people are living with CF in the United States, 70,000 people worldwide, and approximately 1,000 people are newly-diagnosed each year. There are 2,000 known mutations in the CFTR gene that affect the function of the CFTR protein, an ion channel that controls chloride and sodium movement in-and-out of cells. When this channel is absent or dysfunctional, thick mucus can accumulate in airways and pancreatic ducts, which can cause coughing, chronic bacterial infections, inflammation, tissue scarring, digestive problems and other serious complications. The median lifespan for a person with CF in the United States is 37 years, and the cause of death is usually lung damage.
 There are currently no FDA-approved drugs that can treat all 2,000 CFTR mutations. The FDA has approved three CFTR modulator therapies (Kalydeco®, Orkambi® and Symdeko®), to treat fewer than 40 CF-causing mutations. These drugs do not treat the underlying genetic cause of CF, but instead assist the mutant CFTR protein to reach the cell membrane and/or increase the functional ion channel activity of the mutant CFTR protein. For patients with other mutations, palliative treatment, including antibiotics and mucolytics, is the primary standard of care. Many of these patients ultimately suffer from decreased lung function and require lung transplant.
 Our LUNAR-CF Solution
 With the support of CFFT, we are developing an mRNA therapeutic to treat and prevent lung disease in CF patients. Our LUNAR-CF compound comprises normal CFTR mRNA encapsulated by LUNAR delivery technology. This approach is a form of protein replacement therapy as it enables lung cells to produce normal CFTR protein.
 We have completed preclinical proof-of-concept studies, demonstrating that LUNAR efficiently delivers a functional reporter mRNA efficiently into mouse lung epithelial cells in vivo (figure below). Six hours following intratracheal delivery of 0.1 mg/kg of the LUNAR-encapsulated reporter green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNA, GFP protein expression (shown in brown) was observed in mouse lung epithelial cells of the primary bronchus and in bronchioles, important lung structures, located in the upper and lower airways. 
 19

In vivo targeting to lung epithelial cells following treatment with LUNAR-reporter mRNA
 

Through optimization of the CFTR mRNA coding sequence and untranslated regions, we were also able to significantly improve CFTR expression and demonstrate enhanced ion channel activity in an in vitro model system. In cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial (CFBE) cells transfected with a lead candidate CFTR mRNA sequence, protein expression was significantly increased and the duration of expression was prolonged compared to a reference CFTR mRNA which is the natural coding sequence (figure below, left). When the Arcturus lead candidate CFTR mRNA was transfected into FRT epithelial cells (a cell type used to measure conductance in CF research), a significant increase in transepithelial conductance was observed (figure below, right), indicating that the CFTR protein produced from the mRNA is functional. In this study, the same reference CFTR mRNA was included and minimal functional activity was observed, indicating significant improvement of our proprietary mRNA design compared to the natural sequence.

COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS
 In addition to our internal development programs, we have a number of development partnerships structured such that we work to discover siRNA or mRNA therapeutic candidates formulated in our LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery system. We are collaborating with Janssen to develop nucleic acid-based candidates for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and potentially other infectious or respiratory diseases, with SGI to enable their self-replicating RNA technology for animal and human vaccines and therapeutics, with Takeda to develop nucleic acid therapeutic candidates for NASH and other gastrointestinal disorders, with Ultragenyx to develop mRNA therapeutic candidates for rare disease targets and with CureVac to develop mRNA therapeutic and vaccine candidates for various indications. We have also received funding from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc., or CFFT, to support our LUNAR-CF development program, which is described above.
Janssen Agreement
 On October 18, 2017, we entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement (“Janssen Agreement”) with Janssen to address hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an RNA approach. Under this agreement, we are collaborating with Janssen to create therapeutics intended to treat HBV, and at Janssen’s option, other infectious or respiratory disease viruses. Both parties to the Janssen Agreement will carry out their respective research obligations pursuant to agreed upon joint research plans. Janssen may select certain therapeutics in the field for further development by the parties under a joint research plan subject to the terms of the Janssen agreement. Following these joint research efforts, if Janssen selects a development candidate, we will grant to Janssen an exclusive license to the development candidate. As a part of this agreement with Janssen, we will not engage in research independent of this agreement with Janssen for HBV or other disease areas in which Janssen has exercised its option rights to products in the therapeutic area.  
 The Janssen agreement provides that Janssen will develop the licensed development candidates, obtain certain regulatory approvals and commercialize products containing the development candidates. With respect to rights in infectious and respiratory diseases, Janssen also has an option to have us develop and license therapeutics for infectious and respiratory disease viruses, provided that we may collaborate with third parties and license any rights in the option disease areas to third parties so long as Janssen has not exercised its option rights to products in the therapeutic area. Under the Janssen Agreement, both parties also grant each other certain non-exclusive, royalty-free licenses to conduct the research under the agreement.
 Under the Janssen Agreement, Janssen paid us an up-front fee in the mid $5 million to $10 million range. On a development candidate-by-development candidate basis, Janssen will pay us certain development milestone payments of up to $56.5 million for each of the first two products in HBV and in each indication for which Janssen exercises an option. In addition, Janssen will pay us multiple sales milestone payments in the $20 million to $40 million range if specified annual net sales milestones are achieved by Janssen, on a research program-by-research program basis for the first calendar year in which such net sales milestones have been achieved. Janssen will also pay option exercise fees within the $1 to $5 million range, depending on timing of the election to include either of the option fields. In addition, Janssen will pay royalties on annual net sales of licensed products up to mid-single digits range, subject to reduction on a country-by-country and licensed-product-by-licensed-product basis and subject to certain events, such as expiration of program patents.
 The Janssen Agreement will terminate when no further royalty payments on any licensed products are payable. Janssen may terminate the Janssen Agreement at any time on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, or in its entirety, in each case upon 60 days’ written notice.
 Ultragenyx Agreement
 On October 26, 2015, we and Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement, as amended on October 17, 2017 and April 20, 2018 (the “Ultragenyx Agreement”). Ultragenyx initially selected two development targets, including Glycogen Storage Disease III, and the parties agreed to a list of eight additional reserved targets related to rare diseases for which Ultragenyx has the exclusive right to evaluate for collaborative development. During the reserved target exclusivity period Ultragenyx may substitute a reserved target for a selected target, and/or exercise an expansion option by payment to us, whereby a reserved target will be deemed an additional target (and will preclude an additional reserved target in place of the converted reserved target). Further, during the reserved target exclusivity period, Ultragenyx may replace a reserved target with a proposed new target, subject to certain conditions including whether we have the ability to partner such new target.
 21

The Ultragenyx Agreement additionally provides for limitations on our activities with third parties utilizing LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery technology with respect to a development target for a specified period of time. During the reserved target exclusivity period, we have agreed to exclusivity with respect to any product containing mRNA, including modified mRNA, or UNA oligomer with respect to such reserved target, and will first offer Ultragenyx a right of first negotiation for any other RNA product or a product utilizing the LUNAR delivery technology with respect to such reserved target. The reserved target restrictions terminate upon expiration of the reserved target exclusivity period for each target, which may be extended on a reserved target-by-reserved target basis upon payment of an exclusivity extension fee. 
 On a reserved target-by-reserved target basis, following the target exclusivity period, Ultragenyx receives an exclusive right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive license to exploit RNA products with respect to such reserved target. Following the reserved target right of first negotiation period, if the parties have not entered into an agreement during a specified time period, the rights of Ultragenyx terminate and we may grant a license or enter into a third-party arrangement with respect to such reserved target.
 Under the Ultragenyx Agreement, Ultragenyx receives a co-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable license under our technology and collaboration technology to conduct collaborative development of development targets, compounds and products. The license remains in effect for a specified option period based upon development plan milestones being achieved with respect to development targets and reserved targets and compounds and products with respect to such development targets and reserved targets. If Ultragenyx exercises its option with respect to a development target and the parties enter into a license agreement, Ultragenyx receives an exclusive (even as to us), royalty bearing, sublicenseable (subject to certain limitations), license under our technology and collaboration technology to exploit compound and products with respect to such development target. 
 For development and reserved targets that revert to us, we will pay Ultragenyx royalties on net sales of discontinued targets on a country-by-country basis, until the expiration of the last valid claim or the product-specific patents or patent rights licensed by Ultragenyx to us covering such discontinued targets. Such royalties depend on the state of development of the corresponding discontinued target, set in the low-single digits range.
 Ultragenyx paid us an upfront fee of $10 million. We are entitled to certain additional payments upon exercise of the Ultragenyx expansion option and/or exclusivity extension (if any), and for costs incurred by us in conducting the activities assigned to us under each collaboration development plan. In addition, on a development target-by-development target basis, Ultragenyx will pay us a one-time milestone payment after the first optimized lead designation for the first product with respect of such development target. For each development target for which Ultragenyx exercises its option, Ultragenyx will pay us a one-time option exercise fee based upon on the total number of development targets for which option exercises have been made by Ultragenyx. The option exercise fee is subject to reduction if a development target does not, for example, utilize RNA delivery technology covered by our patent or a nucleic acid chemistry technology covered by our patent. Ultragenyx will also pay us certain milestone payments in the maximum amount of $49 million per development target with respect to clinical/regulatory development, and a maximum amount of $90 million per development target with respect to commercialization, in each case subject to reduction if such product does not utilize RNA delivered technology covered by our patent. Ultragenyx will pay royalties as a percentage of net sales on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis during the applicable royalty term up to 10%.
 The Ultragenyx Agreement provides that each party owns their respective collaboration know-how and collaboration patents and jointly own all joint collaboration know-how and joint collaboration patents, provided that Ultragenyx owns all right, title and interest in and to all collaboration technology that specifically relates to (a) the composition or formulation of a particular compound or product, or (b) any method of using, making or administering a particular compound or product. Further, we will own all improvements to LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery technology and/or UNA oligomer chemistry.
 The Ultragenyx Agreement expires on the last-to-expire royalty term for the last product on a development target-by-development target basis, unless earlier terminated. Upon expiration with respect to a particular development target, the licenses to Arcturus know-how granted to Ultragenyx to exploit products with respect to such development target will be fully paid-up, irrevocable and exclusive. On a target-by-target basis, Ultragenyx has the right to terminate for convenience with respect to such target upon 60 days written notice. 
 22

Synthetic Genomics Agreement
 On October 24, 2017, we entered into a Research and Exclusive License Agreement with Synthetic Genomics, Inc. (the “Synthetic Genomics Agreement”). Under the Synthetic Genomics Agreement, we will carry out research relating to our LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery for specifically agreed research programs in the area of self-replicating mRNA. 
 We granted Synthetic Genomics an exclusive, worldwide license, under our intellectual property related to LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery, to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize for vaccine and human therapeutic self-amplifying RNA products but expressly excluding diagnosis, prophylaxis and treatment of respiratory disease viruses other than influenza. 
 Each party retains ownership rights over intellectual property invented jointly by Synthetic Genomics and us (with inventorship determined by U.S. patent law). Under the Synthetic Genomics Agreement, we own all LUNAR product manufacturing process and process technology within any jointly invented program intellectual property (pursuant to an assignment by Synthetic Genomics of its interest in the joint intellectual property). Synthetic Genomics owns all other intellectual property conceived by or for us or jointly invented in performing any research plan that is not expressly assigned to us. Synthetic Genomics will reimburse us for labor costs and pay us a percentage of all cash payments received from any sublicense for a LUNAR product, in the mid 10% to 20% range, less payments made to third parties to obtain the right to practice intellectual property used to develop or necessary to make, use, or sell all or part of licensed LUNAR product (which reduction may not exceed 50% of the aggregate amount paid to us with respect to a specific LUNAR product for any calendar quarter). 
 If Synthetic Genomics enters into a LUNAR research agreement with a third party, does not develop a LUNAR product with such third party, but subsequently licenses non-LUNAR products to and develops non-LUNAR products with such third party, then Synthetic Genomics will pay us a percentage of the consideration received for such non-LUNAR product in the 5% to 10% range. In the event that Synthetic Genomics desires to sell LUNAR products for which it obtains marketing approval, the Synthetic Genomics Agreement provides that we and Synthetic Genomics will negotiate in good faith with respect to the economics for that specific product opportunity.
 Under the Synthetic Genomics Agreement, in order to maintain exclusive rights, Synthetic Genomics must achieve certain specified milestones or pay us annual exclusivity maintenance fees.
 Unless earlier terminated, the agreement with Synthetic Genomics continues in full force and effect until the expiration, abandonment, or termination of the last valid claim of a patent within the licensed intellectual property, provided that, the agreement will terminate on the seventh anniversary of the effective date if the agreement becomes non-exclusive and neither Synthetic Genomics nor its sublicensee have achieved specified preclinical milestones within designated time periods. In addition, Synthetic Genomics has the right to terminate the agreement for convenience on ninety (90) days’ written notice.
 Takeda Agreement
 On December 6, 2016, we entered into a Research Agreement with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda (collectively, “Takeda”), as amended December 21, 2017 (the “Takeda Agreement”). Under the agreement with Takeda, we and Takeda are conducted a research program (“Research Program”) to discover siRNA medicine(s) for the treatment of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (“NASH”). We intend to develop siRNA compounds formulated in LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery technology for in vivo studies. The Takeda agreement stated that for the initial research term, which has a stated end date of December 20, 2018 (“Research Term”), Takeda received a non-exclusive and worldwide license, with a right to sub-license, our technology for the purpose of conducting the research program under our agreement. We have further agreed, for the period of two years after the Research Term, not to engage in any research or development activities for which LUNAR and UNA oligomers are used against the same NASH target that is the subject of the Research Program. On March 8, 2019, the Company entered into a Research Collaboration Agreement with Takeda for the purpose of designing, optimizing and manufacturing LUNAR®-formulated mRNA Therapeutics.
 23

Providence Agreement
 On March 16, 2016, we entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement with a related party, Providence (the “Providence Agreement”), whose CEO and President is also a shareholder of the Company, to identify and optimize microRNA modulators or mimetics for the treatment of neoplastic diseases. In April 2017, the Providence Agreement was amended to include mRNA for the treatment of neoplastic disease. In July 2018, the Providence Agreement was amended and restated to cover brain neoplasms, breast neoplasms and ovarian neoplasms.  Each party is responsible for their own research costs under the agreement, and Providence is responsible for all of the development costs through the completion of Phase 2 clinical trials. We are entitled to share in future product revenue of each product provided we share in the product’s post Phase 2 costs. Separately, Providence has agreed to pay a specified rate for the use of our employees. 
 CureVac Agreements
  
1. | Development and Option Agreement
---+---------------------------------

 On January 1, 2018, we entered into a Development and Option Agreement with CureVac AG (“CureVac”), which was amended on May 3, 2018, as restated in the Restated Amendment to the Development and Option Agreement on September 28, 2018 (such agreement, as amended by the restated amendment, the “Development and Option Agreement”). Under the terms of the Development and Option Agreement, CureVac and Arcturus agreed to conduct joint preclinical development programs and we granted CureVac a license on pre-agreed license terms, with respect to targets to be identified during the term of our agreement, to develop and commercialize certain products incorporating our patents and know-how related to delivery systems based on or incorporating lipid-mediated delivery systems (including the LUNAR® platform) (the “Arcturus LMD Technology”), and CureVac patents and know-how related to mRNA technology. Under the terms of the Development and Option Agreement, we granted to CureVac a worldwide, non-exclusive license to use the Arcturus LMD Technology, including the right to grant sublicenses, for the purpose of conducting research and preclinical development activities, subject to certain limitations. In addition, CureVac granted to us a worldwide, non-exclusive license under its mRNA technology, solely to the extent necessary to execute the activities contemplated by the agreement. Subject to certain restrictions, the parties will have an undivided one-half interest in the patents and know-how developed jointly by the parties during the course of the agreement. Pursuant to a May 2018 amendment to the Development and Option Agreement (which as noted above was amended and restated on September 28, 2018), we increased the number of targets available to CureVac under the Development and Option Agreement and agreed upon the license forms to be executed upon selection of the targets by CureVac.
 In consideration for the rights granted under the agreement, we received an upfront fee from CureVac. Each development program will be subject to the terms of a work plan under which the parties will use diligent efforts to develop defined products. CureVac may designate certain targets as reserved targets, subject to certain pre-existing restrictions. CureVac has licenses from us for a pre-defined number of targets to use the Arcturus LMD Technology for the development and commercialization of products. To the extent a reserved target is only available on a nonexclusive basis, CureVac may elect to enter into a non-exclusive license agreement. Such licenses shall be obtained under separate, pre-negotiated forms of license agreements to be entered into by the parties upon identification of the targets. If CureVac identifies a target pursuant to the agreement, it will be required to pay us a fee for an exclusive license – or non-exclusive license, as applicable – based on whether the target is a rare disease target or non-rare disease targets. Pursuant to the form of exclusive license agreement, if CureVac achieves all development and commercialization milestones with respect to the licensed product developed for an identified target, CureVac will be required to pay certain development and regulatory approval milestones depending on whether the target is a rare disease target or non-rare disease target. CureVac will also be required to pay us low single-digit royalties on the net sales of each product falling under a license agreement on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis. Such royalties are subject to reduction for third party payments with respect to licensed products or if there is no valid claim under the licensed patents, but may not fall below a specified percentage if the licensed product during the royalty term is not covered by a licensed patent. Further, if within 24 months after the license agreement effective date, CureVac grants a sublicense to a third party under the license agreement for the development and commercialization of licensed products, then CureVac will pay us a single-digit percentage of the total sublicense income actually received by CureVac to the extent the sublicense income exceeds the fee paid by CureVac under the Development and Option Agreement to identify a target for this license agreement and the milestone payments paid by CureVac under this license agreement. The fees, milestones and royalty payments for a non-exclusive license are fifty percent (50%) of the corresponding payments for an exclusive license. 
 24

The Development and Option Agreement has an initial term of eight years unless earlier terminated or extended in accordance with its terms. Within 60 days prior to the expiration of the initial term, CureVac has the option to extend the initial term of the agreement on an annual basis for up to a total of three successive years upon payment to us of an annual non-refundable extension fee. CureVac has the right to terminate the agreement in full or on a program-by-program basis (i) in the event of material breach by us that is not cured within the cure period specified in the agreement, (ii) in the event of a change in control of Arcturus or (iii) without cause upon 60 days’ notice to us. We have the right to terminate the agreement upon material breach by CureVac that is not cured within the period specified by the agreement. Upon termination, all licenses granted under the agreement will terminate, but any license agreement entered into pursuant upon the identification of a target will remain in effect.
  
2. | Co-Development and Co-Commercialization Agreement
---+--------------------------------------------------

 Concurrently with the Development and Option Agreement, we entered into a Co-Development and Co-Commercialization Agreement with CureVac (the “Co-Development Agreement”). Pursuant to the Co-Development Agreement, the overall collaboration will be managed by a joint steering committee. The parties also have the option to co-develop two mRNA programs for CureVac and one mRNA program for us, including targets for such programs selected from the reserved target list established under the Development and Option Agreement. 
 Unless earlier terminated, the Co-Development Agreement shall continue in full force and effect on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the commercialization party no longer sells product in such country, or with respect to opt-out products, the expiration of the royalty term for such product in accordance with the terms of the agreement. A program initiated pursuant to the Co-Development Agreement may be earlier terminated (i) by CureVac with respect to an Arcturus program and by Arcturus with respect to a CureVac program, for convenience upon 180 days written notice, or (ii) by either party in the event of material breach, if the breaching party has not cured such breach within the applicable cure period. The Co-Development Agreement may be earlier terminated by either party in the event the other party commences legal action against the terminating party challenging the scope of the non-challenging party’s patents. 
 On February 11, 2019, the Company announced the termination of the obligations of CureVac for the preclinical development of ARCT-810, effective 180 days from February 5, 2019 and the re-assumption by the Company of the worldwide rights thereto.  Arcturus will reassume 100% global rights for its flagship asset, clinical development candidate ARCT-810, a messenger RNA (mRNA) drug to treat ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. ARCT-810 was previously subject to a 50/50 collaboration between Arcturus and CureVac AG under the Co-Development Agreement. CureVac elected not to continue its obligations for the preclinical development of ARCT-810 under and pursuant to the terms of the collaboration, which will be effective in the third quarter of 2019.
 Pursuant to the terms of the Co-Development Agreement, CureVac is obligated to continue to fund its share of the preclinical expenses for the OTC program into August of 2019.  
 25

OTHER MATERIAL AGREEMENTS
The Company has certain other material agreements, including the Protiva Agreement and CFFT Agreement discussed below.
 Protiva Agreement
 On August 9, 2013, Marina Biotech, Inc. (“Marina”) assigned certain intellectual property, including patents, inventions and patent-related information related to UNA oligonucleotide therapeutics to us pursuant to a Patent Assignment and License Agreement, as well as Marina’s rights and obligations under a License Agreement with Protiva Biotherapeutics Inc. (“Protiva”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Arbutus Biopharma Corporation, dated November 28, 2012 (the “Protiva Agreement”). The intellectual property licensed from Marina and Protiva is a significant component of our UNA oligomer chemistry platform. As partial consideration for the assignment from Marina, we granted Marina a royalty-free, fully-paid, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive license to use the inventions, ideas and information embodied in the assigned patents to develop, make, use and sell chemical compounds intended for human and animal therapeutic uses (including certain rights to sublicense in connection with continuing research, development and/or commercialization). We also paid an upfront fee to Marina and agreed to maintain the assigned patents in certain countries. 
 Under the assigned Protiva Agreement, we granted Protiva a non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide license with certain rights to sublicense (in connection with continuing research, development and/or commercialization) to exploit our patents, know-how and inventions relating to our technology for purposes of the development of human therapeutics. Protiva will pay us milestone payments with an aggregate value of up to $3.25 million for each Protiva product directed to a specific gene target, upon achievement of certain development milestones with respect to each such product and target. If, instead, Protiva sublicenses the commercialization rights for a Protiva product, then Protiva will pay us a percentage of sublicense revenues paid to Protiva by such sublicensee, depending on the development stage of such Protiva product at the time of sublicense. In addition, Protiva will pay us royalties on net sales of Protiva products during the royalty term depending on the type of product, on a country-by-country basis. For licensed Protiva products, royalties will be paid in the low single digit range on net sales for such product, subject to reduction on net sales for such product in the event there is no patent coverage or generic products are introduced with respect to such Protiva product. A royalty reduction for a Protiva product will also apply if Protiva is required to license third party intellectual property to commercialize such product, subject to a floor for such reductions.
 The Protiva Agreement term, for a particular Protiva product in a particular country, will expire (on a country-by-country basis) upon the earlier of (i) the expiration of the royalty term for such Protiva product in such country or (ii) the end of the calendar quarter in which sales in such country of generic products exceed a certain amount compared to sales of Protiva products in such country. The Protiva Agreement will expire in its entirety upon expiration of the last royalty term for any of our patents with respect to which Protiva has a license under the Protiva Agreement, unless earlier terminated. Protiva may terminate the Protiva Agreement for convenience in its entirety, or for a particular country or countries, upon ninety days’ prior written notice to Arcturus.
 Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Agreement
 On May 16, 2017, CFFT awarded us with funds for a development program to identify lead CFTR mRNA sequences and LUNAR formulations, demonstrate tolerability of LUNAR CFTR mRNA, and demonstrate translatability of aerosolized LUNAR (the “CFFT Agreement”). The award of approximately $3.1 million will be received according to a milestone schedule and unused funds will be retained by CFFT. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the development program, and after the completion of a development program, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to develop the product. The award includes a grant of rights under CFFT know-how to assist us to research, develop, commercialize, make or otherwise exploit a product. 
 If the award results in a successful product, we will pay CFFT a specified payment amount in installments following commercialization based on a formula that is a single-digit multiple of the total award amount, plus a payment equal to the awarded payments, after aggregate net sales of the product exceed certain thresholds. Further, in the event of a license, sale or other transfer of the product or our development program technology (including a change of control transaction), we will pay CFFT a percentage of such transfer payments actually received by us or our shareholders (subject to a royalty cap). 
 26

CFFT has an interruption license right under the CFFT Agreement so that if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a product for a certain time period before the first commercial sale of the product, CFFT may, upon written notice of such interruption to us and our failure to effectively deny such interruption or cure such interruption as set forth in the CFFT Agreement, exercise certain rights pursuant to procedures set forth in the CFFT Agreement. CFFT’s interruption license rights include, in certain cases, payments from us to CFFT, or the grant of an exclusive (even as to us), worldwide license to CFFT under our development program technology solely to the extent necessary to manufacture, have manufactured, license, use, sell, offer to sell, and support the product in the field of treatment of cystic fibrosis and other pulmonary diseases.
 All inventions, data, know-how, information, results, analyses and other intellectual property rights resulting from the development program will be owned by us, and subject to certain exceptions, CFFT assigns and transfers to us all of CFFT’s right, title, and interest in and to all inventions and other intellectual property resulting from the development program.
 Either party may terminate the CFFT Agreement for cause (e.g., material breach by the other party of its covenants or obligations).
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 Our business success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our proprietary technologies, inventions and know-how, and on its ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We strive to protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements with employees, advisors, consultants and contractors.
 We rely on continuing technological innovation to strengthen our proprietary position in the field of nucleic acid medicines. Therefore, we plan to continue to file patent applications in jurisdictions around the world as we discover and develops novel nucleic acid technology platforms and novel nucleic acid therapeutic candidates. We cannot guarantee that future applications will be issued.
 Our Patent Portfolio
 As of March 1, 2019, we are the sole owner of 152 patents and pending patent applications including 18 U.S. patents, 24 pending U.S. patent applications, 7 pending international applications under Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”), 44 foreign patents and 59 pending foreign patent applications. The claims of these patents and pending applications include compositions of matter, methods of use, manufacturing process and drug product formulations. These claims cover the use of our core platform technologies including the use of LUNAR and lipid components to deliver nucleic acid, the use of UNA oligomers for therapeutics and reagents, and the use of LNA oligomers for therapeutics. Claims also cover the composition of matter and use of our therapeutic candidates to treat target diseases including HBV and NASH. Our issued patents are expected to expire between 2028 and 2038, without taking into account any possible patent term extensions.
 Our patent portfolio includes the following patents and pending patent applications for LUNAR, UNA and the use of LNA in certain RNA medicines:
  
• | LUNAR – As of March 1, 2019, we own 10 U.S. patents, 8 U.S. pending patent applications, 3 international applications (PTC), and 29 foreign pending patent applications covering the composition of matter and use of our LUNAR technology for nucleic acid delivery and drug delivery.

Our patent portfolio includes a filing covering our LUNAR-OTC program, specifically our engineered OTC protein and our optimized mRNA sequence that encodes for the engineered OTC protein.  This patent application will have a term until 2040 without extension. 
 Patent Terms
 The term of individual patents depends on the countries in which they are obtained. The patent term is 20 years from the earliest effective date of filing a non-provisional patent application in most of the countries in which we file.
 Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act), U.S. patent holders can apply for a patent term extension to compensate for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent extension is only available for patents covering FDA-approved drugs. The extension can be up to five years beyond the original expiration date of the patent and cannot extend a patent term for longer than 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent extension is granted per approved drug. Similar provisions may be available in foreign jurisdictions including Europe. Arcturus intends to apply for patent term extensions where possible.
 We also rely on trade secrets to protect our product candidates. Our commercial success also depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, please see Item 1A “Risk Factors” – “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to:
  
• | preserve trade secrets;
--+------------------------


• | prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties, both in the United States and internationally.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors or other contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
