Item 1. Business
Overview
PagerDuty is a digital operations management platform that manages urgent and mission-critical work for a modern, digital business. We empower teams to respond rapidly to incidents to resolve or avoid customer issues, reduce noise, predict and avoid performance degradation, improve productivity, and accelerate digital transformation. 
Today, nearly every business is a digital business. As such, organizations are under pressure to enhance their digital operations in order to meet escalating customer expectations, resolve incidents proactively, and free-up time for innovation projects. This means critical, time sensitive, and unpredictable work needs to be detected and orchestrated.
We collect data and digital signals from virtually any software-enabled system or device and leverage powerful machine learning to correlate, process, and predict opportunities and issues. Using incident response, event management, and automation, we bring together the right people with the right information so they can resolve issues and act on opportunities in minutes or seconds from wherever they are.
PagerDuty was founded to support the DevOps movement by breaking down silos between technical teams, like developers and operators, enabling a culture of accountability and collaboration. Our platform’s initial focus was on the software developers who are the owners and architects of the customers’ digital experience and enterprises’ digital transformation. To drive adoption and earn trust within the developer community, our platform is designed to find, adopt, and scale with a rapid return on investment (“ROI”) for our users. 
Since our founding in 2009, we have expanded our capabilities from a single product focused on on-call management for developers to a multi-product platform that crosses silos into IT operations, security, customer service, and executive stakeholder roles across an organization. We have evolved from an on-call tool into the platform for digital operations, which resides at the center of a company’s technology ecosystem.
We have spent more than a decade building deep product integrations to our platform, and our ecosystem now includes over 650 direct integrations to enable our customers to gather and correlate digital signals from any system or device. This allows technical teams to collect digital signals from any system or platform in their environment, and without the effects of context switching. Those same integrations connect with popular collaboration tools and business applications as well as all types of technology stacks to drive automation of work.
We generate revenue primarily from cloud-hosted subscription fees. We also generate revenue from term-license software subscription fees. We have a land-and-expand business model that leads to viral adoption of our products and subsequent expansion. Our online self-service model is the primary mechanism for landing new customers and enabling teams to get started without assistance. We complement our self-service model with high-velocity inside sales focused on small and medium businesses, a commercial team focused on mid-market customers, and a field sales team focused on enterprise customers. Our mid-market and enterprise customers account for the majority of our revenue today. These teams drive expansion to additional users, new use cases, and add-on products, as well as the upsell to higher value plans.
Our business has experienced rapid growth since our inception. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 and 2021, our revenue was $281.4 million and $213.6 million, respectively. We continue to invest in our business and had a net loss of $107.5 million and $68.9 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Our Platform and Key Customer Benefits
We have invested aggressively in research and development to build innovative products that deliver value to our customers. Our cloud-native platform is differentiated based on a broad range of attributes:
•Built for real time. Our platform manages today’s complex and contemporary digital services. These are hybrid cloud and microservice based environments that are constantly changing state. That requires managing the entire service lifecycle from collecting data, interpreting digital signals, mobilizing a response when needed, and providing insights—all in real time. There is no concept of queued tickets or queued work on our platform because we are built to understand these situations and solve incidents within seconds or minutes, not hours or days.
•Nearly 13 years’ of data from over 14,500 paying customers. As pioneers in digital operations management, we have a rich repository of machine-generated data and human response data. We utilize our data from every incident and leverage it across our platform, allowing us to build advanced machine-learning capabilities, provide richer contextual insights to teams, and share in-depth analytics, benchmarking, and best practices with our customers.
•Over 650 integrations across the technology ecosystem. We have invested extensively in an ecosystem that includes over 650 integrations, allowing us to harness data from software-enabled systems and devices. We have deep integrations to a range of widely used technologies, such as Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), Datadog, HashiCorp, New Relic, and Splunk, and many integrations such as Atlassian, Microsoft VSTS, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Slack are bi-directional. Our integrations support a broad range of use cases including developers, IT, security, customer service and support, and other business functions. We provide capabilities through which our users can easily build integrations themselves and connect our products with other third-party technologies.
•Breadth of functionality. We provide our customers with a complete platform that spans end-to-end digital operations management needs: harness digital data, make sense of data, automate, respond and engage teams, and analyze and learn from a team’s actions. We have continued to extend our core capabilities around on-call management and modern incident response to include AI Ops and automation. We have embedded machine learning, automation, insights, and best practices across our products to help our customers realize value quickly.
•Proactive. We are leading a shift from efficient response to proactive and predictive action to help teams prevent incidents from occurring.
•Combine process automation and team mobilization. We combine process automation technology with team mobilization to serve up a proposed automation routine to the right responder, with the option to initiate it with the click of a button. This enables tier one responders with easy press-button automation of powerful remediation steps to cut critical minutes out of outages and incidents.
•Secure, resilient, and scalable. Our customers depend on us for their digital operations needs. When their systems fail, we need to be operational. We have built multiple redundancies into our infrastructure, including multiple cloud regions, communications network, and a single DNS provider from a leading cloud provider. We run entirely in production, with no maintenance windows, so our customers can rely on always-on delivery. We have delivered 99.9% uptime to our customers over the past 24 months. Security is a critical customer requirement, and we have adopted governance, access control, and vulnerability testing to support the needs of our most sophisticated customers.
•Designed for the user. Our software is instant on and easy to adopt and use. We provide a simple, self-service onboarding experience so teams can be up and running in minutes. Our products are mobile-first and include intuitive navigation. Customers can easily extend our platform across teams and multiple use cases within an organization.
•Technology agnostic. We are agnostic to our customer’s technology stack and provide them the choice to use the technologies that meet their needs. We are flexible, modular, and open in our approach to building our platform with a powerful API to enable rapid integrations into even the most complex environments. Our open technology and broad range of integrations ensures that we can effectively co-exist with our customer’s technology.
•Enhanced productivity. PagerDuty empowers the full ROI of our customers’ technology stack, using machine learning, automation, auto-remediation, and self-healing to bring together the right people with the right information to generate the appropriate action, in real time, when seconds matter.
The PagerDuty Operations Platform consists of the following products, which empowers teams to address broader digital operations management requirements.
•PagerDuty Modern Incident Response. PagerDuty Modern Incident Response provides a real-time view across the status of a digital service while incorporating noise reduction to remove false positives. When an incident does occur, task automation automates diagnostics and remediation wherever possible. If human intervention is required, it provides advanced incident response capabilities to quickly identify and mobilize the right responders while equipping responders with context, recommendations, and remediation to accelerate resolution of issues.
•PagerDuty Rundeck Automation. PagerDuty Rundeck Automation empowers users with the ability to create automated workflows and runbooks that span different scripts, tools, APIs, and system commands to safely hand off the knowledge required to use these tools correctly and consistently. With this self-service functionality, organizations can safely extend operations privileges to other teams and business units.
•PagerDuty Event Intelligence. PagerDuty Event Intelligence (AI Ops) applies machine learning to correlate and automate the identification of incidents from billions of events. Event Intelligence groups related events into a single incident, performs advanced suppression to prevent notification of non-actionable events, and continuously learns from similar incidents to provide teams better context and insight. Our Event Intelligence capabilities allow teams to reduce manual work and be more productive.
•PagerDuty for Customer Service. PagerDuty for Customer Service makes it easy to orchestrate, automate, and scale your response to customer impacting issues. With real-time data, two-way communication, and a fully integrated tool stack, we provide what our customers need to act as a unit and resolve issues faster. During an incident, customers receive proactive and clear information on service status, resolution activities, and even the ability to escalate, right from within today’s most populated case management platforms.
Our Growth Strategies
•Land new customers. We will continue to target new customers by leveraging our trusted brand and efficient go-to-market strategy that combines self-serve viral adoption with a focused direct sales effort. We will continue to build on our partner ecosystem to drive awareness and adoption of our products. We will continue to target our potential customers with community building and marketing programs that include digital campaigns, our annual user conference, broader industry events, customer marketing activities, and user meet-ups.
•Expand usage within our existing customer base across development, IT operations, security operations, customer service and support, as well as with new user groups such as business and industrial operations. Development and IT professionals often make an initial purchase of our platform for a small number of users and then expand users over time. We will continue to work with customers to demonstrate how additional users can help accelerate organizational benefits. We see significant growth opportunities within the development, IT operations, security operations, and customer service. We intend to increase our inside and field sales and customer success efforts as well as leverage partners to continue to drive adoption across our existing customers.
•Introduce new products and functionality. We will continue to make investments in research and development to bolster our existing products, increase the reach of our integrations, and innovate on our platform. Our expanding portfolio of products provides us additional opportunities to upsell and 
cross-sell into our customer base. In addition to internal development, we can expand our product portfolio and offerings through acquisitions.
•Grow our international presence. We intend to build on our success to date and grow our sales outside North America, particularly throughout EMEA, Asia Pacific, and Japan. The self-service, low friction nature of our offering allows us to expand our reach into other regions where we see significant opportunity. Our international operations generated 24% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.
Our Market Opportunity
Our platform has demonstrated core use cases across development, IT operations, customer service and support, and security operations. We estimated that in 2021, there were approximately 72 million potential users worldwide in the development, IT operations, customer service and support, and security operations segments, comprised of approximately: 
•22.0 million development personnel
•20.8 million IT operations personnel
•27.4 million customer service and support personnel
•1.6 million security operations personnel
We estimate our total addressable market is over $36 billion. To calculate our total addressable market, we multiply our estimate of 72 million potential users by our applicable product average revenue per user. We believe that we have less than 1% penetration worldwide within these markets. In addition to our core use cases, we are seeing customers use our platform across their business operations and industrial operations. 
Customer Success
We are committed to the success of our customers. This means delivering performance improvements that enable our customers to drive their digital initiatives. The key to delivering recurring value is rapid implementation with a focus on continuous improvement throughout our relationship. We assist our customers by enhancing their ability to operate in real time via cross functional workflows in engineering, IT, security, customer support, executive leadership, and across their entire employee base.
Companies are typically on a digital operations maturity journey that we model in five stages: manual, reactive, responsive, proactive, and preventative. In our view, the majority of organizations are in one of the first three stages, which means issues are primarily discovered only through customer reports. 
To assist companies in the advancement of their digital journeys, our Customer Success team is structured to provide expertise through the entire customer lifecycle from onboarding, adoption of our platform, business value realization and renewal. We provide in-depth instructor-led courses to certify our customers and partners on products, technology, and best practices. The support teams respond to our customers’ queries related to our products via a multi-channel environment from no-fee to paid 24/7 support with service-level agreements. Technical industry experts, architects, and consultants assist customers with rapid deployment with workflow optimization and PagerDuty best practices. The renewals team works proactively to reduce churn/downgrade and provide customers with a positive on-time renewal experience.
Research and Development
Our research and development team consists of our user experience, product management, and engineering teams and technical operations. These groups are responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of new technologies and features for our platform. They are also responsible for scaling our platform and maintaining our cloud infrastructure. We invest substantial resources in research and development to drive core technology 
innovation and bring new products to market. Our distributed research and development efforts enable us to attract the best talent across our multiple locations, including San Francisco, Atlanta, Toronto, London, and Sydney.
Sales and Marketing
We employ a highly efficient go-to-market strategy that combines viral adoption through word of mouth, user-centric content marketing, and grass roots brand development with a high-velocity inside sales model that drives both the initial land of new customers and the subsequent expansion into broader use cases, increased users, and premium functionality. We also target senior IT and business operations management at companies from mid-market to the largest enterprises through inside and field sales strategies to pursue larger-scale deployments.
Our global sales teams focus on both new customer acquisition and up-selling and cross-selling additional products to our existing customers. Our sales teams are organized by geography, consisting of the Americas, EMEA, Asia Pacific, and Japan, as well as by target organization size.
We offer a four-tiered range of pricing plans aligned with our customers’ needs and the maturity of their digital operations: Professional, Business, and Digital Operations. Rundeck automation is a stand-alone offering available on a term-license software subscription basis. We also offer a “freemium” plan for less than five users to introduce new users to the PagerDuty platform.
We use diverse marketing tactics to engage with prospective customers, including email marketing, event marketing, digital advertising, social media, public relations, and community initiatives. We also host and present at regional, national, and global events, including our PagerDuty Summit, to engage both customers and prospects, deliver product training, share best practices, and foster community. Our technical leaders and evangelists frequently speak as subject matter experts at market-leading developer events like DevOps Days.
Competition
The market for digital operations management is large, fragmented, and constantly evolving. We primarily replace manual processes, in-house solutions, queued ticketing offerings and software providers that may compete against certain components of our offering. Our primary competitors include Atlassian OpsGenie and Splunk On-Call (formerly VictorOps).
We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including:
•platform functionality and breadth of offering;
•integrations;
•performance, security, scalability, and reliability;
•real-time response, workflow, and automation capabilities;
•focus on modern, contemporary digital services and operations;
•brand recognition, reputation, and customer satisfaction;
•ease of implementation and ease of use, and;
•time-to-value, total cost of ownership, and return on investment.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors and that we are well positioned as a leader in the category of digital operations management.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. While we had 14 issued patents and eight patent 
applications pending examination in the United States as of January 31, 2022 that, with respect to the issued patents, are expected to have terms ending between 2033 and 2040, and we actively seek patent protection covering inventions originating from our company, we do not believe that we are materially dependent on any one or more of our patents. We pursue the registration of domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in various jurisdictions outside the United States.
We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international intellectual property laws. We require our employees, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, and other processes generated by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our vendors and customers.
Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our platform are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
Regulatory
We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, export taxation, or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. Because global laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation. For a discussion of risks related to these various areas of government regulation, see “Risk Factors—We are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly those related to privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business, by resulting in litigation, fines, penalties or adverse publicity and reputational damage that may negatively affect the value of our business and decrease the price of our common stock. Compliance with such laws could also result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our solutions.”
Geographic Information
For a description of our revenue and long-lived assets by geographic location, see Note 14, “Geographic Information” of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Human Capital
Our corporate culture is a critical component of our success and we will continue taking steps to help foster innovation, teamwork, diversity, and inclusion. We promote an environment that values the democratization of ideas and the adoption of a DevOps culture internally, resulting in a mindset that is empowering our team to be more innovative, productive, and collaborative. We are continually investing in our global workforce to further drive diversity and inclusion, provide fair and market-competitive pay and benefits to support our employees’ well-being, and foster their growth and development. As of January 31, 2022, we had 950 employees, of which approximately 71% were in the United States and 29% were in our international locations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity
At PagerDuty, we seek to enable employees of all backgrounds to be champions, facilitators, and practitioners of Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity (“ID&E”) everywhere. Regardless of identity, it is important that all our employees feel welcome, safe, and heard. Our ID&E mission is to activate the potential of all employees through systemic and programmatic equity, sustainable community development, and life-altering learning experiences. Our ID&E vision is a people-first, data-driven organization where power is equitably distributed across the mosaic of our employees’ identities. 
As we work to meet our diversity goals, it is important that every employee feels accepted, supported, and able to be their authentic self. We do this by creating initiatives to invest in equitable and sustainable communities, which help employees mobilize and take action. Our goal is for PagerDuty to be a people-first organization where opportunity is equitably distributed among all employees. Our Employee Resource Groups (“ERG”)—networks of employees with shared characteristics, interests, and experiences—are a critical element in how we achieve this goal and engage with employees. The ERGs are the cultural backbone of our vibrant community and support our ID&E efforts through education, awareness, and celebration.
Additional information on our diversity and inclusion strategy, and diversity metrics and programs can be found on our website at pagerduty.com/careers/diversity/. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.
Compensation, Benefits, and Well Being
We offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being. To ensure alignment with our short- and long-term objectives, our compensation programs include base pay, short-term incentives, and opportunities for long-term incentives. We offer a wide array of benefits including comprehensive health and welfare insurance, generous paid time-off and leave, and retirement support. We provide emotional well-being services through our Employee Assistance Program and a variety of interactive applications.
Currently, the majority of our employees work remotely in order to minimize the spread of COVID-19 among our employee base and comply with local regulations within the United States and internationally. As we continue to monitor the local regulations related to COVID-19, we have begun to release travel restrictions on business-related travel, allowing certain employees to travel on a voluntary basis. We have extended our paid time off and sick leave benefits for employees directly impacted by COVID-19 or caring for children or a member of their household impacted by COVID-19. In addition, we have provided allowances to our employees to cover expenses related to transitioning to a work from home environment. We also continue to offer local employee assistance programs to employees if needed and have implemented scheduled company-wide paid days off to help employees balance their work and life responsibilities.
Employee Engagement and Development
We invest significant resources to develop our in-house talent and deepen our employees’ skill sets, both to strengthen our company and help further our employees’ personal career goals. We empower our employees to drive their career development and set personal development objectives in partnership with their managers. To strengthen these conversations, we train managers to partner with employees through career conversations so that they can successfully leverage the many tools in place to support them.
In order to ensure we are listening to our employees, we regularly survey our employees to obtain their views and assess employee satisfaction. We use the views expressed in the surveys to influence our people strategy and policies. We also use employee survey information to gain insights into how and where we work.
Social Impact and Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Initiatives
We launched PagerDuty.org in 2018 to ensure a sustainable contribution to the communities in which we live, work, and service by integrating social impact and environmental, social and governance goals into our business. PagerDuty.org exists to empower those working to make a difference in the world, and to use our technology to help solve intractable challenges. We do so by mobilizing core company assets to help impact organizations deliver on their mission when every moment matters, by deploying high-impact funding that enables partners to advance justice and equitable health outcomes, and by activating employees to create meaningful impact.
A Pledge 1% member since 2017, we commit 1% of equity, 1% of product, and 1% of employee time to advance positive community impact. In June 2018, we fulfilled our equity pledge by issuing a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock to the Tides Foundation to fund our philanthropic giving. The PagerDuty.org Fund works to meet urgent needs faster to advance justice and health through integrated investments of grants, donated product, and employee expertise in our core areas of Time-Critical Health and Just and Equitable Communities. We deployed approximately $1.9 million in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, including a portfolio of grants (inclusive of Care Message, WeRobotics, Turn.io) to support equitable COVID-19 Vaccine Access and Delivery, a public-private partnership with COVAX/GAVI and the World Health Organization, and new and follow-on funding to help organizations respond to urgent needs faster to advance health (NexLeaf Analytics, Trek Medics, SIRUM). Through our Just and Equity Communities portfolio, we made investments in community-based approaches to vaccine equity and trust, and launched a new grant making program to empower PagerDuty Employee Resource Groups to fund organizations and issues aligned to their community. Through our Impact Pricing program, we provide discounted pricing to nonprofit organizations and social enterprises globally to ensure they can access PagerDuty’s platform for digital operations. Our volunteer time off policy offers employees 20 hours annually to volunteer, vote, and participate in non-partisan voter engagement efforts and peaceful demonstration. Beginning with new hires, our rewards and recognition programs honor and celebrate the contributions employees make in giving their time, expertise, or capital. Ninety-two percent of our employees participated in volunteering or giving back in 2021.
We made early investments in ESG in 2020, including forming a cross-functional ESG Steering Committee of business leadership, to ensure that how we operate as a business produces positive impact. In 2021 we strengthened this work, conducting our first materiality assessment and first two years of greenhouse gas inventories. We garnered a silver rating by EcoVadis, incorporated ESG into the Board charter with Nominating and Corporate Governance oversight, opened a dedicated ESG role, and are preparing our first ESG disclosures. While 
many ESG elements are already in place, we identified areas for further development as we build an integrated cross-company ESG strategy.
To articulate our progress against social impact, equity, and ESG goals and commitments, PagerDuty.org publishes an annual Impact Report. We will track and report annually on our progress against social impact, equity and ESG commitments as we formalize new areas of investment in social impact, inclusion, diversity and equity, and ESG.
