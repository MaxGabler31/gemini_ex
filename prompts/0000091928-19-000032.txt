Item 1. Business
Description of Business
South Jersey Industries, Inc. (SJI or the Company), a New Jersey corporation, was formed in 1969 for the purpose of owning and holding all of the outstanding common stock of South Jersey Gas Company, a public utility, and acquiring and developing non-utility lines of business.

SJI provides a variety of energy-related products and services, primarily through the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:

▪ | SJIU is a holding company that owns SJG, and as of July 1, 2018, ETG and ELK (see "Acquisition" below).


* | SJG is a regulated natural gas utility which distributes natural gas in the seven southernmost counties of New Jersey.


* | ETG is a regulated natural gas utility which distributes natural gas in seven counties in northern and central New Jersey.


* | ELK is a regulated natural gas utility which distributes natural gas in northern Maryland.


• | SJE acquires and markets electricity to retail end users. SJE previously acquired and marketed natural gas and provided total energy management services to commercial, industrial and residential customers. In November 2018, the Company sold SJE's retail gas businesses.


• | SJRG markets natural gas storage, commodity and transportation assets along with fuel management services on a wholesale basis in the mid-Atlantic, Appalachian and southern states.


• | SJEX owns oil, gas and mineral rights in the Marcellus Shale region of Pennsylvania.


• | Marina develops and operates on-site energy-related projects. The significant wholly-owned subsidiaries of Marina include:


• | ACB, which owns and operates a natural gas fueled combined heating, cooling and power facility located in Atlantic City, New Jersey.


• | ACLE, BCLE, SCLE and SXLE, which owns and operates landfill gas-to-energy production facilities in Atlantic, Burlington, Salem and Sussex Counties in New Jersey.


• | MCS, NBS and SBS, which owned and operated solar-generation sites located in New Jersey. These entities were sold in October 2018. 


• | SJESP receives commissions on service contracts from a third party.


• | Midstream invests in infrastructure and other midstream projects, including a current project to build an approximately 118-mile natural gas pipeline in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.


On July 1, 2018, SJI, through its wholly-owned subsidiary SJIU, acquired the assets of ETG and ELK from Pivotal Utility Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of Southern Company Gas (collectively, the "Acquisition"), for total consideration of $1.7 billion. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
On June 27, 2018, the Company, through Marina, entered into a series of agreements whereby Marina agreed to sell its portfolio of solar energy assets to a third-party buyer. As part of these agreements, Marina has agreed to sell its distributed solar energy projects located across New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts and Vermont. As of December 31, 2018, the Company earned cash of $228.1 million related to the closing of these projects, which included selling the wholly-owned subsidiaries MCS, NBS and SBS, along with $62.5 million related to the sale of certain SRECs. The Company currently has projects that have not yet closed and are expected to be sold in 2019. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 
On November 30, 2018, SJI sold the retail gas assets of SJE for total consideration of $15.0 million. As a result of this agreement, SJE no longer acquires, transports or markets natural gas for retail markets.

Transportation and Storage Agreements
During 2018, SJG, ETG and ELK purchased and had delivered natural gas distribution of 49.1 MMdts, 21.8 MMdts and 0.5 MMdts, respectively (ETG and ELK are for the period July 1 - December 31, 2018 only). These deliveries were for on-system and off-system customers and for injections into storage. SJG's average cost per dt of natural gas purchased and delivered in 2018, 2017 and 2016, including demand charges, was $5.20, $3.75 and $3.40, respectively. The average cost per dt of natural gas purchased and delivered for ETG and ELK for the period July 1 - December 31, 2018 was $4.71 and $6.43, respectively.
SJG has direct connections to the interstate pipeline systems of Transco and Columbia. SJG secures other long-term services from Dominion, a pipeline upstream of the Transco and Columbia systems. Services provided by Dominion are utilized to deliver gas into either the Transco or Columbia systems for ultimate delivery to SJG. 
ETG has direct connections to the interstate pipeline systems of Transco, Columbia, Tetco and Tennessee. ETG secures other long-term services from several inter-state pipelines, Dominion, National Fuel and Gulf South that are not directly connected to ETG and are upstream of the Transco and Tetco systems. Services provided by Dominion are utilized to deliver gas into either the Transco or Tetco systems for ultimate delivery to ETG. Services provided by National Fuel and Gulf South are utilized to deliver gas into the Transco system for ultimate delivery to ETG. ETG also secures third-party storage services from Stagecoach Gas Services and Stagecoach Pipeline & Storage Company. 
Total transportation under contract at SJG and ETG are 421,980 dts/d and 218,523 dts/d, respectively. These contracts have terms with various ending dates, ranging from March 31, 2019 through March 31, 2029. The Company's intentions are to renew or extend these service agreements before they expire.
Total storage capacity under contract at SJG and ETG is 8.9 MMdts and 13.1 MMdts, respectively, with a total MDWQ of 170,298 dts and 225,343 dts, respectively.

Gas Supplies
SJG has two separate AMA's with gas marketers that extend through March 31, 2019 and October 31, 2019, respectively. SJG released to the marketers its firm transportation rights, and in return the marketers manage this capacity and provide SJG with firm deliverability each day. The marketer's intents are to optimize the capacity released to SJG under these AMA's and pay SJG an asset management fee.
SJG has two long-term purchase agreements with separate gas producers. SJG has committed to purchase a minimum of 6,250 dts/d and up to 25,000 dts/d of natural gas, from one supplier, for a term of eight years at index-based prices. SJG has also committed to a purchase of a minimum of 55,000 dts/d and up to 70,000 dts/d, from the other supplier for a term of ten years at index-based prices.

South Jersey Industries, Inc.
Part I

On July 1, 2018, ETG and ELK entered into an AMA with SJRG which extends through March 31, 2022. Under this agreement ETG and ELK released to SJRG and/or designated SJRG as agent for all firm transportation and storage contracts. SJRG is obligated to provide natural gas supply to meet demand requirements and optimize ETG’s and ELK's portfolio of natural gas transportation and storage contracts. SJRG pays a fixed fee and shares net margin generated through portfolio optimization.
As part of the gas purchasing strategy, the Utilities use financial contracts to hedge against forward price risk. These contracts are recoverable through the BGSS Clause, subject to BPU/MPSC approval. 
Supplemental Gas Supplies
SJG operates peaking facilities, located in McKee City, NJ, where it liquefies, stores and vaporizes LNG for injection into its distribution system. SJG's LNG facility has a storage capacity equivalent to 434,300 dts of natural gas and has an installed capacity to vaporize up to 118,250 dts of LNG per day for injection into its distribution system.
ETG operates a peaking facility, located in Elizabeth, NJ, where it stores and vaporizes LNG for injection into its distribution system. ETG's LNG facility has a storage capacity equivalent to 145,000 dts of natural gas and has an installed capacity to vaporize up to 25,000 dts of LNG per day for injection into its distribution system.

Peak-Day Supply

SJG plans for a winter season peak-day demand on the basis of an average daily temperature of 2 degrees F or 63 Heating Degree Days, while ETG's plans on an average daily temperature of 0 degrees F or 65 Heating Degree Days. Gas demand on such a design day for the 2018-2019 winter season is estimated to be 566,405 dts for SJG and 445,102 dts for ETG (excluding industrial customers). SJG and ETG project to have adequate supplies and interstate pipeline entitlements to meet design day requirements. SJG and ETG both experienced their highest peak-day demand for calendar year 2018 on January 6th.

Seasonal Aspects

Utility Companies

The Utilities experience seasonal fluctuations in sales when selling natural gas for heating purposes. The Utilities meet these seasonal fluctuations in demand from firm customers by buying and storing gas during the summer months, and by drawing from storage and purchasing supplemental supplies during the heating season. As a result of this seasonality, the Utilities' revenues and net income are significantly higher during the first and fourth quarters than during the second and third quarters of the year.

Non-Utility Companies

Among SJI's non-utility activities, wholesale (including fuel supply management) has seasonal patterns similar to the Utilities. Activities such as energy services and energy project development do not follow seasonal patterns. Other activities, such as retail electric marketing, can have seasonal earnings patterns that are different from the Utilities. The first and fourth quarters remain the periods where most of SJI's revenue and net income is produced.
Working Capital Practices

Reference is made to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” included in Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of this Report.

Customers

No material part of the Company's business is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers, the loss of which would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of SJI on a consolidated basis, or of SJG. 
Backlog

Backlog is not material to an understanding of SJI's business or that of any of its subsidiaries.

Government Contracts

No material portion of the business of SJI or any of its subsidiaries is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of any government.
