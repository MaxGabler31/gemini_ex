ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

A.    Introduction
Churchill Downs Incorporated (the "Company", "we", "us", "our") is an industry-leading racing, gaming and online entertainment company anchored by our iconic flagship event - The Kentucky Derby. We are a leader in brick-and-mortar casino gaming with approximately 10,000 gaming positions in eight states, and we are the largest, legal mobile and online platform for betting on horseracing in the United States. We were organized as a Kentucky corporation in 1928, and our principal executive offices are located in Louisville, Kentucky.
Sale of Big Fish Games, Inc.
On November 29, 2017, the Company entered into a definitive Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) to sell its mobile gaming subsidiary, Big Fish Games, Inc., a Washington corporation (“Big Fish Games”), to Aristocrat Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Purchaser”), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Aristocrat Leisure Limited ("Aristocrat"), an Australian corporation (the “Big Fish Transaction”). On January 9, 2018, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the Big Fish Transaction. The Purchaser paid an aggregate consideration of $990.0 million in cash in connection with the Big Fish Transaction, subject to customary adjustments for working capital and indebtedness and certain other adjustments as set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. As described in further detail in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, the Company has presented Big Fish Games as held for sale and discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.
B.    Business Segments
During 2017, we managed our operations through five continuing operations segments: Racing, Casino, TwinSpires, Other Investments and Corporate. Due to the Big Fish Transaction, our Big Fish Games segment is now included as a discontinued operation. Financial information about these segments is set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this report.  Further discussion of financial results by operating segment is provided in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained within this report.
Racing Segment
Our Racing segment includes our four racetracks: Churchill Downs Racetrack ("Churchill Downs"), Arlington International Race Course ("Arlington"), Fair Grounds Race Course ("Fair Grounds") and Calder Race Course ("Calder"). We conduct live horseracing at Churchill Downs, Arlington and Fair Grounds. On July 1, 2014, we entered into a racing services agreement with The Stronach Group ("TSG") to allow Gulfstream Park to manage and operate Calder through December 31, 2020.
Our racing revenue includes commissions on pari-mutuel wagering at our racetracks and off-track betting facilities ("OTBs") plus simulcast host fees earned from other wagering sites. In addition, ancillary revenue generated by the pari-mutuel facilities includes admissions, sponsorships and licensing rights, and food and beverage sales. Racing revenue and income are influenced by our racing calendar. Racing dates are generally approved annually by the respective state racing authorities. Therefore, racing revenue and operating results for any interim quarter are not generally indicative of the revenue and operating results for the year. The majority of our live racing revenue occurs during the second quarter with the running of the Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs. 
Churchill Downs, Arlington, Fair Grounds, our eleven OTBs in Illinois and twelve OTBs in Louisiana offer year-round simulcast wagering. Gulfstream Park took over operations of Calder’s simulcast wagering beginning July 1, 2014. The OTBs accept wagers on races at the respective racetrack or on races simulcast from other locations.
We generate a significant portion of our pari-mutuel wagering revenue by sending signals of races from our racetracks to other facilities and businesses ("export") and receiving signals from other racetracks ("import"). Revenue is earned through pari-mutuel wagering on signals that we both import and export. 
Churchill Downs
Churchill Downs is located in Louisville, Kentucky and is an internationally known thoroughbred racing operation best known as the home of the iconic Kentucky Derby. We have conducted thoroughbred racing continuously at Churchill Downs since 1875. The Kentucky Derby is the longest continuously held annual sporting event in the United States and is the first race of the annual series of races for 3-year old thoroughbreds known as the Triple Crown. Our history of record attendance, increasing wagering and television viewership is attractive to presenting sponsors and contributed to the eighth consecutive year of earnings growth in 2017. We conducted 70 live race days in 2015, 2016 and 2017, and anticipate having 70 live race days in 2018.

In 2002, as part of the financing of improvements to the Churchill Downs facility, we transferred title of the Churchill Downs facility to the City of Louisville, Kentucky and leased back the facility. Subject to the terms of the lease, we can re-acquire the facility at any time for $1.00.
The facility consists of approximately 147 acres of land with a one-mile dirt track, a seven-eighths (7/8) mile turf track, a grandstand, luxury suites and a stabling area. The facility accommodates seating for approximately 59,000 patrons in our clubhouse, grandstand, Jockey Club Suites, Starting Gate Suites, Finish Line Suites, Turf Club, Grandstand Terrace, Rooftop Garden and Mansion. We have a saddling paddock, accommodations for groups and special events and parking areas for the public. Our racetrack also has permanent lighting in order to accommodate night races. The stable area has barns sufficient to accommodate approximately 1,400 horses and a 114-room dormitory for backstretch personnel. The Churchill Downs facility also includes a simulcast wagering facility. 
We have continued to invest in the facility to enhance the experience of our customers. During the second quarter of 2015, we opened our new winner’s circle suites and a courtyard. The winner’s circle suites include 20 private, open-air suites reserved specifically for Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby horsemen. The courtyard is a spacious lawn area in front of the winner’s circle suites. 
During the second quarter of 2016, we finalized our $19.0 million renovation of the Turf Club and other premium areas. The Turf Club is an exclusive, members-only lounge and dining room located in the clubhouse section of Churchill Downs, directly overlooking the racetrack's finish line.
During the second quarter of 2017, we completed our $16.0 million renovation to modernize 95,000 square feet of the second floor clubhouse. The second floor clubhouse now features more than 220 flat-screen televisions, three new themed bars, 60 wagering windows and 40 self-serve betting machines. 
We have two projects currently underway at Churchill Downs. We expect to complete in the second quarter of 2018 our $37.0 million capital project that will deliver more than 1,800 new seats for the 2018 Kentucky Derby through the addition of 36 new luxury starting gate suites and interior dining tables. In October 2017, we unveiled a $32.0 million project to improve the parking and transportation experience for guests traveling to the Kentucky Derby. The project will feature a significantly enlarged, highly-efficient bus depot and additional transportation infrastructure that will also enhance the overall traffic and parking flow for our guests. Phase 1 is scheduled to be completed prior to the start of the 2018 Spring Meet in April 2018. The second phase will begin after the 144th running of the Kentucky Derby on May 5, 2018 and will be completed prior to the 2018 Breeders' Cup World Championships on November 2-3, 2018. 
We also provide additional stabling and training facilities sufficient to accommodate 500 horses and a three-quarter (3/4) mile dirt track approximately five miles from the racetrack facility. 
Arlington
The Arlington racetrack is located in Arlington Heights, Illinois and is a thoroughbred racing operation with eleven OTBs. The Arlington racetrack hosts a significant stakes race, the Arlington Million. We conducted 77 live race days in 2015, 74 in 2016 and 71 in 2017. We anticipate having 71 live race days in 2018.
The racetrack sits on 336 acres, has a one and one-eighth (1 1/8) mile synthetic track, a one-mile turf track and a five-eighths (5/8) mile training track. The facility includes a clubhouse, grandstand and suite seating for approximately 7,500 persons, and food and beverage facilities. The stable area can accommodate approximately 2,200 horses and has approximately 550 rooms of temporary housing.
Fair Grounds
The Fair Grounds racetrack is located in New Orleans, Louisiana and is a racing operation with twelve OTBs in Louisiana. The Fair Grounds racetrack hosts a significant stakes race, the Louisiana Derby. We conducted 83 thoroughbred live race days in 2015, 78 in 2016 and 83 in 2017. We anticipate having 81 thoroughbred live race days in 2018. We conducted 12 quarter horse live race days in 2015, 10 in 2016 and 10 in 2017. We anticipate having 10 quarter horse live race days in 2018. 
The Fair Grounds facility consists of approximately 145 acres of land, a one-mile dirt track, a seven-eighths (7/8) mile turf track, a grandstand and a stabling area. The facility includes clubhouse and grandstand seating for approximately 5,000 persons, a general admissions area and food and beverage facilities. The stable area consists of barns that can accommodate approximately 1,900 horses and living quarters for approximately 130 people.

Calder is located in Miami Gardens, Florida and is adjacent to Hard Rock Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins. Calder is a thoroughbred racing facility that consists of approximately 170 acres of land with a one-mile dirt track, 7/8-mile turf track, barns and stabling facilities. 
5

We have an agreement with TSG that expires on December 31, 2020 under which we permit TSG to operate and manage Calder’s racetrack and certain other racing and training facilities and to provide live horseracing under Calder’s racing permits. During the term of the agreement, TSG pays Calder a racing services fee and is responsible for the direct and indirect costs of maintaining the racing premises, including the training facilities and applicable barns, and TSG receives the associated revenue from the operation. 
Based on our assessment of potential alternative uses of the Calder property, we razed the barns that were not associated with the TSG agreement and commenced the demolition of the grandstand and certain ancillary facilities. The Company recognized Calder exit costs of $0.8 million in 2017, $2.5 million in 2016, and $13.9 million in 2015 related to demolition costs for the removal of the grandstand. The Calder exit costs recognized in 2015 included a non-cash impairment charge of $12.7 million to reduce the net book value of the grandstand assets to zero.
On November 8, 2016, we completed the sale of 61 acres of excess, undeveloped land at Calder for which we received total proceeds of $25.6 million.

Saratoga Casino Holdings LLC Equity Investment
On October 2, 2015, we completed the acquisition of a 25% equity investment in SCH, which owns Saratoga Casino and Raceway ("Saratoga's New York facility") in Saratoga Springs, New York, for $24.5 million from Saratoga Harness Racing, Inc. ("SHRI"). Saratoga's New York facility has a casino with approximately 1,700 VLT machines, a 1/2-mile harness racetrack with a racing simulcast center, a 117-room hotel, a 3,000 square-foot multi-functional event space and five dining facilities.

On January 3, 2017, we acquired a 50% equity interest in Ocean Enterprise 589 LLC, Ocean Downs LLC and Racing Services LLC (collectively, “Ocean Downs”). SCH owns the remaining 50% of Ocean Downs, and with the Company's 25% interest in SCH, we own an effective 62.5% interest in Ocean Downs. Since both the Company and SCH have participating rights and both must consent to Ocean Downs' operating, investing and financing decisions, the Company accounts for Ocean Downs using the equity method of accounting. 
Ocean Downs, located near Ocean City, Maryland, owns and operates VLTs and table games at the Casino at Ocean Downs and conducts harness racing at Ocean Downs Racetrack. The Casino at Ocean Downs added 100 VLTs and table games in December 2017.

TwinSpires.com is headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky and operates our mobile and online wagering business, which is our platform for betting on horseracing. We are the largest legal mobile and online wagering platform in the U.S. TwinSpires accepts pari-mutuel wagers from customers residing in certain states who establish and fund an account from which they may place wagers via telephone, mobile device (through a browser or the TwinSpires.com mobile app) or through the Internet at www.twinspires.com. Our business is licensed as a multi-jurisdictional simulcasting and interactive wagering hub in the state of Oregon. We offer our customers streaming video of live horse races, as well as replays, and an assortment of racing and handicapping information. In addition, we provide technology services to third parties, and we earn commissions from white label advance deposit wagering products and services. Under these arrangements, we typically provide an advance deposit wagering platform and related operational services while the third party typically provides a brand name, marketing and limited customer functions. We believe that TwinSpires.com is a key component to our growth, and our gaming platform positions us to be a continued market leader in online gaming.

Other
In June 2017, we announced Churchill Downs is investing $60.0 million to construct an 85,000 square-foot, state-of-the-art historical racing machine facility in Louisville, Kentucky called Derby City Gaming, which we expect to open in the second half of 2018. Derby City Gaming will operate under our Churchill Downs pari-mutuel racing license.
In September 2017, we announced a partnership with Keeneland Association, Inc. to propose the construction of two new racing facilities to be located in Corbin, Kentucky and Oak Grove, Kentucky. The proposed facilities will feature live horse racing and historical racing machines. In partnership with Keeneland, we are working closely with the Tourism, Arts and Heritage Cabinet of the Kentucky Department of Tourism and other state and local officials on incentives and necessary infrastructure improvements to bring Corbin and Oak Grove facilities to fruition. The construction of each proposed facility is contingent on receipt of an initial pari-mutuel racing license by the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission. The Company and Keeneland each filed applications with the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission on September 15, 2017.
Corporate Segment
Our Corporate segment includes miscellaneous and other revenue, compensation expense, professional fees and other general and administrative expense not allocated to our other operating segments.

On January 9, 2018, we closed the Big Fish Transaction, at which time Big Fish Games ceased to be an operating segment of the Company.
C.    Competition
Overview
We operate in a highly competitive industry with a large number of participants, some of which have financial and other resources that are greater than ours. The industry faces competition from a variety of sources for discretionary consumer spending, including spectator sports, fantasy sports and other entertainment and gaming options. Internet-based interactive gaming and wagering, both legal and illegal, is growing rapidly and we anticipate competition in this area will become more intense as new Internet-based ventures enter the industry and as state and federal regulations on Internet-based activities are clarified. Additionally, our brick-and-mortar casinos compete with traditional and Native American casinos, video lottery terminals, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.
Legalized gambling is currently permitted in various forms in many states and Canada. Other jurisdictions could legalize gambling in the future, and established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion of existing gaming operations. If additional gaming opportunities become available near our racing or gaming operations, such gaming operations could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Racing
In 2017, approximately 37,000 thoroughbred horse races were conducted in the United States. Of these races, we hosted approximately 2,200 races, or 5.9% of the total. As a content provider, we compete for wagering dollars in the simulcast market with other racetracks conducting races at or near the same times as our races. As a racetrack operator, we also compete for horses with other racetracks running live racing meets at or near the same time as our races. Our ability to compete is substantially dependent on the racing calendar, number of horses racing and purse sizes. In recent years, competition has increased as more states legalize gaming and allow slot machines at racetracks with mandatory purse contributions. Over 89 percent of pari-mutuel handle is bet at off-track locations, either at other racetracks, OTBs, casinos, or through mobile and online wagering channels. As 
8

a content distributor, we compete for these dollars to be wagered at our racetracks, OTBs, casinos and via our mobile and online wagering business.
Churchill Downs
Churchill Downs faces competition from freestanding casinos and racetracks that are combined with casinos ("racinos") in Indiana, West Virginia and Ohio. In Indiana, these casinos include Horseshoe Indiana, in Elizabeth, Indiana; Belterra Casino in Florence, Indiana and French Lick Resort in French Lick, Indiana. In Indiana, there are two racinos: Hoosier Park which operates 2,000 slot machines, and Indiana Grand Racing & Casino, which operates 2,200 slot machines. In West Virginia, there are two racinos: Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races and Mountaineer Casino Racetrack and Resort. In Ohio, seven racetracks offer VLT facilities. 
In New York, Aqueduct Racetrack has a gaming facility with more than 6,000 VLTs and electronic table games. As a result of the addition of gaming activities, New York purse payments at each of the three largest New York racetracks, Aqueduct Racetrack, Belmont Park and Saratoga Racetrack, were greatly enhanced compared to historical levels. 
These developments may result in Indiana, Ohio and New York racetracks attracting horses that would otherwise race at Kentucky racetracks, including Churchill Downs, thus negatively affecting the number of starters that, in turn, may have a negative effect on handle. 
Arlington 
Arlington competes in the Chicago market against a variety of entertainment options. In addition to other racetracks in the area such as Hawthorne Race Course, there are ten riverboat casino operations that attract the Chicago market, including Rivers Casino, in Des Plaines, Illinois. Additionally, Native American gaming operations in Wisconsin may also adversely affect Arlington.
The Video Gaming Act was enacted in July 2009, authorizing the placement of up to five video gaming terminals ("VGTs") in licensed retail establishments, truck stops, and veteran and fraternal establishments. There are currently over 28,000 VGTs distributed among more than 6,000 establishments throughout Illinois.
Fair Grounds
Fair Grounds competes in Louisiana in both thoroughbred and quarter horse racing with Louisiana Downs, Evangeline Downs, Harrah's Louisiana Downs and Delta Downs as well as with other southern state racetracks, including Gulfstream Park in Florida and Oaklawn Park in Arkansas.
Casinos
Oxford
Oxford competes with Hollywood Casino in Bangor, Maine. Oxford also competes with Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville, Massachusetts, which opened in June 2015. MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts is scheduled to open in September 2018 and Wynn Boston Harbor also in Boston, Massachusetts is expected to open in 2019.
Riverwalk
Riverwalk competes in the Vicksburg, Mississippi area and is one of five casinos in the local market. Our principal local competitors are Ameristar Casino, Lady Luck Casino, DiamondJacks and WaterView Casino & Hotel. In addition, Riverwalk faces regional competition from Magnolia Bluff Casino and the Pearl River Resort in Mississippi.
Harlow’s
Harlow’s competes in Greenville, Mississippi with a variety of regional riverboat and land-based casinos. Our primary local competitor is Trop Casino, which reopened its renovated property during October 2014. Harlow’s also faces regional competition from a casino in Lula, Mississippi, eight casinos in Tunica, Mississippi and two casinos in Arkansas.
The Mississippi Gaming Control Act does not limit the number of licenses that may be granted.
Calder Casino
Calder Casino competes with seven pari-mutuel casinos as well as four Native American-owned casinos, all of which are located in Miami-Dade or Broward County, Florida. We also face competition from a large number of cruise ship operators in Miami and Ft. Lauderdale. Native American casinos offer a variety of table games and are taxed at lower rates and, therefore, are generally able to spend more money marketing their facilities to consumers.
Fair Grounds Slots and Video Services, LLC
Fair Grounds Slots competes in the New Orleans, Louisiana area with two riverboat casinos and Harrah’s, which is the largest, closest and only land-based casino competitor to Fair Grounds Slots. Fair Grounds Slots faces significant gambling competition 
9

along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Fair Grounds Slots and VSI also compete with video poker operations located at various OTBs, truck stops and restaurants in the area. In 2015, Fair Grounds Slots was adversely impacted by a smoking ban in Orleans Parish which increased competition from properties outside of Orleans Parish.
MVG
MVG competes with Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway, a VLT facility in Dayton, Ohio and JACK Cincinnati, a slot machine and table games casino in Cincinnati, Ohio. MVG also faces regional competition from three casinos in Indiana and two other gaming properties in Columbus, Ohio.
Saratoga 
Saratoga's New York facility competes with Rivers Casino, a new casino in Schenectady, New York, which opened in February 2017. Saratoga's Colorado facility competes in Black Hawk, Colorado with a variety of casinos including Ameristar Casino, Isle of Capri Hotel & Casino and The Lodge & Hotel at Black Hawk, all of which offer hotel accommodations, slot machines and poker and other table games.
Ocean Downs
Ocean Downs competes with Harrington Raceway & Casino, in Harrington, Delaware, which has slot machines, table games, simulcasting and live racing. Ocean Downs also faces competition from Dover Downs Hotel and Casino, in Dover, Delaware, which offers slot machines, table games, hotel accommodations and a spa facility.
TwinSpires
TwinSpires.com competes with other mobile and online wagering businesses for both customers and racing content, and it also competes with online gaming sites. Our competitors include Betfair Limited (d/b/a TVG), The Stronach Group (d/b/a XpressBet), Premier Turf Club, AmWest Entertainment, The New York Racing Association (d/b/a NYRA Rewards), Connecticut OTB, Penn National Gaming Inc. and Racing2Day LLC.
Our BRIS business competes with companies such as Equibase and the Daily Racing Form.
Other Investments
In North America, United Tote competes primarily with Sportech and AmTote International, Inc. Our competition outside of North America is very fragmented.
D.    Governmental Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect our businesses. The ownership, operation and management of our racing operations, our casino operations, TwinSpires and Big Fish Games are subject to regulation under the laws and regulations of each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The ownership, operation and management of our segments are also subject to legislative actions at both the federal and state level. 
Federal Regulations
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") was signed into law. The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of 2017, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The Tax Act also enhanced and extended through 2026 the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualified property. We believe the Tax Act will have a positive impact on our business. 
In September 2017, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") announced modernized regulations regarding withholding and reporting of pari-mutuel proceeds. Specifically, under the new regulations, when determining an amount to be reported or withheld for taxes, the IRS will consider a bettor’s entire investment in a single pari-mutuel pool instead of only the amount wagered on a winning result. We have implemented the regulations and believe the new regulations will have a positive impact on our business.
Racing Regulations
Horseracing is a highly regulated industry. In the U.S., individual states control the operations of racetracks located within their respective jurisdictions with the intent of, among other things, protecting the public from unfair and illegal gambling practices, generating tax revenue, licensing racetracks and operators and preventing organized crime from being involved in the industry. Although the specific form may vary, states that regulate horseracing generally do so through a horseracing commission or other gambling regulatory authority. In general, regulatory authorities perform background checks on all racetrack owners prior to granting them the necessary operating licenses. Horse owners, trainers, jockeys, drivers, stewards, judges and backstretch personnel are also subject to licensing by governmental authorities. State regulation of horse races extends to virtually every aspect of racing 
10

and usually extends to details such as the presence and placement of specific race officials, including timers, placing judges, starters and patrol judges. We currently satisfy the applicable licensing requirements of the racing and gambling regulatory authorities in each state where we maintain racetracks or pari-mutuel operations and/or businesses.
The total number of days on which each racetrack conducts live thoroughbred racing fluctuates annually according to each calendar year and the determination of applicable regulatory authorities.
In the United States, interstate pari-mutuel wagering on horseracing is subject to the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 ("IHA"), as amended in 2000. Through the IHA, racetracks can commingle wagers from different racetracks and wagering facilities and broadcast horseracing events to other licensed establishments.
Kentucky
Horseracing tracks in Kentucky are subject to the licensing and regulation of the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission ("KHRC"). The KHRC is responsible for overseeing horseracing and regulating the state equine industry. Licenses to conduct live thoroughbred racing meets, to participate in simulcasting and to accept advance deposit wagers from Kentucky residents are approved annually by the KHRC based upon applications submitted by the racetracks in Kentucky. To some extent, Churchill Downs competes with other racetracks in Kentucky for the award of racing dates; however, the KHRC is required by state law to consider and seek to preserve each racetrack’s usual and customary live racing dates.
Illinois
In Illinois, licenses to conduct live thoroughbred racing and to participate in simulcast wagering are approved by the Illinois Racing Board ("IRB"). In September 2017, the IRB appointed Arlington the dark host track in Illinois for 60 simulcast host days during 2018, a decrease of 1 day compared to 2017.  In addition, Arlington was awarded 155 live host days for 2018, an increase of 1 day as compared to 2017.  In total, Arlington was awarded 215 live and dark host days in 2018, which is the same as compared to 2017.
On May 26, 2016, the Illinois legislature passed a bill to reauthorize advance deposit wagering though December 31, 2018 and continued incremental surcharges on winning wagers. 
Florida
In Florida, licenses to conduct live thoroughbred racing and to participate in simulcast wagering are approved by the Department of Business and Professional Regulation's Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering ("DPW"). The DPW is responsible for overseeing the network of state offices located at every pari-mutuel wagering facility, as well as issuing the permits necessary to operate a pari-mutuel wagering facility. The DPW also issues annual licenses for thoroughbred, standardbred and quarter horse races but does not approve the specific live race days.
Louisiana
In Louisiana, licenses to conduct live thoroughbred racing and to participate in simulcast wagering are approved by the Louisiana State Racing Commission ("LSRC"). The LSRC is responsible for overseeing the awarding of licenses for the conduct of live racing meets, the conduct of thoroughbred horseracing, the types of wagering that may be offered by pari-mutuel facilities and the disposition of revenue generated from wagering. Off-track wagering is also regulated by the LSRC. Louisiana law requires live racing at a licensed racetrack for at least 80 days over a 20 week period each year to maintain the license and to conduct slot operations.
With the addition of slot machines at Fair Grounds, Louisiana law requires live quarter horseracing to be conducted at the racetrack. We conducted quarter horseracing at Fair Grounds for 10 days in 2015, 10 days in 2016 and 10 days in 2017. We expect to conduct quarter horseracing for 10 days in 2018.
In March 2016, during a special session held to address Louisiana’s budget deficit, legislation was passed which temporarily removed the sales tax exemption Fair Grounds qualified for as a pari-mutuel. From April 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, Fair Grounds paid the statutory state tax of 4% on all purchases related to racing operations. Effective July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2018, Fair Grounds is required to pay a 2% state tax on purchases related to racing operations. During the same special session, the Louisiana Legislature also added another one percent to the state tax base until July 1, 2018. The sales tax exemption is scheduled to be reinstated July 1, 2018.  The legislation is expected to have an adverse impact on our business.
Casino Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
Casino laws are generally designed to protect casino consumers and the viability and integrity of the casino industry. Casino laws may also be designed to protect and maximize state and local revenue derived through taxes and licensing fees imposed on casino industry participants as well as to enhance economic development and tourism. To accomplish these public policy goals, casino laws establish procedures to ensure that participants in the casino industry meet certain standards of character and fitness. In addition, casino laws require casino industry participants to:
11


• | Ensure that unsuitable individuals and organizations have no role in casino operations;


• | Establish procedures designed to prevent cheating and fraudulent practices;


• | Establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures;


• | Maintain effective controls over financial practices, including establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenue;


• | Maintain systems for reliable record keeping;


• | File periodic reports with casino regulators;


• | Ensure that contracts and financial transactions are commercially reasonable, reflect fair market value and are arms-length transactions;


• | Establish programs to promote responsible gambling and inform patrons of the availability of help for problem gambling; and


• | Enforce minimum age requirements.

Typically, a state regulatory environment is established by statute and administered by a regulatory agency with broad discretion to regulate the affairs of owners, managers and persons with financial interests in casino operations. Among other things, casino authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate:

• | Adopt rules and regulations under the implementing statutes;


• | Interpret and enforce casino laws;


• | Impose disciplinary sanctions for violations, including fines and penalties;


• | Review the character and fitness of participants in casino operations and make determinations regarding suitability or qualification for licensure;


• | Grant licenses for participation in casino operations;


• | Collect and review reports and information submitted by participants in casino operations;


• | Review and approve transactions, such as acquisitions or change-of-control transactions of casino industry participants, securities offerings and debt transactions engaged in by such participants; and


• | Establish and collect fees and taxes.

Any change in the laws or regulations of a casino jurisdiction could have a material adverse impact on our casino operations.
Licensing and Suitability Determinations
Gaming laws require us, each of our subsidiaries engaged in casino operations, certain of our directors, officers and employees, and in some cases, certain of our shareholders, to obtain licenses from casino authorities. Licenses typically require a determination that the applicant qualifies or is suitable to hold the license. Gaming authorities have very broad discretion in determining whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be deemed suitable. Criteria used in determining whether to grant a license to conduct casino operations, while varying between jurisdictions, generally include consideration of factors such as the good character, honesty and integrity of the applicant; the financial stability, integrity and responsibility of the applicant, including whether the operation is adequately capitalized in the state and exhibits the ability to maintain adequate insurance levels; the quality of the applicant’s casino facilities; the amount of revenue to be derived by the applicable state from the operation of the applicant’s casino; the applicant’s practices with respect to minority hiring and training; and the effect on competition and general impact on the community.
In evaluating individual applicants, casino authorities consider the individual’s business experience and reputation for good character, the individual’s criminal history and the character of those with whom the individual associates.
Many casino jurisdictions limit the number of licenses granted to operate casinos within the state and some states limit the number of licenses granted to any one casino operator. Licenses under casino laws are generally not transferable without approval. Licenses in most of the jurisdictions in which we conduct casino operations are granted for limited durations and require renewal from time to time. There can be no assurance that any of our licenses will be renewed. The failure to renew any of our licenses could have a material adverse impact on our casino operations.
In addition to our subsidiaries engaged in casino operations, casino authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to or material involvement with, any of these entities to determine whether such individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a casino licensee. Our officers, directors and certain key employees must file applications with 
12

the casino authorities and may be required to be licensed, qualify or be found suitable in many jurisdictions. Gaming authorities may deny an application for licensing for any cause that they deem reasonable. Qualification and suitability determinations require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. The applicant must pay all the costs of the investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to casino authorities. In addition to casino authorities' ability to deny a license, qualification or finding of suitability, casino authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.
If one or more casino authorities were to find that an officer, director or key employee fails to qualify or is unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would be required to sever all relationships with such person. In addition, casino authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.
Moreover, in many jurisdictions, certain of our shareholders may be required to undergo a suitability investigation similar to that described above. Many jurisdictions require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of our voting securities, typically 5%, to report the acquisition to casino authorities, and casino authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification or a finding of suitability. Most casino authorities, however, allow an "institutional investor" to apply for a waiver. An "institutional investor" is generally defined as an investor acquiring and holding voting securities in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor, and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a member of our board of directors, any change in our corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations, or those of any of our casino affiliates, or the taking of any other action which casino authorities find to be inconsistent with holding our voting securities for investment purposes only. Even if a waiver is granted, an institutional investor generally may not take any action inconsistent with its status when the waiver was granted without once again becoming subject to the foregoing reporting and application obligations.
Generally, any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within the prescribed period after being advised it is required by casino authorities may be denied a license or found unsuitable, as applicable. Any shareholder found unsuitable or denied a license and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of our voting securities beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by the applicable casino authorities may be guilty of a criminal offense. Furthermore, we may be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a shareholder or to have any other relationship with us or any of our subsidiaries, we: (i) pay that person any dividend or interest upon our voting securities; (ii) allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person; (iii) pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or (iv) fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish voting securities including, if necessary, the immediate purchase of said voting securities for cash at fair market value.
Violations of Gaming Laws
If we violate applicable casino laws, our casino licenses could be limited, conditioned, suspended or revoked by casino authorities, and we and any other persons involved could be subject to substantial fines. A supervisor or conservator can be appointed by casino authorities to operate our casino properties, or in some jurisdictions, take title to our casino assets in the jurisdiction, and under certain circumstances, income generated during such appointment could be forfeited to the applicable state or states. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. As a result, violations by us of applicable casino laws could have a material adverse impact on our casino operations.
Some casino jurisdictions prohibit certain types of political activity by a casino licensee, its officers, directors and key employees. A violation of such a prohibition may subject the offender to criminal and/or disciplinary action.
Reporting and Record-keeping Requirements
We are required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports and furnish any other information that casino authorities may require. Under federal law, we are required to record and submit detailed reports of currency transactions involving greater than $10,000 at our casinos and racetracks as well as any suspicious activity that may occur at such facilities. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines or cessation of operations. We are required to maintain a current stock ledger that may be examined by casino authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to casino authorities. A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. Gaming authorities may require certificates for our securities to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to specified casino laws.
Review and Approval of Transactions
Substantially all material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions must be reported to and in some cases approved by casino authorities. We may not make a public offering of securities without the prior approval of certain casino authorities. Changes in control through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or otherwise are subject to receipt of prior approval of casino authorities. Entities seeking to acquire control of us or one of our 
13

subsidiaries must satisfy casino authorities with respect to a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control. Gaming authorities may also require controlling shareholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control, to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.
License Fees and Gaming Taxes
We pay substantial license fees and taxes in many jurisdictions in connection with our casino operations which are computed in various ways depending on the type of gambling or activity involved. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable with varying frequency. License fees and taxes are based upon such factors as a percentage of the gross casino revenue received; the number of gambling devices and table games operated; or a one-time fee payable upon the initial receipt of license and fees in connection with the renewal of license. In some jurisdictions, casino tax rates are graduated such that the tax rates increase as gross casino revenue increases. Tax rates are subject to change, sometimes with little notice, and such changes could have a material adverse impact on our casino operations.
Operational Requirements
In most jurisdictions, we are subject to certain requirements and restrictions on how we must conduct our casino operations. In certain states, we are required to give preference to local suppliers and include minority and women-owned businesses and organized labor in construction projects to the maximum extent practicable. We may be required to give employment preference to minorities, women and in-state residents in certain jurisdictions. Our ability to conduct certain types of games, introduce new games or move existing games within our facilities may be restricted or subject to regulatory review and approval. Some of our operations are subject to restrictions on the number of gaming positions we may have and the maximum wagers allowed to be placed by our customers.
Specific State Casino Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
Florida
The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the State of Florida is subject to extensive state and local regulation, primarily by the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (the "DBPR"), within the executive branch of Florida’s state government. The DBPR is charged with the regulation of Florida’s pari-mutuel, card room and slot gaming industries, as well as collecting and safeguarding associated revenue due to the state. The DBPR has been designated by the Florida legislature as the state compliance agency with the authority to carry out the state’s oversight responsibilities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the compact between the Seminole Tribe of Florida and the State of Florida. Changes in Florida laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our Florida gaming operation. The laws and regulations of Florida are based on policies of maintaining the health, welfare and safety of the general public and protecting the video gaming industry from elements of organized crime, illegal gambling activities and other harmful elements, as well as protecting the public from illegal and unscrupulous gaming to ensure the fair play of devices. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the DBPR could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Potential Seminole Compact and Potential Decoupling in Florida
In December 2015, Florida’s Governor signed a twenty-year Seminole Compact with the Seminole Tribe preserving the Seminole Tribe's geographic exclusivity and right to exclusively operate blackjack, craps and roulette games and providing the state with an expected $3.0 billion in additional state revenue over a seven-year period beginning in 2017. The Seminole Compact addresses other issues such as the potential for pari-mutuel operations to add blackjack in a limited fashion as well as the potential for expanded licenses in Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties. 
In November 2017, legislation was filed that would allow pari-mutuel facilities in Miami-Dade and Broward counties to decouple their pari-mutuel and gaming operations. If a pari-mutuel facility elects to decouple, the pari-mutuel facility must pay an amount equal to the lesser of $2.0 million or three percent of its slot machine revenues. A pari-mutuel facility may offset these payments, if prior to the effective date of the legislation, the pari-mutuel facility is making purse and award supplement payments in accordance with existing statutory requirements. The bill provides for a five percent tax reduction on slot machine revenues in 2019 and another five percent reduction in 2020, but if in any year going forward the aggregate amount of tax paid to the state by slot machine licensees is less than the amount paid in fiscal year 2017-2018, the licensee that paid less in that year than it did in 2017-2018 must pay a surcharge equal to the amount of taxes paid by the licensee in 2017-2018. The legislation also makes it clear that designated player games are not a banked game and establishes rules around the operation of such games. The issue is still pending before the legislature. 
At this time it is not possible to determine what impact legislation with respect to authorizing the Seminole Compact or decoupling would have on our business.

Louisiana
The manufacture, distribution, servicing and operation of video draw poker devices in Louisiana are subject to the Louisiana Video Draw Poker Devices Control Law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The manufacture, distribution, servicing and operation of video poker devices and slot machines are governed by the Louisiana Gaming Control Board (the "Louisiana Board") which oversees all licensing for all forms of legalized gaming in Louisiana. The Video Gaming Division and the Slots Gaming Division of the Gaming Enforcement Section of the Office of the State Police within the Department of Public Safety and Corrections (the "Division") performs the video poker and slots gaming investigative functions for the Louisiana Board. The laws and regulations of Louisiana are based on policies of maintaining the health, welfare and safety of the general public and protecting the video gaming industry from elements of organized crime, illegal gambling activities and other harmful elements, as well as protecting the public from illegal and unscrupulous gaming to ensure the fair play of devices. The Louisiana Board also regulates slot machine gaming at racetrack facilities pursuant to the Louisiana Pari-Mutuel Live Racing Facility Economic Redevelopment and Gaming Control Act. Changes in Louisiana laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our Louisiana gaming operations. In addition, the LSRC also issues licenses required for Fair Grounds to operate slot machines at the racetrack and video poker devices at its OTBs. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the Louisiana Board or the LSRC could have a material adverse impact on our business.
On January 22, 2015, the New Orleans City Council approved a smoking ban in bars and other public places, including casinos, in Orleans Parish which took effect on April 22, 2015. The smoking ban had a negative impact on Fair Grounds Slots which was partially offset by VSI, whose OTB locations are located outside of Orleans Parish.
Maine
The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the State of Maine is subject to extensive state and local regulation and is subject to licensing and regulatory control by the Maine Gambling Control Board (the "MGCB"). The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the MGCB are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with, among other things: (1) the regulation, supervision and general control over casinos and the ownership and operation of slot machines and table games; (2) the investigation of complaints made regarding casinos; (3) the establishment and maintenance of responsible accounting practices and procedures; (4) the maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenue and providing for reliable record keeping; and (5) the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices. The regulations are subject to amendment and interpretation by the MGCB. Changes in Maine laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our Maine gaming operations. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the MGCB could have a material adverse impact on our business.
In November 2017, a citizen’s initiative was defeated, which would have permitted the construction of a casino in York County. 
Maryland
In April 2017, Maryland's Governor signed a law allowing casinos in Allegany and Worcester counties to qualify for a 10% gaming tax reduction on slot machine revenue effective July 1, 2017. In order to qualify for the gaming tax reduction, casinos must purchase or acquire the right to lease all of their VLTs prior to January 1, 2019. As of August 1, 2017, we purchased or acquired the right to lease all of our VLTs and have realized an effective 10% gaming tax reduction from August 1, 2017 forward under this new law.
Under pre-April 2017 Maryland law, Ocean Downs would be required to spend $1.5 million on racing-related capital maintenance and expenditures in order to qualify for a matching grant from the state. In April 2017, legislation was signed into law to lower the required spend on racing-related capital maintenance and expenditures to qualify for matching state funds to $0.3 million. This legislation has had and we believe will continue to have a positive impact on our business.
Also in April 2017, legislation was signed into law to allow a VLT licensee to reduce the following day's proceeds by the amount of money returned to players that exceeds the amount bet through VLTs or table games on a given day, thereby reducing the taxes owed by the VLT licensee. This legislation has had and we believe will continue to have a positive impact on our business.
Mississippi
The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the State of Mississippi is subject to extensive state and local regulation, including the Mississippi Gaming Commission (the "Mississippi Commission"). The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Mississippi Commission are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with, among other things: (1) the prevention of unsavory or unsuitable persons from having direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; (2) the establishment and maintenance of responsible accounting practices and procedures; (3) the maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenue, providing for reliable record keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the 
15

Mississippi Commission; (4) the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices; (5) providing a source of state and local revenue through taxation and licensing fees; and (6) ensuring that gaming licensees, to the extent practicable, employ Mississippi residents. The regulations are subject to amendment and interpretation by the Mississippi Commission. Changes in Mississippi laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our Mississippi gaming operations. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the Mississippi Commission could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Ohio
Video Lottery was introduced in the State of Ohio in 2012 when the Governor of Ohio signed Executive Order 2011-22K, which authorized the Ohio Lottery Commission (the "OLC") to amend and adopt rules necessary to implement a video lottery program at Ohio’s seven horse racing facilities. The ownership and operation of VLT facilities in the State of Ohio is subject to extensive state and local regulation. The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the OLC include: 1) regulating the licensing of video lottery sales agents, key gaming employees and VLT manufacturers; 2) collecting and disbursing VLT revenue; and 3) maintaining compliance in regulatory matters. Changes in Ohio laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our Ohio gaming operations. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the OLC could have a material adverse impact on our business.
New York
The ownership and operation of VLT facilities in New York are governed by the New York State Gaming Commission ("NYSGC") under the New York State Lottery for Education Law. The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the NYSGC include: 1) regulating the licensing of video lottery gaming agents, principal key gaming employees and VLT manufacturers; 2) collecting and disbursing VLT revenue; and 3) maintaining compliance in regulatory matters. Changes in New York laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our New York gaming operations. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the NYSGC could have a material impact on our business.
During 2012, the Governor of New York and legislative leaders agreed to legalize casino gaming and seek an amendment to the state constitution that would authorize such gaming and, during 2013, New York voters approved a constitutional amendment authorizing up to seven casinos in the state. As of December 31, 2017, New York had awarded four of the seven casino licenses. After a 7-year exclusivity period, the state may award additional licenses. An expansion of gaming in New York includes incentives for the horse racing industry. At this time, it is not possible to determine the impact casino gaming could have on our business.
Potential New York Racino Legislation
In January 2018, New York's Governor released his proposed 2018-2019 budget, which included the removal of the statutory hold-harmless provision for tax parity between newly opened casinos and previously existing racinos. The issue is pending before the legislature. If this legislation is approved, we believe it would increase our taxes and have a negative impact on our business. 
Potential New York Interactive Gaming Legislation
In June 2017, the New York legislature passed a bill that will allow Saratoga Casino Hotel to be eligible to use up to 4% of net winnings for capital improvement projects at the facility. The money must be used solely for capital projects that will improve the facility and attract customers. The capital projects must be approved by the lottery and the gaming commission. The bill was signed by the Governor and we believe it will have a positive material impact on our business.
Specific State TwinSpires Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
TwinSpires is licensed in Oregon under a multi-jurisdictional simulcasting and interactive wagering totalisator hub license issued by the Oregon Racing Commission ("ORC") and in accordance with Oregon law. TwinSpires also holds advance deposit wagering licenses in certain other states where required such as California, Illinois, Idaho, Kentucky, Maryland, Virginia, Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming, Arkansas, New York and Washington. Changes in the form of new legislation or regulatory activity at the state or federal level could adversely impact our mobile and online business.
Pennsylvania
On October 30, 2017, the Governor signed legislation (House Bill 271) that will expand gaming in the state, including authorizing interactive gaming. Under the terms of the legislation, Category 1, 2 and 3 casino licensees qualify for an interactive gaming license. Three categories of interactive gaming licenses are available: poker, slot and table games. Each casino licensee has the opportunity to receive any or all of the three categories of licenses for an initial period of five years. If a casino licensee applies for an interactive gaming license within the first ninety days, the casino must apply for all three categories of licenses for a total fee of $10.0 million. If a casino applies during the ninety to one hundred and twenty day time period, the casino may apply for 
16

one or more categories of licenses for a fee of $4.0 million each. If, at the end of the one hundred and twenty day period, there are remaining interactive gaming licenses, a qualified gaming entity licensed in any jurisdiction may apply for one or more of the available licenses. A tax rate of 52% of gross interactive gaming revenue (“GIGR”) on slots and 14% of GIGR on poker and table games was established. There is an additional 2% tax of daily GIGR for local revenue share payments.
The legislation also removed previous statutory language which provided each Pennsylvania racetrack a local monopoly over all telephone or Internet wagers on horse racing from Pennsylvania residents located within a 35 mile radius of such racetrack. The legislation also lowered the initial license fee for advance depositing wagering operators from $500,000 to $50,000 and lowered the annual ongoing license fee from $100,000 to $10,000.
We believe this legislation may have a positive impact on business operations.
E.    Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, as well as the management and disposal of solid, animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials. These laws and regulations, which are complex and subject to change, include United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and state laws and regulations that address the impacts of manure and wastewater generated by Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations ("CAFO") on water quality, including, but not limited to, storm and sanitary water discharges. CAFO and other water discharge regulations include permit requirements and water quality discharge standards. Enforcement of these regulations has been receiving increased governmental attention. Compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures. We may incur future costs under existing and new laws and regulations pertaining to storm water and wastewater management at our racetracks. Moreover, violations can result in significant penalties and, in some instances, interruption or cessation of operations.
In the ordinary course of our business, we may receive notices from regulatory agencies regarding our compliance with CAFO regulations that may require remediation at our facilities. On December 6, 2013, we received a notice from the EPA regarding alleged CAFO non-compliance at Fair Grounds. We are currently in discussions with the EPA regarding potential remedial actions relating to alleged CAFO non-compliance at Fair Grounds and expect to incur certain capital expenditures to upgrade these facilities to resolve this issue.
We also are subject to laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating hazardous substances or petroleum products on its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants, and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time they occurred. The presence of, or failure to remediate properly, such substances may materially adversely affect the ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow funds using such property as collateral. Additionally, the owner of a property may be subject to claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property.
F.    Marks and Internet Properties
We hold numerous state and federal service mark registrations on specific names and designs in various categories including the entertainment business, apparel, paper goods, printed matter, housewares and glass. We license the use of these service marks and derive revenue from such license agreements.
G.    Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 4,300 full-time and part-time employees Company-wide. Due to the seasonal nature of our live racing business, the number of seasonal and part-time persons employed will vary throughout the year.
H.    Available Information
Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filings, and any amendments to those reports and any other filings that we file with or furnish to the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are made available free of charge on our website (www.churchilldownsincorporated.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the materials with the SEC and are also available at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. These reports may also be obtained from the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549 or by calling the SEC at (800) SEC-0330.
