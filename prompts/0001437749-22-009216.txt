Item 1. BUSINESS
 
Perma-Pipe International Holdings, Inc., collectively with its subsidiaries ("PPIH", the "Company" or the "Registrant"), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of products in one reportable segment: Piping Systems. The Company was incorporated in Delaware on October 12, 1993. The Company's common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market and reported under the ticker symbol "PPIH". The Company's fiscal year ends on January 31. Years, results and balances described as 2022, 2021 and 2020 are for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 
Products and services. The Company engineers, designs, manufactures and sells specialty piping systems and leak detection systems. Specialty piping systems include: (i) insulated and jacketed district heating and cooling piping systems for efficient energy distribution from central energy plants to multiple locations, (ii) primary and secondary containment piping systems for transporting chemicals, hazardous fluids and petroleum products, (iii) the coating and/or insulation of oil and gas gathering and transmission pipelines, and (iv) liquid and powder based anti-corrosion coatings applied both to the external and internal surfaces of steel pipe, including shapes like bends, reducers, tees, and other spools/fittings used in pipelines for the transportation of oil and gas products and potable water. The Company's leak detection systems are sold with its piping systems or on a stand-alone basis to monitor areas where fluid intrusion may contaminate the environment, endanger personal safety, cause a fire hazard, impair essential services or damage equipment or property.
 
The Company frequently engineers and custom fabricates to job site dimensions and incorporates provisions for thermal expansion due to cycling temperatures. Most of the Company's piping systems are produced for underground installations and, therefore, require trenching, which is the responsibility of the general contractor, and completed by unaffiliated installation contractors.
 
The Company’s piping systems are typically sold as a part of discrete projects, and customer demand can vary by reporting period. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
 
Operating Facilities: The Company operates its business from the following locations:

Customers and sales channels. The Company's customer base is industrially and geographically diverse. In the United States, the Company employs inside and outside sales managers who use and assist a network of independent manufacturers' representatives, none of whom sell products that are competitive with the Company's piping systems. The Company employs a direct sales force to market and sell products and services in Canada, India, Egypt, and in several countries in the Middle East. On a country-by-country basis, and where advantageous, the Company uses an agent network to assist in marketing and selling the Company's products and services.
 
For the years ended January 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, no one customer accounted for greater than 10% of the Company's consolidated net sales.
 
As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, one customer accounted for 11.9% and no one customer accounted for greater than 10% of accounts receivable, respectively.
 
Backlog. The Company’s backlog on January 31, 2022 was $39.3 million compared to $52.6 million on January 31, 2021, most of which is expected to be completed within 2022. This decrease was primarily the result of the Company's completion of a significant number of projects during 2021 that were delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic and related disruptions. The Company defines backlog as the expected total revenue value resulting from confirmed customer purchase orders that have not yet been recognized as revenue. However, by industry practice, orders may be canceled or modified at any time. If a customer cancels an order, the customer is normally responsible for all finished goods produced or shipped, all direct and indirect costs incurred, and also for a reasonable allowance for anticipated profits. No assurance can be given that these amounts will be recovered after cancellation. Any cancellation or delay in orders may result in lower than expected revenue from the Company's reported backlog.
 
Intellectual property. The Company owns various patents covering its piping and electronic leak detection systems, as well as for some of the features of its sensor cables. These patents are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate because the Company believes its sales would not be materially reduced if patent protection was not available. The Company owns numerous trademarks connected with its piping and leak detection systems throughout the world.

Suppliers. The basic raw materials used in production are pipes and tubes made of carbon steel, steel alloys, copper, ductile iron, or polymers and various chemicals such as polyols, isocyanate, urethane resin, polyethylene, and fiberglass, which are mostly purchased in bulk quantities. The Company believes there are currently adequate supplies and sources of availability of these needed raw materials.
 
The sensor cables used in the Company's leak detection and location systems are manufactured to the Company's specifications by companies regularly engaged in manufacturing such cables. The Company assembles the monitoring component of its leak detection and location systems from components purchased from many sources.
 
The Company's global supply chains have been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the current inflationary environment, raw material supply shortages and transportation delays, the Company routinely experiences significant delays and increased prices for raw materials used in our production processes. To mitigate these impacts, the Company has implemented several strategies, including purchasing from alternative suppliers and planning for material purchases farther in advance to ensure the Company has materials when needed. The Company has also updated its pricing to customers to offset the impacts of the raw material price increases. While these impacts are expected to continue into 2022, the resulting future disruptions to the Company’s operations are uncertain.
 
Competition. The piping systems market is highly competitive. The Company believes its principal competition consists of over 20 major competitors and more small competitors. The Company believes that quality, service, engineering design capabilities and support, a comprehensive product line, timely execution, plant location and price are key competitive factors in the industry. The Company also believes it has a more comprehensive product line than any competitor. 
Research and Development. The Company maintains a standalone research and development function and primarily focuses on activities and development to meet product specifications mandated by its customers and the industry. 
 
Government regulation. The demand for the Company's leak detection and location systems and secondary containment piping systems, which is a small percentage of the Company's total annual piping sales, is driven in the U.S. by federal and state environmental regulation with respect to hazardous waste. The U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act requires, in some cases, that the storage, handling and transportation of fluids through underground pipelines feature secondary containment and leak detection. The U.S. National Emission Standard for hydrocarbon airborne particulates requires reduction of airborne volatile organic compounds and fugitive emissions. Under this regulation, many major refineries are required to recover fugitive vapors and dispose of the recovered material in a process sewer system, which then becomes a hazardous secondary waste system that must be contained. Although there can be no assurances as to the ultimate effects of these governmental regulations, the Company believes such regulations generally increase the demand for its piping systems products.
 
In the United States and Canada, federal government regulations require that all buried oil and gas pipelines that cross state or provincial boundaries or the United States-Canada border, have an anti-corrosion coating system applied. The Company believes that this regulation has a positive effect on demand for its products due to the Company's unique expertise with respect to anti-corrosion coating.
 
Environmental impacts. The Company provides insulated pipe for district energy systems. A district energy system is a highly efficient way to provide heating or cooling to nearby buildings. A central plant produces steam or chilled water, hot and/or chilled water that flows through insulated pipes to nearby buildings. The goal of a district energy system is to centralize production to deliver energy efficiency, reduce operating costs, and use less equipment compared to individual buildings with their own boilers and chillers.  In addition, district heating and cooling plants can provide better pollution control than localized boilers and cooling equipment.
 
Employees
 
As of January 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 184 full-time employees working in the United States, of which approximately 64 were under two collective bargaining agreements, one expiring on April 30, 2023, and the other expiring on March 31, 2025. There were approximately 424 full-time employees working at the Company's international locations. The Company considers its relationship with its employees to be good.
