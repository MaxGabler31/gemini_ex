Item 1. Business
Overview 
Laredo is an independent energy company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties, and the transportation of oil and natural gas from such properties, primarily in the Permian Basin in West Texas. The oil and liquids-rich Permian Basin is characterized by multiple target horizons, extensive production histories, long-lived reserves, high drilling success rates and high initial production rates. We currently operate and analyze our results of operations through our two principal business segments: 

• | Exploration and production of oil and natural gas properties - conducted principally by Laredo Petroleum, Inc. through the exploration and development of our acreage in the Permian Basin. As of December 31, 2017, we had assembled 124,843 net acres in the Permian Basin and had total proved reserves, presented on a three-stream basis, of 215,883 MBOE.


• | Midstream and marketing - conducted principally by our wholly-owned subsidiary, LMS. LMS buys, sells, gathers and transports oil, natural gas and water primarily for the account of Laredo. Prior to October 30, 2017, LMS also owned a 49% interest in Medallion Gathering & Processing, LLC ("Medallion"), which owns and operates more than 650 miles of pipeline in the Permian Basin ("Medallion-Midland Basin"). On October 30, 2017, LMS sold its entire 49% interest in Medallion to an unrelated third party (the "Medallion Sale" as more fully described below).

Financial information and other disclosures relating to our business segments are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report (see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report).

Our core assets
Exploration and production
The Permian Basin is comprised of several distinct geological provinces, including the Midland Basin to the east, the Delaware Basin to the west and the Central Platform in the middle. Our primary development and production fairway is located on the east side of the Midland Basin, 35 miles east of Midland, Texas. Our acreage is largely contiguous in the neighboring Texas counties of Howard, Glasscock, Reagan, Sterling and Irion. We refer to this acreage block in this Annual Report as our "Permian-Garden City" area. As of December 31, 2017, we held 124,843 net acres in the Permian Basin, all of which were held in 266 sections in the Permian-Garden City area, with an average working interest of 97% in all Laredo-operated producing wells.
We believe our acreage in the Permian-Garden City area is a resource play for multiple producing formations that make up a significant portion of the entire stratigraphic section. We are currently focusing the majority of our development activities on two horizontal drilling targets (Upper and Middle Wolfcamp formations) that have multiple landing points within each target. In addition, we have also established the existence of additional producing formations, including the Lower Wolfcamp, Cline, Spraberry and Canyon. From our inception in 2006 through December 31, 2017, we have drilled and completed (i.e., the particular well is flowing) 240 horizontal wells in the Upper and Middle Wolfcamp and 967 vertical wells in the Wolfberry interval. Of these 240 horizontal wells, 151 were horizontal Upper Wolfcamp wells and 89 were horizontal Middle Wolfcamp wells. We have also drilled and completed 33 horizontal Lower Wolfcamp wells and 64 horizontal Cline wells. We anticipate focusing our 2018 drilling program on the Upper and Middle Wolfcamp formations due to their lower development cost and superior production expectations. 
Beginning in mid-2012, we started focusing our horizontal activity on drilling longer laterals. Since that time our average lateral length has grown to 10,000 feet and longer in areas where our contiguous acreage position allows. 
As oil, NGL and natural gas prices and related margins have somewhat stabilized (although they are still at reduced levels from highs seen in 2013 and early 2014), we have approved a 2018 capital budget of $555 million, excluding acquisitions. Of this budget, $470 million is allocated to drilling and completion activities and $85 million is allocated to production facilities, land and other capitalized costs. Substantially all of the planned capital budget is anticipated to be invested in the Permian-Garden City area. Our strategy is to continue to concentrate our drilling activities on multi-well packages around our previously established production corridors that have the infrastructure in place to provide us the flexibility to most efficiently and economically drill wells at an attractive rate of return. At the same time, we believe drilling wells in multi-well packages also enables us to minimize the impact of current drilling on future drilling plans. We continue to use our existing data (and acquire new data) to optimize completion designs and well spacing within the development plan to enhance inventory and net asset value. We will also continue to pursue cost saving measures as we seek to continue to improve our capital efficiency; however, as commodity prices have increased, service costs have also risen. We are uncertain if this upward trend on service costs will continue. 
On December 31, 2017, we had a total of four drilling rigs drilling horizontal wells. Our current drilling schedule anticipates that we will utilize three horizontal rigs during the first half of 2018 and add a fourth horizontal rig during the second half of the year. We do not anticipate utilizing any vertical rigs throughout 2018.
The timing of drilling our potential locations is influenced by several factors, including commodity prices, capital requirements and availability, the Texas Railroad Commission ("RRC") well-spacing requirements and the continuation of the positive results from our ongoing development drilling program.
We expect our Permian-Garden City acreage to continue to be the primary driver for the growth of our reserves, production and cash flow for the foreseeable future.
Since our inception, we have established and realized our reserves, production and cash flow primarily through our drilling program, coupled with select strategic acquisitions. Our net proved reserves were estimated at 215,883 MBOE on a three-stream basis as of December 31, 2017, of which 89% are classified as proved developed reserves and 37% are attributed to oil reserves. We report our production volumes on a three-stream basis, which separately reports NGL from crude oil and natural gas. In this Annual Report, the information presented with respect to our estimated proved reserves has been prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. ("Ryder Scott"), our independent reserve engineers, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") applicable to the periods presented.

The following table summarizes our total estimated net proved reserves presented on a three-stream basis, net acreage and producing wells as of December 31, 2017, and average daily production presented on a three-stream basis for the year ended December 31, 2017. Based on estimates in the report prepared by Ryder Scott, we operated wells that represent 99.6% of the economic value of our proved developed oil, NGL and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2017.

(1) | See "—Our operations—Estimated proved reserves" for discussion of the prices utilized to estimate our reserves.

Our net average daily production for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 58,273 BOE/D, 45% of which was oil, 27% of which was NGL and 28% of which was natural gas.
During 2015, commodity prices for crude oil, NGL and natural gas experienced sharp declines, and this downward trend accelerated further into 2016, with crude oil prices reaching a twelve-year low in February 2016. In the second half of 2016 and through 2017, commodity prices increased and stabilized at relatively higher prices but at significantly lower levels than the first half of 2014. Prices continue to remain volatile. Our capital budget for 2018 is $555 million, representing an 11% decrease from 2017 capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions. This budget is based on benchmark pricing of $55 per Bbl of oil and $3 per Mcf of natural gas.
Beginning in 2016, we purposely and significantly reduced the portion of our reserves that had historically been categorized as "proved undeveloped" or "PUD." We adjusted our five-year SEC PUD bookings methodology because we believe it enables us to develop our acreage in the most efficient manner possible and determine which potential locations will be most profitable. We believe that we can optimize the value for our shareholders by maintaining greater flexibility in choosing the specific drilling locations that will most efficiently develop our properties, particularly as technology changes and we continue to further understand the geology of our acreage. 
As our activities to date have indicated, the majority of our acreage represents a resource play. In the near-term, our goal is to drill those locations that we anticipate have the potential to enhance shareholder value. We have determined that the most efficient way to accomplish this is to maintain the flexibility to choose those locations based upon insight gained as we drill and collect data across our acreage, regardless of SEC reserve-booking status. We converted all 31 PUD locations we booked at December 31, 2016 into proved producing locations in 2017. Reducing our future PUD commitments provides us the most flexibility to maximize our rate of return at prevailing conditions and minimize the requirement to drill wells previously assigned, under very different circumstances, as specific PUD locations. Accordingly, for 2018, we have continued to limit our booked PUD locations to those locations that we have a high degree of certainty that we will develop and have made a specific capital commitment to drill within the first six months of 2018. This strategy maintains our flexibility to add new PUD locations and convert other locations to proved developed reserves as we deem appropriate and opportunistic.
We have built an extensive proprietary technical database that includes 597 in-house, core-calibrated petrophysical logs, 1,133 square miles of 3D seismic, 59 microseismic surveys, 1,278 open and cased-hole logging suites, including 148 dipole sonic logs, 6,032 feet of proprietary whole cores in 16 wells, 1,032 sidewall cores in 25 wells, 40 single-zone tests and 46 production logs. Our strategic interest in utilizing our significant technical database is directed at understanding the principles that control hydraulic fracture geometry and potential resource recovery that can then be leveraged during all operational phases of development, with the goal of maximizing the value of our entire asset base. Our reservoir characterization process encompasses four fundamental areas: (i) high-resolution geocellular modeling, (ii) well spacing and completions optimization, (iii) reservoir engineering studies and (iv) predictive analytics.
HRGMs incorporate and integrate the above-described data to provide some of the highest quality three-dimensional characterizations of reservoir, mechanical and natural fracturing properties available with today's technology. Vertical resolution has increased approximately six-fold from our previously described Earth Model following comprehensive improvements in seismic reprocessing, acoustic impedance inversion and depth refinement workflows. Integrating these newly revised data sets with recent advances in sequence stratigraphic correlations and core-calibrated geological facies studies has resulted in an improved technical understanding and depiction of subsurface development potential at a much higher resolution. Improved depth accuracy of HRGM of 10 feet or less has been achieved, facilitating a transition during 2017 to a new "drill to 
10

plan" technical workflow. The drill to plan workflow optimally targets geological landing points within the inferred highest quality reservoir during pre-drill drilling engineering horizontal well-planning activities. This minimizes "on-the-fly" directional target changes during operations, increasing accuracy of well positioning within the perceived best reservoir, reducing time and costs associated with target changes and enhancing operational efficiencies. All of the 2018 planned wells are anticipated to adopt the drill to plan workflow. 
Utilizing the HRGM developed across large portions of Laredo's acreage position, hydraulic fracture and proppant transport models have been utilized to explicitly describe fracture networks. These fracture networks have then been used in conjunction with reservoir simulators to match specific packages of wells with unique landing points and completion designs. These models are then used to assess possible differences in fracture geometry and well productivity due to a multitude of variables, which include but are not limited to, the landing point, well path, proppant loading, fluid loading, proppant concentration, pump rate and perforation design. Additionally, these models can be used for simulation of multi-well packages to assess potential interactions during the completion operation and total recovery factor of the resource in place.
Expanded regional sequence stratigraphic correlations within Laredo's previous scheme facilitates an enhanced framework for co-development of multiple landing points within individual formations. This ability provides the potential for increasing premium inventory within the Upper and Middle Wolfcamp formations. Microseismic analysis advanced our knowledge across various well spacing combinations and individual completion design field trials, improving our understanding of fracture geometry, cluster efficiency and proppant distribution associated with both well spacing and individual completion design. We consider our database a fundamental technical advantage, enabling the above-described workflows to yield critical insights into improved development decision making.
Predictive analytical modeling includes non-linear multivariate regression and machine learning algorithms facilitating the detection and assessment of the impact of individual parameters on fundamental value drivers. Proprietary software and workflows quantify the effects of individual parameters within completion designs, well spacing and rock properties on production. This knowledge can be leveraged to generate optimized, capital-efficient development plans. 
We consider the above technical workflows to be potentially significant tools in optimizing multi-well co-development well packages. We anticipate that 100% of our horizontal wells to be drilled in 2018 will utilize at least some aspects of the above workflows. If our preliminary applications of these workflows are replicated in forward-looking well planning, we anticipate this will positively impact our ability to select optimal multi-well development plans.
Midstream and marketing
Capitalizing on our large contiguous acreage blocks, we have built crude oil, natural gas and/or water systems in five production corridors on our Permian-Garden City acreage. These production corridors are designed to provide a combination of services, including high-pressure centralized natural gas lift systems, crude oil and natural gas gathering and water delivery and takeaway capacity, with certain corridors also capable of accessing recycling facilities. In 2017, we commenced operations at two additional water recycle facilities, increasing our recycling capacity to more than 54,000 Bbls of water per day. Combined, our three water recycling facilities have a storage capacity of 3.6 million Bbls. We believe the fact that these production corridors and associated facilities and infrastructure are already in place will enable us to enhance the value of the 2018 drilling program. 
Additionally, we have built and maintain more than 59 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines to connect Laredo-operated wells in our Permian-Garden City asset, providing a safer and more economic transportation alternative than trucking. We have also installed and maintain 170 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines across our Permian-Garden City acreage, providing us with takeaway optionality that enables us to maintain lower operating pressures and more consistent well performance. Combined, our oil and gas gathering assets provided transportation for 66% of our production in 2017. 
On October 30, 2017, LMS, together with Medallion Midstream Holdings, LLC ("MMH"), which is owned and controlled by an affiliate of The Energy & Minerals Group ("EMG"), completed the sale of 100% of the ownership interests in Medallion to an affiliate of Global Infrastructure Partners ("GIP"), for cash consideration of $1.825 billion, subject to customary post-closing adjustments (the "Medallion Sale"). LMS' net cash proceeds for its 49% ownership interest in Medallion in 2017 were $829.6 million, before post-closing adjustments and taxes, but after deduction of its proportionate share of fees and other expenses associated with the Medallion Sale. On February 1, 2018, closing adjustments were finalized and LMS received additional net cash of $1.7 million, for total net cash proceeds before taxes of $831.3 million. The proceeds were used to pay in-full borrowings on our Senior Secured Credit Facility, to redeem our May 2022 Notes (as defined below) and for working capital purposes. The Medallion Sale closed pursuant to the membership interest purchase and sale agreement, which provides for potential post-closing additional cash consideration that is structured based on GIP's realized profit at exit. There can be no assurance as to when and whether the additional consideration will be paid.

Our midstream and marketing activities continue to focus on achieving increased efficiencies and cost reductions for (i) the transportation and marketing of our oil and natural gas through the utilization of our oil and natural gas gathering systems to provide access to multiple markets and reduce the potential for production shut-ins caused by downstream capacity issues and (ii) the handling of fresh, recycled and produced water. 
We market the majority of production from properties we operate for both our account and the account of the other working interest owners in our operated properties. We sell substantially all of our production under contracts ranging from one month to several years, all at fluctuating market prices. We normally sell production to a relatively limited number of customers, as is customary in the exploration, development and production business; however, we believe that our customer diversification affords us optionality in our sales destination. We have committed a portion of our Permian crude oil production under firm transportation agreements, including with Medallion, which will enhance our ability to move our crude oil out of the Permian Basin and give us access to potentially more favorable Gulf Coast pricing. See Notes 4.a and 13.d to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a further discussion of our firm transportation agreement with Medallion.
As of December 31, 2017, we were committed to deliver for sale or transportation the following fixed quantities of production under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity:
 | Total | 2018 | | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 and after

_____________________________________________________________________________

(1) | BOE equivalents are calculated using a conversion rate of six Mcf per one Bbl.

We have firm field transportation agreements that enable us or the purchasers of our oil production to move oil from our production area to the major market hub of Colorado City, Texas. One of these agreements is with Medallion and it remains in place and unchanged following the Medallion Sale. Effective as of June 1, 2017, we signed a Dedication and Connection Agreement with Medallion whereby we dedicated to Medallion for transportation the oil from a significant portion of our acreage, subject to certain exceptions. We also have a firm transportation agreement to move oil from Colorado City, Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast. We expect to fulfill these firm transportation commitments primarily by utilizing the volumes under our firm sales commitments.
Our production has been substantially equivalent to or greater than our delivery commitments during the three most recent years, and we expect such production will continue to exceed our future commitments. However, in certain instances, we have made payments for natural gas minimum volume commitments and have used spot market oil purchases to meet commitments in certain locations or due to favorable pricing. We anticipate continuing this practice in the future. Also, if our production is not sufficient to satisfy our delivery commitments, we can and may use spot market purchases to fulfill the commitments.
In the current market environment, we believe that we could sell our production to numerous companies so that the loss of any one of our major purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations solely by reason of such loss. For information regarding each of our customers that accounted for 10% or more of our oil, NGL and natural gas revenues during the last three calendar years, see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—The inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us may materially adversely affect our financial results."
Corporate history and structure
Laredo Petroleum, Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed in 2011 for the purpose of merging with Laredo Petroleum, LLC (a Delaware limited liability company formed in 2007) to consummate an IPO in December 2011. Laredo Petroleum, Inc. was the survivor of such merger and currently has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, LMS and GCM. As of December 31, 2017, affiliates of Warburg Pincus LLC ("Warburg Pincus"), our founding member, owned 32.0% of our common stock.

Debt 
Laredo Petroleum, Inc. is the borrower under our Fifth Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility (as amended, the "Senior Secured Credit Facility"), as well as the issuer of our $350 million of 6 1/4% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the "March 2023 Notes") and our $450 million of 5 5/8% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the "January 2022 Notes"). We refer to the March 2023 Notes and the January 2022 Notes collectively as the "Senior Unsecured Notes." Our subsidiaries, LMS and GCM, are guarantors of the obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and Senior Unsecured Notes. The maturity date of our Senior Secured Credit Facility is May 2, 2022, provided that if the January 2022 Notes have not been redeemed or refinanced on or prior to October 17, 2021 (the "Early Maturity Date"), the Senior Secured Credit Facility will mature on such Early Maturity Date. 
 On April 6, 2015 (the "January 2019 Notes Redemption Date"), we used the proceeds of the March 2023 Notes offering to fund a portion of the complete redemption of the Company's then outstanding $550 million of 9 1/2% senior unsecured notes due 2019 (the "January 2019 Notes") at a redemption price of 104.75% of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the January 2019 Notes Redemption Date. On November 29, 2017 (the "May 2022 Notes Redemption Date"), following the Medallion Sale, we redeemed our $500 million of 7 3/8% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the "May 2022 Notes") at a redemption price of 103.688% of the principal amount of the May 2022 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the May 2022 Notes Redemption Date.
Our business strategy 
Our goal is to enhance shareholder value by executing the following strategy:
Maximize the potential net asset value of our asset base by capitalizing on our technical expertise and taking advantage of our drilling optionality and operational flexibility

• | We will continue to leverage our operating and technical expertise to further delineate and develop our core acreage position. We are enhancing value by capitalizing on our extensive database in identifying the optimal landing point, well spacing and completions optimization techniques, thereby capturing more hydrocarbons within the target acreage than might otherwise be possible.


• | We believe that the most efficient and cost-effective way to develop our acreage is through the use of larger multi-well packages in the same or multiple formations, including multiple landing points in a single formation. This approach allows for economies of scale as well as reducing production issues related to pressure depletion.


• | In order to increase our operational flexibility, in the past three years, we deliberately reduced our PUD bookings within our reserves. While this decision impacts our total booked reserves in the short term, we believe that it enhances our ability to grow our proved developed reserves and overall resources by providing us with crucial flexibility in tailoring our drilling and operating plans in a manner that is more cost-efficient and conducive to maximizing the net asset value of our asset base.

Proactively manage risk to limit downside

• | We actively attempt to limit our business and operating risks by focusing on safety, flexibility in our financial profile, operational efficiencies, hedging, controlling costs and developing oil and natural gas takeaway capacity with multiple delivery points.

Deploy our capital in a strategic manner while considering value-enhancing acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, redemptions, delevering and similar transactions

• | We believe that maintaining a strong liquidity position is critical. Therefore, we will be highly selective in the projects that we consider and as we did with the Medallion Sale, we will continue to monitor the market for strategic opportunities that we believe could be accretive and enhance shareholder value. These opportunities may take the form of acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, redemptions, delevering or other similar transactions, any of which could result in the utilization of our Senior Secured Credit Facility and accessing the capital markets.

Continue to hedge our production to protect cash flows, diminish the effects of commodity price fluctuations and maintain upside exposure 

• | During 2017, we realized a significant benefit through our hedging program and the certainty that it provided to our cash flow. In the future, we will continue to seek hedging opportunities on a multi-year basis to further protect our cash flows from commodity price fluctuations while maintaining upside exposure if commodity prices increase.

13

Increase the use of our previously built infrastructure and evaluate opportunities for strategic expansion

• | We believe that our infrastructure provides us with optionality and efficiencies in developing and transporting production from our Permian-Garden City acreage position, as well as providing water transportation and recycling services for a significant portion of our planned drilling activities. Because of the value we ascribe to this infrastructure, we will continue to look for strategic expansion opportunities while maintaining our core strategy of providing marketing optionality for our oil, NGL and natural gas production.

Our competitive strengths
We have a number of competitive strengths that we believe will assist in the successful execution of our business strategy.
Exploration and production
Our extensive Permian technical database

• | We have made a substantial upfront investment in technical data in order to accurately assess reservoir and production characteristics of our largely contiguous acreage. Our extensive proprietary technical data set, in combination with industry-leading technologies and in-house workflows, enables a comprehensive characterization and visualization of the total subsurface resource potential. This in turn facilitates a development planning workflow that seeks to maximize resource recovery and achieve a significant return on capital employed with respect to each discrete development package of wells.

Contiguous acreage position with high working interests and extensive interests in leases held by production containing multiple formations, resulting in a substantial drilling inventory

• | We have 124,843 net acres in the Permian-Garden City area that are largely contiguous with a high average working interest percentage (average working interest of 97% in all Laredo-operated producing wells), are 86% held by production and have identified up to seven targets to date from which we can produce, resulting in a significant drilling inventory. Our contiguous acreage position also enables us to drill long laterals (10,000 feet or greater) in many locations, which we believe provide an even greater rate of return as we continue to refine our spacing, drilling and completions techniques.

Drilling and lease operating efficiencies afforded by our acreage position and production corridors that enable low-cost operations

• | By making upfront investments in production infrastructure on our contiguous acreage position, we are now able to drill and operate in a more efficient and low-cost manner. We believe that this infrastructure will enable us to continue to be a low-cost operator while at the same time drilling productive new wells.

Significant operational control

• | We operate wells that represent 99.6% of the economic value of our proved developed reserves as of December 31, 2017, based on our reserve report prepared by Ryder Scott. We believe that maintaining operating control permits us to better pursue our strategy of enhancing returns through operational and cost efficiencies and maximizing cost-efficient ultimate hydrocarbon recoveries through reservoir analysis and evaluation and continuous improvement of drilling, completions and stimulation techniques. We expect to maintain operating control over most of our potential drilling locations.

Strong corporate governance and institutional investor support

• | Our board of directors is well qualified and represents a meaningful resource to our management team. Our board of directors, which is comprised of representatives of Warburg Pincus, other independent directors and our Chief Executive Officer, has extensive oil and natural gas industry and general business expertise. We actively engage our board of directors, on a regular basis, for their expertise on strategic, financial, governance and risk management activities. In addition, Warburg Pincus has many years of relevant experience in financing and supporting exploration and production companies and management teams. During the last two decades, Warburg Pincus has been the lead investor in many such companies, including two previous companies operated by members of our management team.

Midstream and marketing 
Our production corridors and water recycle facilities enable us to more efficiently develop our acreage and utilize/dispose of water, thus reducing our capital and operating expenses

• | We believe that our previously built production corridors increase field level operating efficiencies in oil and natural gas gathering and takeaway capacity, water supply and operations. We have demonstrated that our production corridors provide us with identified areas within which we can achieve material cost savings and efficiencies through the use of our previously built infrastructure, including water recycling. In addition, drilling wells within these corridors increases our production consistency and enables us to better plan our development program.


• | The use and disposal of water is one of the most challenging aspects of horizontal drilling in the Permian Basin and our production corridors provide us with a reliable and consistent means to ensure that we have the water we need to complete our wells while also providing low-cost takeaway capacity for flowback and produced water.

Extensive infrastructure in place

• | We own and operate more than 248 miles of pipeline in our crude oil and natural gas gathering, fuel gas and gas lift systems in the Permian Basin as of December 31, 2017. These systems and pipelines provide greater operational efficiency and potentially better pricing for our production and enable us to coordinate our activities to connect our wells to market upon completion with minimal pipeline delays.

Firm transportation for a majority of our oil

• | As production in the Permian Basin has increased, the need for firm takeaway capacity has become even more important. We have 30,000 Bbls per day of intra-basin firm transportation capacity for oil and access to four points of delivery. This capacity was not affected by the Medallion Sale. We also have 10,000 Bbls per day of firm transportation capacity from Colorado City, Texas to five points of delivery in the U.S. Gulf Coast. We believe this type of certainty provides us with an advantage in formulating our present and future drilling and operating plans.

Other properties
In addition to our Permian-Garden City acreage, as of December 31, 2017, we held 4,292 net acres in the Palo Duro Basin. Approximately 96% of this acreage will expire in 2018, absent drilling or renegotiation of the applicable leases. We anticipate little or no activity on these properties in 2018.
Our operations
Estimated proved reserves 
Our reserves are reported in three streams: crude oil, NGL and natural gas. In this Annual Report, the information with respect to our estimated proved reserves presented below has been prepared by Ryder Scott, in accordance with applicable SEC rules and regulations.

15

SEC guidelines require companies to use the unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period before differentials ("Benchmark Prices"). The Benchmark Prices are then adjusted for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead ("Realized Prices"). The Realized Prices are held constant and utilized to calculate estimated reserves and the associated discounted future cash flows. The following table presents the Benchmark Prices and Realized Prices for the periods presented:
 | As of December 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016
Benchmark Prices: | | | 
Oil ($/Bbl) | $ | 47.79 | | $ | 39.25

Our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 assume our ability to fund the capital costs necessary for their development and are affected by pricing assumptions. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—Estimating reserves and future net revenues involves uncertainties. Decreases in oil, NGL and natural gas prices, increases in service costs or negative revisions to reserve estimates or assumptions as to future oil, NGL and natural gas prices, may lead to decreased earnings and losses or impairment of oil, NGL and natural gas assets."

Technology used to establish proved reserves
Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil, NGL and natural gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible within five years from a given date forward from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. The term "reasonable certainty" implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil, NGL and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, our internal reserve engineers and Ryder Scott, our independent reserve engineers, employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, open-hole logs, core analyses, geologic maps, available downhole and production data and seismic data. Reserves attributable to producing wells with sufficient production history were estimated using appropriate decline curves, material balance calculations or other performance relationships. Reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations were estimated primarily by performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and the use of geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity. These wells were considered to be analogous based on production performance from the same formation and completion using similar techniques.
During 2015, commodity prices for crude oil, NGL and natural gas experienced sharp declines, and this downward trend accelerated further into 2016, with crude oil prices reaching a twelve-year low in February 2016. In the second half of 2016 and through 2017 commodity prices increased and stabilized at relatively higher prices but significantly lower than prices in the first half of 2014. However, prices continue to remain volatile and below 2014 highs. Our capital budget for 2018, excluding acquisitions, is $555 million, representing an 11% decrease from 2017 capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions. This budget is based on benchmark pricing of $55 per Bbl of oil and $3 per Mcf of natural gas.
Beginning in 2016, we purposely significantly reduced the portion of our reserves that have historically been categorized as "proved undeveloped" or "PUD." We adjusted our five-year SEC PUD bookings methodology because we 
17

believe it enables us to develop our acreage in the most efficient manner possible and determine which potential locations best enhance our overall value. We believe that we can optimize the value for our shareholders by maintaining greater flexibility in choosing the specific drilling locations that will most efficiently develop our properties, particularly as technology changes and we continue to further understand the geology of our acreage. 
As our activities to date have indicated, the majority of our acreage represents a resource play. In the near term, our goal is to drill those locations that we anticipate have the potential to provide the greatest shareholder value. We have determined that the most efficient way to accomplish this is to maintain the flexibility to choose those locations based upon our continuing insight as we drill and collect data across our acreage, regardless of SEC reserve booking status. We converted all 31 PUD locations booked at December 31, 2016 into proved producing locations in 2017. Reducing our future PUD commitments provides us the most flexibility to maximize our rate of return at prevailing conditions and minimize the requirement to drill wells previously assigned, under very different circumstances, as specific PUD locations. Accordingly, for 2018, we have continued to limit our booked PUD locations to those we have a high degree of certainty to believe that we will develop and have made a specific capital commitment to drill within the first six months of 2018. This strategy maintains our flexibility to add new PUD locations and convert other locations to proved developed reserves as our plans deem appropriate and opportunistic.
Qualifications of technical persons and internal controls over reserves estimation process
In accordance with the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and guidelines established by the SEC, Ryder Scott, our independent reserve engineers, estimated 100% of our proved reserve information as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 included in this Annual Report. The technical persons responsible for preparing the reserves estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to Ryder Scott in their reserves estimation process. Our technical team meets regularly with representatives of Ryder Scott to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in Ryder Scott's preparation of the year-end reserves estimates. The Ryder Scott reserve report is reviewed with representatives of Ryder Scott and our internal technical staff before dissemination of the information. 
Our Vice President of Reservoir Engineering is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates. He has more than 18 years of practical experience, with nine years of this experience being in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. He has a Bachelors of Science in Chemical Engineering from Rice University, a Masters of Business Administration from the Kellogg School of Management and a Masters of Engineering Management from Northwestern University. Our Vice President of Reservoir Engineering reports to our Senior Vice President - Exploration & Land. Reserves estimates are reviewed and approved by our senior engineering staff, other members of senior management and our technical staff, our audit committee and our Chief Executive Officer and then submitted to our board of directors for final approval. 
Proved undeveloped reserves
Our proved undeveloped reserves decreased from 25,945 MBOE as of December 31, 2016 to 24,574 MBOE as of December 31, 2017. We estimate that we incurred $223.8 million of costs to convert 25,945 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves from 31 locations into proved developed reserves in 2017. New proved undeveloped reserves of 15,936 MBOE were added during the year from 18 new horizontal Wolfcamp locations. Positive revisions to proved undeveloped reserves of 8,638 MBOE were due to adding eight undeveloped locations that were removed from reserves in a previous year. A final investment decision has been made on these 26 locations and they are scheduled to be drilled and completed in 2018. 
Estimated total future development and abandonment costs related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves as shown in our December 31, 2017 reserve report are $212.0 million. Based on this report and our PUD booking methodology, the capital estimated to be spent in 2018 to develop the proved undeveloped reserves is $210.0 million and $0 for each of 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. Based on our anticipated cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as the availability of capital markets transactions, all of the proved undeveloped locations are expected to be drilled within the first six months of 2018. Reserve calculations at any end-of-year period are representative of our development plans at that time. Changes in circumstance, including commodity pricing, oilfield service costs, technology, acreage position and availability and other economic and regulatory factors may lead to changes in development plans.

Productive wells
The following table sets forth certain information regarding productive wells in each of our core areas as of December 31, 2017. All but three of our wells are classified as oil wells, all of which also produce liquids-rich natural gas and condensate. Wells are classified as oil or natural gas wells according to the predominant production stream. We also own royalty and overriding royalty interests in a small number of wells in which we do not own a working interest.

Title to properties
We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards. As is customary in the industry, in the case of undeveloped properties, often cursory investigation of record title is made at the time of lease acquisition. Investigations are made before the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. Individual properties may be subject to burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect the value of the properties. Burdens on properties may include customary royalty interests, liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes, obligations or duties under applicable laws, development obligations under oil and gas leases or net profit interests.
Oil and natural gas leases 
The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil, NGL and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises. The lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 12.5% to 25%, resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 75% to 87.5%. As of December 31, 2017, 83% of all of our net leasehold acreage was HBP and 86% of our Permian-Garden City acreage was HBP.
Seasonality
Demand for oil and natural gas generally decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the summer and winter months. However, seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or mild summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. These seasonal anomalies can increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay our operations.
Competition
The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with a wide range of companies in our industry, including those that have greater resources than we do and those that are smaller with fewer ongoing obligations. Many of the larger companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. Many of the smaller companies have a lower cost structure and more liquidity. These companies may be able to pay more for productive properties and exploratory locations or evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and locations than our financial or human resources permit and may be able to expend greater resources to attract and maintain industry personnel. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration and production activities during periods of low market prices. Our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because of the inherent advantages of some of our competitors, those companies may have an advantage in bidding for exploratory and producing properties.
21

Hydraulic fracturing
We use hydraulic fracturing as a means to maximize the productivity of almost every well that we drill and complete. Hydraulic fracturing is a necessary part of the completion process for our producing properties in Texas because our properties are dependent upon our ability to effectively fracture the producing formations in order to produce at economic rates. We are currently conducting hydraulic fracturing activity in the completion of our wells in the Permian Basin. While hydraulic fracturing is not required to maintain any of our leasehold acreage that is currently held by production from existing wells, it will be required in the future to develop the proved non-producing and proved undeveloped reserves associated with this acreage. Nearly all of our proved undeveloped reserves associated with future drilling, recompletion and refracture stimulation projects require hydraulic fracturing.
We have and continue to follow standard industry practices and applicable legal requirements. State and federal regulators impose requirements on our operations designed to ensure protection of human health and the environment. These protective measures include setting surface casing at a depth sufficient to protect fresh water formations and cementing the well to create a permanent isolating barrier between the casing pipe and surrounding geological formations. This well design is intended to eliminate a pathway for the fracturing fluid to contact any aquifers during the hydraulic fracturing operations. For recompletions of existing wells, the production casing is pressure tested prior to perforating the new completion interval.
Injection rates and pressures are monitored instantaneously and in real time at the surface during our hydraulic fracturing operations. Pressure is monitored on both the injection string and the immediate annulus to the injection string. Hydraulic fracturing operations would be shut down immediately if an abrupt change occurred to the injection pressure or annular pressure.
Certain state regulations require disclosure of the components in the solutions used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Approximately 99% of the hydraulic fracturing fluids we use are made up of water and sand. The remainder of the constituents in the fracturing fluid are managed and used in accordance with applicable requirements. In accordance with Texas regulations, we report the constituents of the hydraulic fracturing fluids utilized in our well completions on FracFocus (www.fracfocus.org). Hydraulic fracture stimulation requires the use of a significant volume of water. Upon flowback of the water, we dispose of it by recycling or by discharging into the approved disposal wells. We currently do not discharge water to the surface. Based upon results of testing the performance of recycled flowback/produced water in our fracing operations, we have constructed and currently operate three water recycle facilities on our production corridors providing a recycling capacity of more than 54,000 Bbls of water per day, and a storage capacity of more than 3.6 million Bbls. 
For information regarding existing and proposed governmental regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters, please read "-Regulation of environmental and occupational health and safety matters-Hydraulic fracturing." For related risks to our stockholders, please read "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—Federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and water disposal wells could prohibit projects or result in materially increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays because of the significance of hydraulic fracturing and water disposal wells in our business."
Regulation of the oil and natural gas industry
Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, the production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The State of Texas has regulations governing environmental and conservation matters, including provisions for the pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the permitting of allocation wells, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells (including the proration of production to the market demand for oil, NGL and natural gas), the regulation of well spacing, the handling and disposing or discharge of waste materials and plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil, NGL and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, Texas imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, NGL and natural gas within its jurisdiction. Texas further regulates drilling and operating activities by requiring, among other things, permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandonment of wells. The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the natural gas industry are regularly considered by the current administration, Congress, 
22

the states, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective. 
We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered, and such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impacts of compliance.
Regulation of environmental and occupational health and safety matters
Our operations are subject to numerous stringent federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or occupational health and safety. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the EPA, issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures, the noncompliance with which carries substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations to remediate noncompliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, production and transporting through pipelines, govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling, completion and production process, limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, frontier, seismically active areas and other protected areas, require some form of remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from current or former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations or failure to comply with regulatory filings. In addition, these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of production. 
Certain of these laws and regulations impose strict liability (i.e., no showing of "fault" is required) that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several. Public interest in the protection of the environment has tended to increase over time. The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the oil and natural gas industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating, waste handling, disposal and clean-up requirements, our business and prospects, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general, could be materially adversely affected.
Hazardous substance and waste handling
Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, solid and hazardous wastes, and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict and, in some cases, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws, impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons deemed "responsible parties." These persons include current owners or operators of the site where a release of hazardous substances occurred, prior owners or operators that owned or operated the site at the time of the release or disposal of hazardous substances, and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons. Despite the "petroleum exclusion" of Section 101(14) of CERCLA, which currently encompasses natural gas, we may nonetheless handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. In addition, we may have liability for releases of hazardous substances at our properties by prior owners or operators or other third parties. Finally, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file common law based claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment.
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the "OPA") is the primary federal law imposing oil spill liability. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the United States, including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs. Under the OPA, strict, joint and several liability may be imposed on "responsible parties" for all containment and clean-up costs and 
23

certain other damages arising from a release, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters and natural resource damages, resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. A "responsible party" includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility. The OPA establishes a liability limit for onshore facilities, but these liability limits may not apply if: a spill is caused by a party's gross negligence or willful misconduct; the spill resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation; or a party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up. We are also subject to analogous state statutes that impose liabilities with respect to oil spills. 
We also generate solid wastes, including hazardous wastes, which are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable state statutes. Although RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Certain petroleum production wastes are excluded from RCRA's hazardous waste regulations. These wastes, instead, are regulated under RCRA's less stringent solid waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. It is also possible that these wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, will be designated as "hazardous wastes" in the future and, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes as "hazardous wastes." Also, in December 2016, the EPA agreed in a consent decree to review its regulation of oil and gas waste. It has until March 2019 to determine whether any revisions are necessary. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses.
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the requirements of CERCLA, RCRA, OPA and related state and local laws and regulations, and that we hold all necessary and up-to-date permits, registrations and other authorizations required under such laws and regulations. Although we believe that the current costs of managing our wastes as they are presently classified are reflected in our budget, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes.
Water and other waste discharges and spills
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA"), the OPA and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas wastes, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. The discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, is also prohibited, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps"). On June 29, 2015, the EPA and the Corps jointly promulgated final rules redefining the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act. To the extent the rule expands the range of properties subject to the Clean Water Act's jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. Following its promulgation, numerous states and industry groups challenged the rule and, on October 9, 2015, a federal court stayed the rule's implementation nationwide, pending further action in court. In response to this decision, the EPA and the Corps have resumed nationwide use of the agencies' prior regulations defining the term "waters of the United States." Further, on February 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the relevant executive agencies to review the rules and to initiate rulemaking to rescind or revise them, as appropriate under the stated policies of protecting navigable waters from pollution while promoting economic growth, reducing uncertainty, and showing due regard for Congress and the states. On July 27, 2017, the EPA and the Corps published a proposed rule to rescind the 2015 rules, and, on November 22, 2017, the agencies published a proposed rule to maintain the status quo pending the agencies review of the 2015 rules.
The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. The State of Texas also maintains groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. The underground injection of fluids is subject to permitting and other requirements under state laws and regulation. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. These same regulatory programs also limit the total volume of water that can be discharged, hence limiting the rate of development, and require us to incur compliance costs. 
These laws and any implementing regulations provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other substances and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and the underground injection of fluids and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as "SPCC plans," in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. We maintain all required discharge permits necessary to conduct our operations, and we believe we are in substantial compliance with their terms.

Hydraulic fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is a practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The SDWA regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control Program (the "UIC"). However, hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the UIC, and thus the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. Nevertheless, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the UIC. Under this assertion of authority, the EPA requires facilities to obtain permits to use diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing operations, specifically in Class II wells, which are those wells injecting fluids associated with oil and natural gas production activities. The U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005, which exempts hydraulic fracturing from regulation under the SDWA, prohibits the use of diesel fuel in the fracturing process without a UIC permit. On February 12, 2014, the EPA published a revised UIC Program permitting guidance for oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing activities using diesel fuel. The guidance document describes how Class II regulations may be tailored to address the purported unique risks of diesel fuel injection during the hydraulic fracturing process. Although the EPA is not the permitting authority for UIC Class II programs in Texas, where we maintain acreage, the EPA is encouraging state programs to review and consider use of this permit guidance. Furthermore, legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of Congress to repeal the hydraulic fracturing exemption from the SDWA, provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and require public disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. 
In addition, the EPA previously announced its plans to develop a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by June 2018, which would describe a proposed mechanism (regulatory, voluntary or a combination of both) to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures. Also, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment, or CWT, facilities) accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities. We cannot predict the impact that these actions may have on our business at this time, but further regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
Also, on March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (the "BLM") published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, implementation of a casing and cementing program, management of recovered fluids, and submission to the BLM of detailed information about the proposed operation, including wellbore geology, the location of faults and fractures, and the depths of all usable water. On June 21, 2016, the United States District Court for Wyoming set aside the rule, holding that the BLM lacked Congressional authority to promulgate the rule. The BLM has appealed the decision to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the BLM to review the rule, and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise it. Accordingly, on December 29, 2017, the BLM published a final rule to rescind the 2015 hydraulic fracturing rule. Further legal challenges are expected. At this time, it is uncertain when, or if, the rule will be implemented, and what impact it would have on our operations.
Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanism.
Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose additional requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities or otherwise require the public disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, pursuant to legislation adopted by the State of Texas in June 2011, beginning February 1, 2012, companies were required to disclose to the RRC and the public the chemical components used in the hydraulic fracturing process, as well as the volume of water used. Also, in May 2013, the RRC adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. The new rules took effect in January 2014. Additionally, on October 28, 2014, the RRC adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, among other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will 
25

receive non-hazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed, new disposal well. The disposal well rule amendments, which became effective on November 17, 2014, also clarify the RRC's authority to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. The RRC has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells. In addition to state law, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular.
A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country alleging that hydraulic fracturing practices have induced seismic activity and adversely impacted drinking water supplies, use of surface water, and the environment generally. Several states and municipalities have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. If these or any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to drill and produce from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. These developments, as well as new laws or regulations, could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business that may arise if federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing is enacted into law.
Air emissions
The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including compressor stations, through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. Also, on May 12, 2016, the EPA issued a final rule regarding the criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.
In August 2012, the EPA published final rules that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, and storage operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ("NESHAP"). The rules include NSPS for completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells and establish specific new requirements for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage vessels, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. The final rules seek to achieve a 95% reduction in volatile organic compounds ("VOC") emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or "green completions" on all hydraulically-fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community, and court challenges to the rules were also filed. In response, the EPA has issued, and will likely continue to issue, revised rules responsive to some of these requests for reconsideration. In particular, on May 12, 2016, the EPA amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and VOC emissions for certain new, modified and reconstructed equipment, processes and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. However, in a March 28, 2017 executive order, President Trump directed the EPA to review the 2016 regulations and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them consistent with the stated policy of promoting clean and safe development of the nation's energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production. On June 16, 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay for two years certain requirements of the 2016 regulations, including fugitive emission requirements. 
In addition, on November 15, 2016, the BLM finalized a rule to reduce the flaring, venting and leaking of methane from oil and gas operations on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires operators to use currently available technologies and equipment to reduce flaring, periodically inspect their operations for leaks, and replace outdated equipment that vents large quantities of gas into the air. The rule also clarifies when operators owe the government royalties for flared gas. State and industry groups have challenged this rule in federal court, asserting that the BLM lacks authority to prescribe air quality regulations. On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the BLM to review the above rule and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise it. Accordingly, on December 8, 2017, the BLM published a final rule to suspend or delay certain requirements of the 2016 methane rule until January 17, 2019. Further legal challenges are 
26

expected. At this time, it is uncertain when, or if, the rule will be implemented, and what impact it would have on our operations.
These standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions.
We have incurred additional capital expenditures to insure compliance with these new regulations as they come into effect. We may also be required to incur additional capital expenditures in the next few years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits addressing other air emission related issues, which may have a material adverse effect on our operations. Obtaining permits also has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. We believe that we currently are in substantial compliance with all air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our current operations.
Regulation of "greenhouse gas" emissions
Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ("GHGs") and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs or other mechanisms. Most cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. As the number of GHG emission allowances declines each year, the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly. Some states have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources.
In addition, in December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment, because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA allow the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. In response to its endangerment finding, the EPA adopted two sets of rules regarding possible future regulation of GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. The motor vehicle rule, which became effective in July 2010, purports to limit emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles. The EPA adopted the stationary source rule (or the "tailoring rule") in May 2010, and it became effective in January 2011. The tailoring rule established new GHG emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration ("PSD") and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act. On June 23, 2014, in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA ("UARG v. EPA"), the Supreme Court held that stationary sources could not become subject to PSD or Title V permitting solely by reason of their GHG emissions. The Court ruled, however, that the EPA may require installation of best available control technology for GHG emissions at sources otherwise subject to the PSD and Title V programs. On August 26, 2016, the EPA proposed changes needed to bring the EPA's air permitting regulations in line with the Supreme Court's decision on greenhouse gas permitting. The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on October 3, 2016 and the public comment period closed on December 2, 2016.
In September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the U.S., including NGL fractionators and local natural gas/distribution companies, beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. In November 2010, the EPA published a final rule expanding the GHG reporting rule to include onshore oil, NGL and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. This rule requires reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities on an annual basis, with reporting beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. In October 2015, the EPA amended the GHG reporting rule to add the reporting of GHG emissions from gathering and boosting systems, completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines. For a more complete description of potential risks that such regulations may impose on our operations, see, "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of 'greenhouse gases' could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil, NGL and natural gas we produce."
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended ("OSHA") and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA's hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations 
27

and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements.
National Environmental Policy Act
Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Departments of Interior and Agriculture, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency prepares an environmental assessment to evaluate the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project. If impacts are considered significant, the agency will prepare a more detailed environmental impact study that is made available for public review and comment. Any exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands would require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This environmental impact assessment process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA also are subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which can delay or halt projects.
Endangered Species Act
The Endangered Species Act ("ESA") was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species or its habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, though, in December 2017, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ("USFWS") provided guidance limiting the reach of the Act. The USFWS may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas, which could adversely impact the value of our leases.
Summary
In summary, we believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental laws and regulations. Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements, there is no assurance that this will continue. We did not have any material capital or other non-recurring expenditures in connection with complying with environmental laws or environmental remediation matters in 2017, 2016 or 2015.
Regulation of oil and gas pipelines
Our oil and gas pipelines are subject to construction, installation, operation and safety regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT") and various other federal, state and local agencies. Congress has enacted several pipeline safety acts over the years. Currently, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") under DOT administers pipeline safety requirements for natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. These regulations, among other things, address pipeline integrity management and pipeline operator qualification rules. In June 2016, Congress approved new pipeline safety legislation, the "Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016" (the "PIPES Act"), which provides the PHMSA with additional authority to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquids pipeline facilities. Significant expenses could be incurred in the future if additional safety measures are required or if safety standards are raised and exceed the current pipeline control system capabilities.
Recently, the PHMSA has proposed additional regulations for gas pipeline safety. For example, in March 2016, the PHMSA proposed a rule that would expand integrity management requirements beyond "High Consequence Areas" to apply to gas pipelines in newly defined "Moderate Consequence Areas." The public comment period closed on July 7, 2016. Also, on January 10, 2017, the PHMSA approved final rules expanding its safety regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines by, among other things, expanding the required use of leak detection systems, requiring more frequent testing for corrosion and other flaws and requiring companies to inspect pipelines in areas affected by extreme weather or natural disasters. The final rule was withdrawn by the PHMSA in January 2017, and it is unclear whether and to what extent the PHMSA will move forward with its regulatory reforms.
Disclosures required pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, we are required to include certain disclosures in our periodic reports if we or any of our "affiliates" (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) knowingly engaged in certain specified activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with certain individuals or entities targeted by United States' economic sanctions during the period covered by the report. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or 
28

dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. Neither we nor any of our controlled affiliates or subsidiaries knowingly engaged in any of the specified activities relating to Iran or otherwise engaged in any activities associated with Iran during the reporting period. However, because the SEC defines the term "affiliate" broadly, it includes any entity controlled by us as well as any person or entity that controlled us or is under common control with us.
The description of the activities below has been provided to us by Warburg Pincus, affiliates of which: (i) beneficially own more than 10% of our outstanding common stock and are members of our board of directors and (ii) beneficially own more than 10% of the equity interests of, and have the right to designate members of the board of directors of Santander Asset Management Investment Holdings Limited ("SAMIH"). SAMIH may therefore be deemed to be under "common control" with us; however, this statement is not meant to be an admission that common control exists.
The disclosure below relates solely to activities conducted by SAMIH and its affiliates. The disclosure does not relate to any activities conducted by Laredo or by Warburg Pincus and does not involve our or Warburg Pincus' management. Neither Laredo nor Warburg Pincus had any involvement in or control over the disclosed activities of SAMIH, and neither Laredo nor Warburg Pincus has independently verified or participated in the preparation of the disclosure.
