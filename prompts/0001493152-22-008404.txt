ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company Background and Nature of Business
 
eWellness Healthcare Corporation (the “eWellness”, “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 7, 2011.
 
eWellness Healthcare Corporation is the first physical therapy telehealth company to offer real-time distance monitored assessments and treatments. On September 15, 2020, the Company and Bistromatics signed an agreement that transferred all worldwide marketing and Intellectual Property Rights or claims to the Company’s Phzio, Phzio TeleRehab and MSK 360 platforms to Bistromatics in return for a 15% ownership in Bistromatics. This agreement eliminated all past due professional fees of $748,832. The transfer of rights was completed on December 31, 2020.
 
During the last quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors and management determined that while it would continue its efforts and resources involving physical therapy and telemedicine, it would also pursue other health-related business opportunities. With the Company’s announced plan to diversify its health-related business beyond its telemedicine operations, which telemedicine operations will continue, the Company on May 18, 2021, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and between the Company, EWLL Acquisition (a new wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) and a recently formed private Nevada company controlled by a third party, American Health Protection, Inc.(“AMHP”). pursuant to which AMHP merged with EWLL Acquisition, with AMHP being the surviving entity and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. On July 14, 2021, the Company filed the requisite Articles of Merger with the State of Nevada and, as a result, AMHP became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and EWLL Acquisition ceased to exist.
 
On April 19, 2021, the Company filed a DEF 14C to disclose to the stockholders the ratification and approval by Joint Written Consent, based upon the unanimous approval by our Board of Directors and the consent of the Majority Consenting Stockholders, of the corporate actions to file an amendment to its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to: (i) change the name of the Company from eWellness Healthcare Corporation to American Health Protection Corp. (“Name Change”); (ii) change the par value of the Company’s common stock and preferred stock from $0.001 per share to $0.0001 per share (“Par Value Change”); and (iii) implement the 1:2,000 reverse split of our Common Stock and the shares underlying conversion of the Company’s securities convertible into Common Stock together with the shares reserved for such conversions, on a one for two thousand (1:2,000) basis (“Reverse Split”). The Name Change, Par Value Change and Reverse Split are sometimes referred to as the “Corporate Actions”, which Corporate Actions must be approved by FINRA. The application for approval of these actions to FINRA has not yet been filed.
 
As stated in the DEF 14C, the Name Change from eWellness Healthcare Corporation to American Health Protection Corp. was to reflect the Company’s plan to diversify its business operations from the telemedicine business and the proprietary PHZIO System to include other health related services to its primary target market focused on small and mid-sized corporate clients. The Par Value Change of the Company’s Common Stock and Preferred Stock from $0.001 per share to $0.0001 per share was the result that for more than the past six months (preceding the filing of the DEF 14C), the price of its Common Stock on the OTC Markets had been less than the $0.001 par value of its Common Stock. As a result, the Company had not been able to raise capital by the issuance of shares of Common Stock at less than the $0.001 par value and, in addition, the Company could not raise capital through the issuance of shares of convertible Preferred Stock having a conversion price of less than the $0.001 par value of the Common Stock. Lastly, the rationale for the Reverse Split of the outstanding shares of Common Stock on a one for two thousand (1:2,000) basis was needed because the outstanding shares and shares reserved for convertible debt conversion resulted in no shares being available for capital raise purposes.
