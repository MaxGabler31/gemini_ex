1Note: See reconciliation to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
RAILWAY OPERATING REVENUES – Total railway operating revenues were $10.6 billion in 2017.  Following is an overview of our three major market groups. See the discussion of merchandise revenues by commodity group, intermodal revenues, and coal revenues and tonnage in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

MERCHANDISE – Our merchandise market group is composed of five major commodity groupings: 

• | Chemicals includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products (including crude oil), chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, and chemical wastes.


• | Agriculture, consumer products, and government includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizer, livestock and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products, ethanol, transportation equipment, and items for the U.S. military.


• | Metals and construction includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, sand, and minerals.


• | Automotive includes finished motor vehicles and automotive parts.

K 5


• | Paper, clay and forest products includes lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper products, wood fibers, wood pulp, scrap paper, and clay.

Merchandise carloads handled in 2017 were 2.5 million, the revenues from which accounted for 60% of our total railway operating revenues.
INTERMODAL – Our intermodal market group consists of shipments moving in domestic and international containers and trailers.  These shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers, and other shippers.  Intermodal units handled in 2017 were 4.1 million, the revenues from which accounted for 23% of our total railway operating revenues.

COAL – Revenues from coal accounted for 17% of our total railway operating revenues in 2017.  We handled 116 million tons, or 1.0 million carloads, in 2017, most of which originated on our lines from major eastern coal basins, with the balance from major western coal basins received via the Memphis and Chicago gateways.  Our coal franchise supports the electric generation market, serving approximately 76 coal generation plants, as well as the export, domestic metallurgical and industrial markets, primarily through direct rail and river, lake, and coastal facilities, including various terminals on the Ohio River, Lamberts Point in Norfolk, Virginia, the Port of Baltimore, and Lake Erie.
FREIGHT RATES – Our predominant pricing mechanisms, private contracts and exempt price quotes, are not subject to regulation. In general, market forces are the primary determinant of rail service prices.

In 2017, our railroad was found by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB), the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices, to be “revenue adequate” on an annual basis based on results for the year 2016.  The STB has not made its revenue adequacy determination for the year 2017.  A railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital.  This determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement. 

RAILWAY PROPERTY

Our railroad infrastructure makes us capital intensive with net property of approximately $30 billion on a historical cost basis.
Property Additions – Property additions for the past five years were as follows:

 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 | 2013
 | ($ in millions)
Road and other property | $ | 1,210 | | | $ | 1,292 | | $ | 1,514 | $ | 1,406 | $ | 1,421
Equipment | 513 | | | 595 | | | 658 | | 712 | 550 |

Total | $ | 1,723 | | | $ | 1,887 | | $ | 2,385 | $ | 2,118 | $ | 1,971

Our capital spending and replacement programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe, efficient, and reliable rail transportation services.  For 2018, we have budgeted $1.8 billion of property additions.

The following table shows the average age of our owned locomotive and freight car fleets at December 31, 2017, and information regarding 2017 retirements:


 | Locomotives | Freight Cars
Average age – in service | 24.4 years | 28.5 years 
Retirements | 180 units | 6,947 units 
Average age – retired | 33.2 years | 44.7 years 

Track Maintenance – Of the approximately 35,700 total miles of track on which we operate, we are responsible for maintaining approximately 28,500 miles, with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance.

Over 83% of the main line trackage (including first, second, third, and branch main tracks, all excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights) has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per yard.  Approximately 46% of our lines, excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights, carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile during 2017.

The following table summarizes several measurements regarding our track roadway additions and replacements during the past five years:

 | 2017 | 2016 | | 2015 | 2014 | 2013
Track miles of rail installed | 466 | | 518 | | 523 | | 507 | 549 
Miles of track surfaced | 5,368 | | 4,984 | | 5,074 | | 5,248 | 5,475
Crossties installed (millions) | 2.5 | | 2.3 | | 2.4 | | 2.7 | 2.5 

Traffic Control – Of the approximately 16,400 route miles we dispatch, about 11,300 miles are signalized, including 8,500 miles of centralized traffic control (CTC) and 2,800 miles of automatic block signals.  Of the 8,500 miles of CTC, approximately 7,600 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 355 base station radio sites.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS – Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is one of our principal goals.  To date, such compliance has not had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or competitive position. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

EMPLOYEES – The following table shows the average number of employees and the average cost per employee for wages and benefits: 

 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 | 2013
Average number of employees | 27,110 | | | 28,044 | | | 30,456 | | 29,482 | 30,103 |

GOVERNMENT REGULATION – In addition to environmental, safety, securities, and other regulations generally applicable to all business, our railroads are subject to regulation by the STB.  The STB has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates, routes, customer access provisions, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.  The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers. 

The relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, following the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, included exemption from STB regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business (trailer-on-flat-car, container-on-flat-car), rail boxcar shipments, lumber, manufactured steel, automobiles, and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel, pulpwood, and wood chips for paper manufacturing.  Further, all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from commercial regulation for the duration of the contract.  Approximately 90% of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving under transportation contracts; the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates.

Efforts have been made over the past several years to increase federal economic regulation of the rail industry, and such efforts are expected to continue in 2018.  The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 substantially balanced the interests of shippers and rail carriers, and encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate, invest in their infrastructure, and compete for business, thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry.  Accordingly, we will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation. 

Government regulations are discussed within Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and the safety and security of our railroads are discussed within the “Security of Operations” section contained herein.

COMPETITION – There is continuing strong competition among rail, water, and highway carriers.  Price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company. Inventory carrying costs, service reliability, ease of handling, and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations, especially for higher-valued finished goods, machinery, and consumer products.  Even for raw materials, semi-finished goods, and work-in-progress, users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages.
Our primary rail competitor is CSX Corporation (CSX); both NS and CSX operate throughout much of the same territory. Other railroads also operate in parts of the territory.  We also compete with motor carriers, water carriers, and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage, sourcing products from different geographic areas, and using substitute products.

Certain marketing strategies to expand reach and shipping options among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable railroads to compete more effectively in specific markets. 
SECURITY OF OPERATIONS – We continue to enhance the security of our rail system. Our comprehensive security plan is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) post September 11, 2001.  The AAR Security Plan defines four Alert Levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as a terrorist threat increases or decreases.  The Alert Level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas:  (1) operations (including transportation, engineering, and mechanical); (2) information technology and communications; and, (3) railroad police.  All of our Operations Division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers, as appropriate, of any change in Alert Level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change. 
Our plan also complies with U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials.  As part of the plan, security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety, and is integrated into hazardous material training programs.  Additionally, location-specific security plans are in place for certain metropolitan areas and each of the six facilities we operate that are under U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) 
K 9

Maritime Security Regulations.  With respect to these facilities, each facility’s security plan has been approved by the applicable Captain of the Port and remains subject to inspection by the USCG.

Additionally, we continue to engage in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the USCG, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Defense, and various state Homeland Security offices.  Similarly, we follow guidance from DHS and DOT regarding rail corridors in High Threat Urban Areas (HTUA). Particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in HTUA by:  (1) the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxic-by-inhalation (TIH) materials; (2) the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying TIH materials; (3) substantially reducing the number of unattended loaded tank cars carrying TIH materials; and (4) cooperation with federal, state, local, and tribal governments to identify those locations where security risks are the highest.     
In 2017, through participation in the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response (TRANSCAER) Program, we provided rail accident response training to approximately 8,185 emergency responders, such as local police and fire personnel. Our other training efforts throughout 2017 included participation in drills for local, state, and federal agencies.  We also have ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the Security and Emergency Response Training Course conducted at the AAR Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, Colorado.
