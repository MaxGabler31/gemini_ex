ITEM 1
BUSINESS
 
Barrel Energy Inc (“Barrel” or the “Company”) was incorporated on January 27, 2014, under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company was formed to invest in the energy sector. On September 26, 2014, the Company leased the Bison Property, an unproven oil and gas project in the province of Alberta, Canada. The Bison property is comprised of four sections of interest (land totaling 2,560 acres located in northwestern Alberta in an area called the Peace River Arch an area known for its prolific oil and natural gas wells and is one of the most desirable light oil and natural gas liquids drilling areas in North America.
 
On October 11, 2018, the Company entered into an Earn-In Agreement with True Grit Resources, a British Columbia corporation (“TGR”), an unrelated third party. In exchange for the stepped payments by the Company, Barrel could earn of to 100% participation interest in certain mineral rights leases that TGR held in Arizona. The Company was to earn a 70% interest by expending a cumulative $1,400,000 on the property and to secure the 100% participation interest. The Company was required to expend a cumulative amount of payments and property expenditures of $2,400,000. 
 
On November 5, 2018, the Company received an extension for the initial payments of $400,000 to maintain the earn in agreement. On January 19, 2019, after a thorough review of supporting information on the project, the Company terminated the earn-in agreement with True Grit Resources.
 
On April 11, 2019, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to increase its number of authorized shares of common stock to 450,000,000.
 
On May 14, 2019, Barrel entered into a 10 year land Lease with Crocker Acana, LLC on 602 acres of land in Tehama County, California. The Company’s intent was to farm the land to grow hemp, which required a permit from the Tehama County government. A permit was not acquired and after thorough examination of the State and Federal regulations, the Company has not yet reapplied. 
 
On November 26, 2019, the Company entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent with ZB Holdings, Inc. (“ZB”) to acquire the assets of ZB pursuant to a definitive agreement to be formalized. ZB, with headquarters, manufacturing and distribution facilities located in Katy, Texas, is a consumer products company in the business of producing and marketing sporting goods apparel and safety apparel through a proprietary and trademarked design and production technique. Under the proposed transaction, the Company was to acquire 100% of the assets of ZB, and ZB was to acquire 40% of the fully diluted shares of common stock of the Company. The transaction could be terminated if not completed by March 31, 2020. The transaction was terminated.
 
In early April, 2020 the Company reviewed the changing business landscape brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. Oil prices had dropped considerably and the sporting activities nearly came to a full stop with cancellation of events across the country. On April 7, 2020, the Company decided to cease its plans to acquire ZB Holdings and terminate the conditions of the Letter of Intent. On April 7, 2020, the Company also relinquished any further claim or work commitments on the Bison Oil and Gas Project in Northern Alberta.
 
Barrel’s Main Product and Focus
 
At present, the Company does not have any production of a commercial product and the Company has not earned any revenues to date. The Company has divested itself of various ventures and future plans are to engage in the exploration and production of supporting products for Electric Vehicles, which would include both battery materials, such as Lithium Carbonate or Lithium Hydroxide, and battery production.

The Company is returning its focus, targeting areas with potential economic concentrations of Lithium, Cobalt and Graphite, that will be in critical demand to service the energy needs of high growth battery materials.
 
The growth in demand for lithium batteries is predicted to outpace the lithium production in the coming decade. Lithium-ion batteries for the automotive industry are expected to advance demand to nearly unserviceable levels. These industry trends enhance the Company’s new business model.
 
Market and Industry
 
Interest in Lithium ore is very high with Lithium being extracted from primarily two sources: pegmatite crystals and lithium salts from brine pools. Currently, the world’s five top producers of Lithium are Australia, Chile, China, Argentina and Zimbabwe.
 
In 2019 worldwide production totaled approximately 77,000 metric tons, with the top 3 countries contributing the majority of the global production. Much of the current production of Lithium (i.e. Australia) is from conventional mining techniques of ancient Precambrian rocks containing Lithium ore, which is crushed and fed into capital intensive processing plants to upgrade the lithium mineral using gravity, flotation, magnetic and roasting processes. 
 
Alternatively, Lithium production in Chile and Argentina uses a much less capital intense method. Lithium is located beneath flat, arid salt flats. The Lithium leaches from nearby source rocks and concentrated in salty brines, just under the surface. Here, Lithium enriched brines are pumped to settle on hundreds of shallow surface evaporation pools, which produces a thicker Lithium rich liquid. That liquid is treated with sodium carbonate, precipitating lithium carbonate.
 
Lithium brine development has proven to be faster to start production than the hard rock mine counterparts. Brine is a liquid, which means, drilling to find it is more akin to drilling for water. Once a Lithium Brine is identified, the continuity is more straightforward to understand and quantify than the typically irregular pegmatite body. New direct Lithium extraction techniques being developed will help minimize the environmental impact of Brine production.
 
Lithium clay deposits represent a significant and as yet untapped natural resource. Along with lithium brines and pegmatites, the clay can supply the exponentially growing lithium battery market for electric vehicles, as well as for laptops and cell phones. Current indications are that lithium clay deposits have favorable economics that are comparable to large lithium brine projects in Argentina and Chile.
 
Lithium (Li) is a soft silver-white metal. With an atomic number of 3, it is the lightest of the metals, only the gases Hydrogen (atomic number 1) and Helium (atomic number 2) being lighter. Light weight Lithium has many applications, but the metal is a perfect replacement of the much heavier Nickel used in most large batteries. Lithium batteries also have a high charge density, a longer life and are rechargeable.
 
The Lithium market has typically been dominated by the ceramic and medical sector. However, 2015 presented a marked change in the market as the demand for Lithium for the battery market outstripped any other sector.
 
At the moment, the main lithium-ion battery-makers are Samsung and LG of South Korea, Panasonic and Sony of Japan, and ATL of Hong Kong. China has many battery factories being built furthering the demand for Lithium.

Lithium is not traded publicly and is usually distributed in a chemical form such as Lithium carbonate (Li2CO3. It is sold directly to end users for a negotiated price per ton. The price increased greatly in 2018 and has since contracted, however prices are projected to rise with coming demand.
 
General Market Trends
 
For Lithium, Lithium-ion batteries have become the rechargeable battery of choice in cell phones, computers, electric cars and larger scale electric storage. The growth in demand for lithium batteries is predicted to far outpace lithium production in the coming decade. In particular, Lithium-ion batteries for the automotive industry is expected to advance demand to nearly unserviceable levels.
 
Goldman Sachs predicted that the market consumption could very well triple from the current production by 2025. Just a 1% increase of Electric Vehicles could increase lithium demand by roughly half of the todays lithium production. The largest Lithium producers, SQM, FMC and Albemarle are increasing production, but such efforts are predicted to fall short of the on-coming demand.
 
Tesla’s mile long Gigafactory started producing powerful Lithium-ion batteries in 2017 with their partner Panasonic. The Gigafactory is expected to supply batteries for the 500,000 cars Tesla hopes to produce by the end of the decade, as well as to power homes. Additionally, Chrysler, Dodge, Ford, GM, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Saturn, Tesla and Toyota have all announced plans to build lithium-ion battery powered cars. Preorders of the new Tesla model 3 have sold out to 400,000 and are currently in production. Elon Musk has stated that Tesla will have to acquire the entire lithium market to meet the current demands.
 Environmental policy data trends point to future energy development that is characterized by being efficient, sustainable and clean. These policy changes and Battery technology innovations such as higher charge density and reductions in weight, charge time and cost have precipitated a pivot in the Auto Industry to Electric Vehicle (EVs).
 
Key Countries that have announced major policy changes that will affect the sector are:
 
France & Britain – to end sales of gas and diesel cars by 2040, Germany to follow Scottish Government – phase out gas and diesel cars by 2032
 
India – announced it would end sales of gas and diesel cars by 2030
 
Norway & Netherlands – to end sales of gas and diesel cars by 2025
 
Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Japan, Portugal, Korea and Spain have all set official targets for electric car sales. 
 
China announced it will set a deadline for the end of fossil fuel powered vehicles.
 
The Demand 
 
Global demand for these key materials is expected to rise dramatically over the next decade. The outlook for Lithium will outstrip production with global demand for Lithium expected to increase 650% by 2027. Market demand for Lithium has been predicted to be 470,000 metric tons by 2025. 
 
Barrel Energy is aware that most analysts see an upcoming bull market for Lithium, Cobalt and Graphite and sourcing of the raw materials for the Lithium-ion battery supply chain is a strategic focus for the company. Lithium is set to be one of the world’s hottest commodities and is attracting the eye of investors who are searching for Battery Metal explorers and production companies that would allow them to get in on the ground floor of the renaissance in Energy Technology.
