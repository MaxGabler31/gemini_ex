ITEM 1 – DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
Overview
 
We were incorporated on December 23, 2003, in Delaware and our principal business is the acquisition and exploration of mineral resources.
 
In January 2021, the company’s Board of Directors approved a name change from Athena Silver Corporation, to Athena Gold Corporation. Athena Gold Corporation (“we,” “our,” “us,” or “Athena”) is engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral resources. We began our mining operations in 2010.
 
We entered into a Mining Lease and Option Agreement which granted us mining rights to the Langtry silver prospect located in San Bernardino County California. Due to the depressed commodities prices over the ensuing decade, we were never able to engage in meaningful exploration efforts. On April 28, 2020, Athena Silver Corporation entered into Agreement to Terminate Lease with Option to Buy dated March 10, 2016 with Bruce and Elizabeth Strachan, Trustees of the Bruce and Elizabeth Strachan Revocable Living Trust dated July 25, 2007, including any and all amendments thereto dated April 28, 2020 with respect to the Langtry Mine in California. As a result of this termination agreement, all scheduled lease option payments due in 2020 and beyond were considered terminated and void upon signing of the Agreement.
 
In December 2009, we formed and organized a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Athena Minerals, Inc. (“Athena Minerals”) which owned and operated our mining interests and properties in California. On December 31, 2020 we sold the subsidiary to John Gibbs and/or his affiliate, a related party, in a non-cash exchange to satisfy our more than $2.0 million debt to Mr. Gibbs which is discussed further below and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
 
Effective December 27, 2021 (“Effective Date”),  the Company simultaneously executed and consummated a definitive Share Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Nubian Resources, Ltd. (“Nubian”). The SPA was the result of a previously disclosed Option Agreement with Nubian dated as of December 11, 2020, as amended by First Amendment to Option Agreement dated November 10, 2021 (the “Option”). While the Option granted the Company the right to acquire up to a 100% interest in the mining claims comprising the Excelsior Springs Prospect (the “Property”) located in Esmerelda County, Nevada, the Company and Nubian agreed to restructure the transaction so that the Company purchased 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Nubian Resources US, Ltd (“Nubian US”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nubian which held the Property. By purchasing 100% of Nubian US, the Company effectively acquired the remaining 90% interest in the Property, the Company having previously acquired a 10% interest in the Property in December 2020 under the terms of the Option.
 
The following is a summary of the terms of the SPA, which summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the SPA:
 

· | The consideration paid to Nubian for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Nubian US consisted of:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | ○ | An aggregate of 50 million shares of Athena Gold Corp. common stock, which number includes the 5 million shares of common stock previously issued to Nubian under the Option; and
 | ○ | A 1% Net Smelter Royalty on all production from the Excelsior Springs Property. 


· | The 50 million shares issued to Nubian were issued as “restricted securities” under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”). However, the Company has agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-1 within 90 days of the Effective Date registering the distribution by Nubian of all 50 million shares to its shareholders, pro rata. Nubian has undertaken to complete the distribution of all the shares once the S-1 registration statement has been declared effective. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Pending completion of the S-1 and distribution of the 50 million shares issued to Nubian, for a period of 12 months following the Effective or until Nubian owns less than 4.9% of the Athena issued and outstanding shares, Nubian has agreed to exercise its voting rights with respect to such shares in a manner to support the recommendations of the Athena Board of Directors except for (i) voting on any proposed change in control transaction or (ii) voting on any proposed sale of all or substantially all of the Excelsior Property, including a property included known as Palmetto.
· | Nubian shall be entitled to nominate one representative to serve on the Athena Board of Directors.

Athena’s agreement with Nubian includes 100% of the 140 unpatented claims at Excelsior Springs with two additional patented claims held under a lease option that are subject to a 2% net smelter returns royalty on gold production.
 
Excelsior Springs is our flagship project and has recently completed a N.I. 43-101 Technical Report to support its listing on the Canadian Stock Exchange that details past work and drill programs and highlight future exploration plans to advance the Property.
 
We have not presently determined whether our mineral properties contain mineral reserves that are economically recoverable.
 
Our primary focus going forward will be to continue evaluating our properties, as well as possible acquisitions of additional mineral rights and exploration, all of which will require additional capital.
 
Conflicts of Interests
 
Magellan Gold Corporation (“Magellan”) is a publicly-held company under common control. Mr. Power is our President, CEO and a director and is a former officer and director of Magellan. John Gibbs is a significant shareholder of both Athena and Magellan.
 
Silver Saddle Resources, LLC (“Silver Saddle”) is a private company under common control. Mr. Power and Mr. Gibbs are significant investors and managing members of Silver Saddle.
 
Athena, Magellan and Silver Saddle are exploration stage companies, and each is involved in the business of acquisition and exploration of mineral resources.
 
The existence of common ownership and common management could result in significantly different operating results or financial position from those that could have resulted had Athena, Magellan and Silver Saddle been autonomous. In addition, the common ownership could result in significant conflicts of interest both in terms of the allocation of working capital as well as under the doctrine of corporate opportunity, inasmuch as all three entities are engaged in mineral exploration in the United States. Messrs. Power and Gibbs have not adopted any policy or guidelines to mitigate the potential adverse effects of their conflicting interests between and among, Athena, Magellan and Silver Saddle.
 
Investors in Athena should be cognizant that the interests of Athena may, in the future, be in conflict with the other activities of Athena’s control persons.
 
EXCELSIOR SPRINGS PROJECT
 
Excelsior Springs is Athena Gold’s flagship property, which is located in the southern portion of the Walker Lane. The Excelsior Springs project has been explored by a number of companies over the past 30 years. The target is a large tonnage, moderate grade gold deposit amenable to open pit mining. The Company was recently granted a drilling and exploration permit (the “Drill Permit”) by the BLM for up to 6 drill pads and 11 reverse circulation (“RC”) drill holes at the Excelsior Springs project in Esmeralda County, Nevada (the “Excelsior Springs Project”). A contractor has been engaged and a 5,000+ foot Reverse Circulation (“RC”) drilling program is expected to be completed by the end of March or early April 2022. In addition, Athena is considering an additional 9 RC drill holes on the patented claims under lease and Athena has posted the required reclamation bond with the BLM to secure the Drill Permit. Several of the permitted and/or planned holes will be scheduled for a Phase 2 of drilling subject to access to capital.

Location and Access:
 
The Excelsior Springs Property is located in the southeast part of unsurveyed Township 5 south, Range 39 and 40 east, MDBM, Esmeralda County, Nevada, approximately 45 miles southwest of Goldfield, Nevada. The Property is accessed by traveling 14.5 miles (23.2 km) south of Goldfield on US highway 95 and then turning west onto Nevada State Route 266 at Lida Junction and proceeding west for approximately 28.7 miles (45.9 km). Just past mile marker 12, a county-maintained gravel road turns north and leads five miles (8 km) to the Property. There is a locked gate at the southern edge of the patented claims. The Property lies on the moderately hilly south flank of the Palmetto Mountains at an elevation of 6,000 to 8,000 feet (1,829 – 2,439 m) with moderate to heavy juniper/pinion pine cover.
 
The Excelsior Springs Property comprises 140 unpatented mining claims and two patented mining claims. All of the claims are held by Nubian Resources USA (“Nubian”) and located on Federal Government land administered by the Department of Interior's Bureau of Land Management ("BLM"). The two patented claims are leased to Nubian by the owner, Christian Bramwell, of Pahrump, Nevada. The patented claims, the Prout and Fortunatus (MS 4106), were located in 1873 and 1892, respectively, and were patented in 1912. The patented claims have both surface and mineral rights. Ownership of the unpatented claims gives the right to explore for and develop mineral resources but no surface rights.
 
The Property consists of 42 "EX" and 88 "ES" contiguous, unpatented lode mining claims covering approximately 2,884 acres (1,167 hct) and two patented claims covering 40 acres (16.1 hct). A separate block of ten "ES" claims covering 202 acres (84 hct) is located approximately one mile (1.6 km) northwest of the main block of claims.
 
Legal Ownership
 
Nubian leased the two patented claims described above comprising part of the Excelsior Springs Property until 2023 under the following terms: Nubian must make pre-production royalty payments to the owner of $15,000 per year during exploration and $20,000 per year once commercial production begins. All payments are credited against a 2% Net Smelter Return Royalty on production. After 2022, Nubian must purchase the two patented claims for $300,000 in June 2023 or renegotiate the terms of the lease option.
 
Nubian Resources Ltd will retain a 1% Net Smelter Returns Royalty (the "NSR Royalty") on the Property . One-half (0.5%) of the NSR Royalty may be purchased by Athena for CAD $500,000 payable to Nubian. An additional one-half (0.5%) of the NSR Royalty may be purchased by Athena at fair market value.
 
History:
 
The Buster Mine claim block was discovered in 1872 and has been through several periods of small-scale mining and exploration efforts. During the late 1800s and perhaps the early 1900s there was unconfirmed production from the Buster Mine of an estimated 18,000 tons at 1.2 oz Au/ton (37.3 g/T). Little else is known about work on the mine until Fernand Lemieux re-timbered the Buster shaft in 1964 at a reported cost of $50,000 (Grant, 1986). A visual inspection of the shaft indicated the ladders were still in good condition. Since 1964, the Property has been explored by a number of companies as described below:

· | 1960s & 1970s – Efforts to re-timber the shafts and attempts at small scale mining
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | 1986 – Great Pacific Resources (11 RC holes) 
· | 1988 – Lucky Hardrock JV (12 RC holes) 
· | 2005-2007 – Walker Lane Gold (22 RC holes) 
· | 2008 – Evolving Gold (8 RC holes) 
· | 2011-2014 – Global Geoscience and partner Osisko Mining (31 RC holes & Geophysics)

Geology and Mineralization:
 
The project comprises 140 unpatented and two patented lode claims covering 2,884 acres (1,167 hct). The project has had some historic, high-grade gold production from silicified zones on the patented claims. These zones are contained in several, large, intensely altered, E-W-trending shear zones in Paleozoic siltstones and limestones. These shear zones host structurally and lithologically controlled gold mineralization within a 3 X 1 km area of intense clay alteration. The shear zones have been collectively named the Excelsior Springs Shear Zone, ESSZ, and form the core of the exploration targets on the property.
Geology and Mineralization. The Property lies within the Walker Lane, a regional-scale zone of northwest-trending, strike-slip faulting. The Walker Lane hosts a significant number of precious metal deposits including the Comstock Lode at Virginia City, Borealis, Aurora, Mineral Ridge, Paradise Peak, Rawhide, Tonopah, Goldfield and the Bullfrog District. These deposits are Tertiary in age, and all have a very strong structural control for the mineralization. However, the author has not verified information with respect to the abovementioned deposits, and information in this Report with respect to these deposits is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Excelsior Springs Property. The Excelsior Springs Property area contains a thick section of basal Precambrian-Cambrian sedimentary rocks that are complexly interlayered by thrust faults with the Ordovician Palmetto Formation. On the Property, there are a large number of prospect pits, small trenches and drill roads concentrated along the Excelsior Springs Property structural zone ("ESSZ"), a 1,000 foot-wide and 10,000 foot-long (304 m x 3,048 m), east-west-trending zone of shearing and alteration. Underground workings on the two patented claims have been the source of the Property's unverified, historic production, reported to be 19,200 oz Au (18,000 tons containing 1.2 oz Au/ton (37.3 g Au/T)). Assay results for the 84 RC holes that have been drilled on the Property show that 51 of the holes (61 %) contain a 20-foot interval averaging 0.25 g Au/T, typical cut-off grade for Nevada open-pit gold mines. Forty of the holes (48 %) contain a 20-foot interval averaging 0.5 g Au/T, and 24 of the holes (29 %) contain a 20-foot interval averaging 1.0 g Au/T.
Property Geology. The Excelsior Springs Property area contains basal Precambrian-Cambrian sedimentary rocks complexly interlayered by thrust faults with the Ordovician Palmetto Formation, as seen in Figure 17 (McKee, 1985). Lithologic units shown on the map are listed below.
Qa - Alluvium, (Quaternary) - sand and gravel.
 
Tq - Quartz porphyry and alaskite dikes, (Miocene) - Light-colored, quartz-rich fine- grained intrusive rocks.
 
Opa - Palmetto Formation, (Ordovician) - Heterogeneous mixture of dark, thin-bedded chert, shale, limestone and quartzites, usually in thrust fault contact with older rocks.
 
Ce - Emigrant Formation, (Cambrian) - Gray- green limey siltstone with sandstone interbeds. Grades upward into platy, gray, aphanitic limestone with chert nodules, chert beds and intraformational limestone conglomerates.

5
-

Ch - Harkless Formation, (Cambrian) - Interbedded fine-grained sandstone, siliceous siltstone and thin limestone.
 

Miocene rhyolite and hornblende diorite dikes (Tq) occur throughout the Property and are particularly abundant in the area east of the Excelsior Springs Property. Most of the dikes are aligned parallel to the east-west to east-northeast trends of the mineralization in the ESSZ. The quartz-rich rhyolite dikes appear to be more closely associated with alteration and gold mineralization than do the hornblende diorite dikes.
 
The 3,500 foot-thick (1,067 m), Cambrian-age (Ch) Harkless Formation seems to be the predominant host for the alteration and mineralization and is divided into a lower, greenish-gray quartz-rich siltstone member and an upper olive-gray siltstone member. Limestone layers, up to 100 feet-thick (30 m), occur in the lower member. The Cambrian-age (Ce) Emigrant Formation overlying the Harkless consists of a lower, multi-colored limestone-siltstone member, a middle, greenish-gray shale member and an upper, gray, cherty limestone member. The Emigrant Formation is about 1,300 feet-thick (396 m).

-

Mineralized Zones. The east-west trending ESSZ shows strong hydrothermal alteration over an area 1,000-1,800 feet-wide (305 – 549 m) and 10,000 feet-long (3,050 m) and appears to extend under Quaternary gravels to the west of the Buster and pit areas. In addition to the area around the Buster shaft, there are many other scattered zones of anomalous gold and base metal mineralization within the ESSZ. There are large, well developed, east-west-trending drainages to the north and south of the ESSZ. These drainages also contain outcrops of strongly altered rocks that have not been closely examined. Mineralization on the claims is hosted mostly in the Harkless Formation and the Emigrant Formation. Mineralization occurs almost entirely in shear zones which are characterized by brecciation, silicification and local mylonitization. The ESSZ contains well developed fractures striking east-west and well mineralized sets of north-, northeast- and northwest-striking fractures. There are several gold-bearing quartz veins containing galena and tetrahedrite in the shear zones that represent a post-deformation period of mineralization. Most of the mineralized zones do not contain visible sulfides.
 
Gold mineralization is localized by the structures and occurs as veinlets and veins. Gold also appears to occur in a disseminated form in favorable stratigraphic units. Brecciated quartz veins are common in the mineralized zones but frequently exhibit no direct correlation with higher gold values. Quartz-copper veins and pods of white quartz are also brecciated and locally re-cemented with fine-grained crystalline to chalcedonic silica. A strong correlation between visible copper and/ or zinc oxides and carbonates and higher-grade gold values has been noted. Cadmium and antimony values are anomalous but somewhat randomly distributed, and arsenic is strongly correlated with gold values greater than 8 ppm.
 
EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES:
 
Summary
 
Athena has begun an initial work program for the Excelsior Springs Property comprising the following:
 

· | Data compilation and review;
--+-----------------------------


· | Geologic mapping and sampling of selected areas of the project;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | Acquisition and evaluation of hyperspectral satellite imagery for alteration studies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Refining the project's structural model for mineralization;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | Developing a 3-D, computer generated model of the Buster area mineralization;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Creating a new set of 1:1200 scale cross sections to include all drill holes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(a) Data Compilation. There is a large amount of historic data generated by previous exploration programs on the Property. Much of the earlier data is incomplete and weakly documented but still useful. A new compilation of all the drilling results including collar location, hole azimuth, dip, total depth and gold values has been completed and used to construct the three-dimensional model and new cross sections.
 
(b) Geologic Mapping and Sampling. Approximately 20 man-days have been spent mapping in selected areas of the project. Mapping was done on detailed color photos at a scale of 1:2,400 with a particular focus on alteration zones and structural features. This new work is being integrated into the existing geologic map and will be fully digital. The new geologic map has not been completed, but it will serve as a base layer for showing alteration, mineralization, structures, geophysical data and drill hole projections. In conjunction with the mapping of selected areas, the Company has collected and processed 100 surface rock chip samples. Custody of these samples was maintained by the geologists and then delivered to American Assay Labs in Sparks, Nevada. All samples were fire assayed for gold, and an ICP process was used for other elements. The assay process is described in Section 11.1 of this Report and duplicate, standard and blank samples were used.

(c)       Hyperspectral Data. SpecTir Imagery of Reno, Nevada provided a suite of hyperspectral images covering the area around the project. The study shows the alteration mineralogy image generated by the SpecTIR data. The Buster zone clearly shows strong kaolinite and sodium-rich illite (paragonite) alteration. The strong clay alteration zone continues eastward to the Ridge zone (447300 E) and further east into the Excelsior Springs Property area (448000 E). Further east and west from the Buster zone the clay mineralogy becomes potassium-rich phengite along with muscovite.
 
(d)       Refining the Structural Model. Ore deposits found within the Walker Lane and particularly mineralized zones in the ESSZ are both structurally and lithologically controlled.
 
(e)       Three-Dimensional Model. Geo Vector Consultants in Ottawa, Canada has utilized the updated drill hole data base for the Property and has generated the 3-D model for the mineralized zones. There are multiple intercepts of potentially well mineralized material in many of the holes, but further infill drilling is needed to better confirm continuity of the zones between the holes.
 
(f)       Cross Sections. Mine Development Associates ("MDA"), a division of RESPEC Inc., consultants in Reno, is generating a complete set of 1:600 scale cross sections along with a topographic map showing all of the drill holes and mineralized intervals.
EXPLORATION PLANS
 
The Company was recently granted a drilling and exploration permit (the “Drill Permit”) by the BLM for up to 6 drill pads and 11 reverse circulation (“RC”) drill holes at the Excelsior Springs project in  Esmeralda County, Nevada. A contractor has been engaged and our Phase 1 drilling program of 5,000+ feet is expected to be completed by the end of March or early April 2022. In addition, Athena is considering an additional 9 RC drill holes on the patented claims under lease. Athena has posted the required reclamation bond with the BLM to secure the Drill Permit.
 
If Phase One is successful, future phases would be needed to precisely define depth, width, length, tonnage and value per ton of any deposit that has been identified and would involve:
 

· | drilling to develop the mining site; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | conducting metallurgical testing; and 
· | obtaining other pertinent technical information required to define an ore reserve and complete a feasibility study.

 
Depending upon the nature of the particular deposit, future exploration phases on the property could take one to five years or more and cost well in excess of $1 million.

PALMETTO PROJECT
 
Nubian Resources USA, Ltd. also holds several unpatented mining claims covering a prospect known as Palmetto located in the Railroad Springs Mining District in Esmeralda County, Nevada. The Company has no current plans to explore the prospect which for now will be held for investment.
No Proven or Probable Mineral Reserves/Exploration Stage Company
 
We are considered an exploration stage company under SEC criteria since we have not demonstrated the existence of proven or probable mineral reserves at any of our properties. In Industry Guide 7, the SEC defines a “reserve” as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Proven or probable mineral reserves are those reserves for which (a) quantity is computed and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling, and measurement are spaced so closely that the geologic character is defined and size, shape and depth of mineral content can be established (proven) or the sites are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced but high enough to assume continuity between observation points (probable). Mineral Reserves cannot be considered proven or probable unless and until they are supported by a feasibility study, indicating that the mineral reserves have had the requisite geologic, technical and economic work performed and are economically and legally extractable.
 
We anticipate further updating our mining properties disclosure in accordance with the SEC’s Final Rule 13-10570, Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants, which became effective March 30, 2019, and which rescinds SEC Industry Guide 7 following a two-year transition period, which means that we will be required to comply with the new rule no later than our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2021.
 
MARKETING
 
All of our mining operations, if successful, will produce gold in doré form or a concentrate that contains gold.
 
We plan to market our refined metal and doré to credit worthy bullion trading houses, market makers and members of the London Bullion Market Association, industrial companies and sound financial institutions. The refined metals will be sold to end users for use in electronic circuitry, jewelry, silverware, and the pharmaceutical and technology industries. Generally, the loss of a single bullion trading counterparty would not adversely affect us due to the liquidity of the markets and the availability of alternative trading counterparties.
 
We plan to refine and market its precious metals doré and concentrates using a geographically diverse group of third party smelters and refiners. The loss of any one smelting and refining client may have a material adverse effect if alternate smelters and refiners are not available. We believe there is sufficient global capacity available to address the loss of any one smelter.
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
General
 
Our activities are and will be subject to extensive federal, state and local laws governing the protection of the environment, prospecting, mine development, production, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such regulatory requirements are substantial and possible future legislation and regulations could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions and delays in the development and continued operation of our properties, the extent of which cannot be predicted. In the context of environmental permitting, including the approval of reclamation plans, we must comply with known standards and regulations which may entail significant costs and delays. Although we are committed to environmental responsibility and believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations, amendments to current laws and regulations, more stringent implementation of these laws and regulations through judicial review or administrative action or the adoption of new laws could have a materially adverse effect upon our results of operations.

Federal Environmental Laws
 
Certain mining wastes from extraction and beneficiation of ores are currently exempt from the extensive set of Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) regulations governing hazardous waste, although such wastes may be subject to regulation under state law as a solid or hazardous waste. The EPA has worked on a program to regulate these mining wastes pursuant to its solid waste management authority under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). Certain ore processing and other wastes are currently regulated as hazardous wastes by the EPA under RCRA. If our future mine wastes, if any, were treated as hazardous waste or such wastes resulted in operations being designated as a “Superfund” site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”) for cleanup, material expenditures would be required for the construction of additional waste disposal facilities or for other remediation expenditures. Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or an owner or operator at the time of its contamination generally may be held liable and may be forced to undertake remedial cleanup action or to pay for the government’s cleanup efforts. Such owner or operator may also be liable to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which may be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements may also be imposed upon our future tailings and waste disposal, if any, in Nevada under the Federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and state law counterparts. We have reviewed and considered current federal legislation relating to climate change and we do not believe it to have a material effect on our operations. Additional regulation or requirements under any of these laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect upon our results of operations.

Unpatented Mining Claims: The Mining Law of 1872
 
Except for the Langtry Property, our mineral rights consist of leases covering "unpatented" mining claims created and maintained in accordance with the U.S. General Mining Law of 1872, or the “General Mining Law.” Unpatented mining claims are unique U.S. property interests, and are generally considered to be subject to greater title risk than other real property interests because the validity of unpatented mining claims is often uncertain. The validity of an unpatented mining claim, in terms of both its location and its maintenance, is dependent on strict compliance with a complex body of federal and state statutory and decisional law that supplement the General Mining Law. Also, unpatented mining claims and related rights, including rights to use the surface, are subject to possible challenges by third parties or contests by the federal government. In addition, there are few public records that definitively control the issues of validity and ownership of unpatented mining claims. We have not filed a patent application for any of our unpatented mining claims that are located on federal public lands in the United States and, under possible future legislation to change the General Mining Law, patents may be difficult to obtain.
 
Location of mining claims under the General Mining Law, is a self-initiation system under which a person physically stakes an unpatented mining claim on public land that is open to location, posts a location notice and monuments the boundaries of the claim in compliance with federal laws and regulations and with state location laws, and files notice of that location in the county records and with the BLM. Mining claims can be located on land as to which the surface was patented into private ownership under the Stockraising Homestead Act of 1916, 43 U.S.C. §299, but the mining claimant cannot injure, damage or destroy the surface owner's permanent improvements and must pay for damage to crops caused by prospecting. Discovery of a valuable mineral deposit, as defined under federal law, is essential to the validity of an unpatented mining claim and is required on each mining claim individually. The location is made as a lode claim for mineral deposits found as veins or rock in place, or as a placer claim for other deposits. While the maximum size and shape of lode claims and placer claims are established by statute, there are no limits on the number of claims one person may locate or own. The General Mining Law also contains provision for acquiring five-acre claims of non-mineral land for millsite purposes. A mining operation typically is comprised of many mining claims.
 
The holder of a valid unpatented mining claim has possessory title to the land covered thereby, which gives the claimant exclusive possession of the surface for mining purposes and the right to mine and remove minerals from the claim. Legal title to land encompassed by an unpatented mining claim remains in the United States, and the government can contest the validity of a mining claim. The General Mining Law requires the performance of annual assessment work for each claim, and subsequent to enactment of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. §1201 et seq., mining claims are invalidated if evidence of assessment work is not timely filed with BLM. However, in 1993 Congress enacted a provision requiring payment of $140 per year claim maintenance fee in lieu of performing assessment work, subject to an exception for small miners having less than 10 claims. No royalty is paid to the United States with respect to minerals mined and sold from a mining claim.
 
The General Mining Law provides a procedure for a qualified claimant to obtain a mineral patent (i.e., fee simple title to the mining claim) under certain conditions. It has become much more difficult in recent years to obtain a patent. Beginning in 1994, Congress imposed a funding moratorium on the processing of mineral patent applications which had not reached a designated stage in the patent process at the time the moratorium went into effect. Additionally, Congress has considered several bills in recent years to repeal the General Mining Law or to amend it to provide for the payment of royalties to the United States and to eliminate or substantially limit the patent provisions of the law.
 
Mining claims are conveyed by deed, or leased by the claimant to the party seeking to develop the property. Such a deed or lease (or memorandum of it) needs to be recorded in the real property records of the county where the property is located, and evidence of such transfer needs to be filed with BLM. It is not unusual for the grantor or lessor to reserve a royalty, which as to precious metals often is expressed as a percentage of net smelter returns.
 
Patented Mining Claims
 
Patented mining claims, such as the two patented claims included in the Excelsior Springs project, are mining claims on federal lands that are held in fee simple by the owner. No maintenance fees or royalties are payable to the BLM; however, lease payments and royalties are payable under the operative leases.

GOLD PRICES
 
Our operating results are substantially dependent upon the world market prices of silver. We have no control over gold prices, which can fluctuate widely. The volatility of such prices is illustrated by the following table, which sets forth the high and low London Fix prices of gold (as reported by www.kitco.com) per ounce during the periods indicated:
 


Year | High | | Low 
-----+------+---+------
2017 | | $ | 1,346 | $ | 1,151
2018 | | $ | 1,355 | $ | 1,178
2019 | | $ | 1,546 | $ | 1,270
2020 | | $ | 2,067 | $ | 1,474
2021 | | $ | 1,943 | $ | 1,684

 
These historical prices are not indicative of future gold prices.
