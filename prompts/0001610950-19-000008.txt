Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a leading global biopharmaceutical solutions organization providing a full suite of clinical and commercial services to customers in the biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries. We offer both stand-alone and integrated biopharmaceutical product development solutions through our Contract Research Organization (“CRO”) and Contract Commercial Organization (“CCO”), ranging from Early Phase (Phase I) clinical trials to the full commercialization of biopharmaceutical products, with the goal of increasing the likelihood of regulatory approval and commercial success for our customers. 
Our operations are divided into two reportable segments, Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions, to reflect the structure under which we operate, evaluate our performance, make strategic decisions, and allocate resources. We integrate our clinical and commercial capabilities into customized solutions by sharing knowledge, data, and insights through our biopharmaceutical acceleration model ("BAM"). This collaboration across the development and commercialization continuum facilitates unique insights into patient populations, therapeutic environments, product timelines, and the competitive landscape.
Founded more than three decades ago as an academic organization dedicated to central nervous system ("CNS") research, we have translated that expertise into a global organization with deep therapeutic specialties, as well as full data services and regulatory advisory and implementation support capabilities. Over the past decade, we have built our scale and capabilities to become a leading global provider of Phase I to Phase IV clinical development services, as well as a full range of commercialization and other complementary services. We were established as INC Research in 1998, and our corporate headquarters are located in Morrisville, North Carolina. INC Research Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in August 2010. We changed our name to Syneos Health, Inc. after our 2017 merger with inVentiv Health (the "Merger").

Our Market
The market for our solutions is primarily the biopharmaceutical industry that utilizes outsourced clinical drug and medical device development and commercialization services. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the following market trends:
Trends in clinical drug and medical device development.  Biopharmaceutical companies continue to prioritize the outsourcing of Phase I to Phase IV clinical trials, particularly in complex, high-growth therapeutic areas such as oncology. Additionally, small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies typically have limited infrastructure and therefore are more likely to outsource their clinical development to CROs. With increased funding, emerging biotechnology companies, which typically lack resources and infrastructure to conduct clinical trials, are a high growth segment for the CRO market. Within the overall Phase I to Phase IV clinical trial market, the Phase IV/post-approval/Real World Evidence sub-market represents an increasing area of spending. These pharmaceutical industry trends are increasing demand for outsourced research and development services from CROs. 
We estimate that, based on industry sources and management estimates, the market for CRO services for Phase I to Phase IV clinical development activities will grow at a compound average annual rate of 6% through 2021, driven by a combination of increased development spending and further outsourcing. We estimate the total addressable clinical development market to be approximately $54.0 billion, of which $26.0 billion was outsourced to CROs in 2018. 
Trends in commercialization outsourcing.  We believe that, based on industry sources and management estimates, the market for CCO services will increase at a compound average growth rate of approximately 6% per annum through 2021. We believe this potential growth is supported by: (i) significant biopharmaceutical sales and marketing budgets; (ii) a continuing shift toward specialty and more complex therapies requiring more complex and integrated sales and marketing execution; (iii) a robust funding environment, which provides capital to fuel development and commercialization spending, particularly for small to mid-sized companies; (iv) continued political scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, which is intensifying pressure for our customers to further reduce fixed costs by outsourcing; and (v) an evolving industry landscape illustrated by a shift to longer and more strategic relationships.
Increasingly challenging clinical development and commercialization environment. The biopharmaceutical industry is currently facing a number of challenges, including: (i) margin deterioration; (ii) reimbursement and provider access hurdles; (iii) fewer blockbuster and high profitability drugs; (iv) continued pressure from generic brand exposure; and (v) the consolidation of payers, healthcare systems, providers, and pharmacies. These challenges also make it more complicated to engage physicians and patients, making new product launches more difficult. At the same time, the industry is experiencing growing demand for specialty drugs, pressure to improve research and development ("R&D") productivity, the transition of the healthcare industry worldwide from a volume-based to a value-based reimbursement structure, and growing political and pricing pressures. Existing approaches to address these challenges include reducing overhead costs, optimizing the deployment of marketing and field assets, and refocusing product portfolios around therapeutic areas with depth of presence and expanded market access capabilities. 
Optimization of biopharmaceutical R&D efficiency.  Market forces and healthcare reform, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, the 21st Century Cures Act, and other governmental initiatives, place significant pressure on biopharmaceutical companies to improve cost efficiency. At the same time, the complexity, size, duration, and globalization of clinical trials has increased drug development costs. In an effort to reduce these rising costs, biopharmaceutical companies need to demonstrate a new therapy’s relative improvement in quality, safety, and effectiveness compared to the current standard of care as early as possible in the development process. Outsourcing to CROs allows biopharmaceutical companies to deploy capital more efficiently, quickly benefiting from CROs’ existing infrastructure and therapeutic expertise without having to continuously scale in-house development resources. 
Globalization of clinical trials.  Clinical trials have become increasingly global as biopharmaceutical companies seek to accelerate patient recruitment, particularly within protocol-eligible, treatment-naïve patient 
3

populations without co-morbidities that could skew clinical outcomes. Biopharmaceutical companies are also increasingly seeking to expand the commercial potential of their products by applying for regulatory approvals in multiple countries, including fast-growing economies that are spending more on healthcare. As part of the biopharmaceutical approval process in newer markets, especially in certain Asian and emerging markets, regulators now often require clinical trials to include specific percentages or numbers of people from local populations, resulting in a combination of multinational and domestic clinical trials. 
Management of increasingly complex clinical trials.  The biopharmaceutical industry operates in an increasingly sophisticated and highly-regulated environment and has responded to the demands of novel therapeutics by adapting efficient drug development processes. Complex clinical trial design expertise has emerged as a significant competitive advantage for select CROs that have a track record of successfully navigating country-specific regulatory, clinical trial protocol, and patient enrollment barriers, including sometimes subjective, evolving clinical endpoints. In addition, the therapeutic areas where we have significant experience and expertise, including CNS, oncology, and other complex diseases, often require more complicated protocols than other disease indications. Many of these studies have longer durations due to these factors, resulting in demand for greater clinical trial proficiency and expertise in these therapeutic areas, particularly in light of new methods such as the use of biomarkers and gene therapy. 
Evolving commercialization outsourcing needs for large versus small to mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies.  The needs of large versus small to mid-sized customers are evolving differently based upon their distinct infrastructure and corporate commercialization goals. Large biopharmaceutical companies tend to have robust internal resources and generally are seeking to augment these resources with individual outsourced services on a brand-by-brand basis. Frequently, they are also looking to establish enterprise vendor relationships with volume considerations to support broader cost savings initiatives. Conversely, small to mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies typically have limited product portfolios with fewer internal resources and less commercialization experience. As a result, these companies generally require the full spectrum of commercialization capabilities. Historically, their only viable commercialization option was to enter into licensing agreements or a divestiture, which often meant surrendering a significant portion of an asset's long-term economic value. However, with today’s funding environment driving sufficient capital for product launch, we believe these companies may be more receptive to commercialization alternatives that allow them to maintain their independence.
Our Competitive Strengths
Our key competitive strengths are:
Differentiated positioning through our full suite of clinical and commercial services. We believe our customers are facing an increasingly complex and evolving market where regulatory approval no longer guarantees a successful product launch. To address this modern market reality, we believe clinical development and commercial disciplines must work together to accelerate the delivery of differentiated therapies to the market that meet the needs of patients, health care professionals, and payers. As the only company with in-house capabilities to provide a full suite of integrated clinical drug development and commercial solutions, we believe we are well-positioned to successfully navigate this increasingly complex and evolving market for our customers.
Global leadership and experience in biopharmaceutical outsourcing. We believe our scale, global reach, and breadth of services, coupled with our deep industry expertise and experience, are critical to our customers who are seeking to consolidate their outsourcing to a smaller set of large global providers. We offer our services through a highly skilled staff of approximately 24,000 employees located in approximately 60 countries as of December 31, 2018, and have conducted work in more than 110 countries.

Bring differentiated solutions to the market and increase cross-selling opportunities. We believe we are uniquely positioned to address our customers’ evolving needs as the only fully integrated provider of a full suite of services across the product development continuum. Our breadth of services enables us to provide customized solutions designed to successfully accelerate the time to market for our customers’ clinical or commercial projects. We believe sharing commercial insights during the early phases of clinical trials can lead to better informed decisions around clinical trial design and strategies. Similarly, we believe our therapeutic and clinical trial expertise can lead to improved decisions about regulatory and payer approvals, market access, reimbursement and formulary inclusion, and other steps that are critical to the commercial success of our customers.
We believe that we have substantial opportunities to expand the reach of services that we provide to our existing customers. During 2018, 97 customers, of which 55 were also in our top 100 customers, utilized services from both our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments, demonstrating that there is both market precedent and significant potential to sell additional services to our customer base. Given our past success in expanding the scope of services provided to current customers, we intend to further expand our business with our existing customers by cross-selling additional clinical and commercial services.

We have developed a global platform with a presence in all of the major biopharmaceutical markets and intend to further expand our business outside of the United States, targeting regions where we are underpenetrated and that offer significant growth opportunities. We have expanded our capabilities, existing relationships, and local regulatory knowledge, which we believe will continue to position us well for new customer wins in a wide array of markets. We have added geographic reach through both acquisitions and organic growth in areas such as Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, and Europe, which we believe is critical to obtaining business awards from large and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies. We may also selectively identify and acquire complementary businesses to enhance our services, capabilities, and geographic presence.
Capitalize on industry trends favoring outsourcing. Our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments are benefiting from specific industry trends that are expected to drive attractive growth rates. Global demand for biopharmaceutical products continues to increase, driven by expanding access to healthcare, increasing life expectancy, and the growing prevalence of chronic conditions in both developed and emerging markets. However, higher costs and increased complexity are driving our customers to seek efficiency and expertise through outsourcing services. We believe outsourcing late stage clinical development services to CROs optimizes returns on invested R&D for biopharmaceutical companies. As business models continue to evolve in the healthcare sector, we believe that the rate of commercial outsourcing may follow a similar long-term path as that of the clinical development market. 
Drive acceleration of commercial outsourcing with our Syneos OneTM offering. We believe regulatory approval is only the first step towards a successful outcome, as our customers cannot earn a positive economic return for their asset until they achieve significant adoption in the commercial marketplace. We believe our Syneos One™ offering is uniquely positioned to determine the appropriate mix of clinical and commercial solutions to help customers optimize the development process of their products and maximize the return on their investment. In addition, Syneos One™ enables multiple selling points along the operational timeline of product development. The need for a full suite of product development services is particularly strong with our small to mid-sized customers in the near-term, given their increased access to funding to bring a product to the market coupled with their limited internal resources. Large biopharmaceutical companies may represent a long-term opportunity if market pressures to reduce fixed-cost infrastructures further intensify. Given our strong relationships in both customer segments and our breadth of services, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the needs of both customer types.

Customers
We have a well-diversified customer base of over 600 customers that includes nearly all of the world's largest biopharmaceutical companies, which we define as the top 50 biopharmaceutical companies measured by annual R&D spend, as well as numerous emerging and specialty biotechnology companies, medical device and diagnostics companies. We are diversified across our segments, deriving 73% and 27% of our service revenue during 2018 from our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments, respectively. 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, our revenue attributable to large biopharmaceutical companies represented approximately 60% of our total service revenue and service revenue attributable to small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies represented approximately 40%. Additionally, we serve customers in a variety of locations throughout the world, with approximately 68% of our 2018 service revenue generated from customers in the United States and Canada; 22% generated from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa; 9% generated from Asia-Pacific; and 2% generated from Latin America. This diversification allows us to grow our business in multiple customer segments and geographies. 
14

Our top five customers accounted for approximately 24% of our revenue in 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, one customer accounted for approximately 11% of our service revenue which was primarily in our Clinical Solutions segment. Further, among the majority of our customers, revenue is diversified by multiple projects and services. For example, during 2018, we provided both clinical and commercial services to 97 customers. We believe that the tenure of our customer relationships as well as the depth of penetration of our services reflects our strong reputation and track record. We believe we are uniquely positioned to further penetrate our existing customer base and expand our services across the biopharmaceutical industry, as a significant number of the top 50 biopharmaceutical companies utilize both clinical and commercial services. 
New Business Awards and Backlog
We add new business awards to backlog when we enter into a contract or when we receive a written commitment from the customer selecting us as a service provider, provided that:

• | the customer has received appropriate internal funding approval and collection of the award value is probable;


• | the project or projects are not contingent upon completion of another clinical trial or event;


• | the project or projects are expected to commence within a certain period of time from the end of the quarter in which the award was granted;


• | the customer has entered or intends to enter into a comprehensive contract as soon as practicable; and


• | for awards related to our FSP offering a maximum of twelve months of services are included in the award value.

In addition, we continually evaluate our backlog to determine if any of the previously awarded work is no longer expected to be performed, regardless of whether we have received formal cancellation notice from the customer. If we determine that any previously awarded work is no longer probable of being performed, we remove the value from our backlog based on the risk of cancellation. We recognize revenue from these awards as services are performed, provided we have entered into a contractual commitment with the customer. 
Beginning on January 1, 2018 we adopted ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and as a result, we no longer present service revenue and revenue associated with reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses separately in our consolidated statements of operations. Reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses can fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the timing of program initiation or closeout and the mix of program complexity, and therefore the anticipated timing of such expenses and the associated impact of ASC 606 on revenue can be difficult to predict. As a result, we have not adjusted our backlog or net new business awards information included below to incorporate revenue associated with reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses and have instead presented these metrics as if the previous accounting guidance (ASC 605) had been in effect.
Our backlog consists of anticipated future revenue from business awards that have not started but are anticipated to begin in the future (as discussed above), or that are in process and have not been completed. Our backlog also reflects any cancellation or adjustment activity related to these contracts. The average duration of our contracts will fluctuate from period to period in the future based on the contracts comprising our backlog at any given time. The majority of our contracts can be terminated by the customer with a 30-day notice. 
We currently report new business awards for our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments and backlog from our Clinical Solutions segment and the selling solutions service offering within our Commercial Solutions segment. We do not currently report backlog data for the remaining service offerings in the Commercial Solutions segment. Prior to 2018, we only reported backlog and net new business awards for the Clinical Solutions segment. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our new business awards, net of award cancellations, were $3.89 billion, $1.82 billion, and $1.22 billion, respectively. 
15

Additionally, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our backlog was $4.86 billion and $3.80 billion, respectively. We expect approximately $2.49 billion of our backlog at December 31, 2018 will be recognized as revenue in 2019, with the remainder expected to be recorded as revenue beyond 2019. 
We believe that our backlog and net new business awards might not be consistent indicators of future revenue because they have been, and likely will be, affected by a number of factors, including the variable size and duration of projects, many of which are performed over several years, and cancellations and changes to the scope of work during the course of projects. Additionally, projects may be canceled or delayed by the customer or regulatory authorities. We generally do not have a contractual right to the full amount of the awards reflected in our backlog. If a customer cancels an award, we might be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred. As we increasingly compete for and enter into large contracts that are more global in nature, we expect the duration of projects and the period over which related revenue is recognized to lengthen, and therefore expect the rate at which our backlog and net new business awards convert into revenue to decrease. In addition, our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard during 2018 may result in delays in revenue recognition compared to prior periods. See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Our backlog might not be indicative of our future revenues, and we might not realize all of the anticipated future revenue reflected in our backlog," and Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - New Business Awards and Backlog" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.

Competition
We operate in a number of highly competitive markets. Our competitors include a variety of companies providing services to the biopharmaceutical industry, including large CROs and smaller specialty CROs, large global communications holding companies, smaller specialized communications agencies, contract sales organizations, and a wide range of consulting companies. Each of our reportable segments faces distinct competitors within the markets they serve. Notwithstanding competitive factors, we believe that our deep therapeutic expertise, global reach, integrated model, and operational strengths differentiate us from our competitors across both of our segments.
Clinical Solutions
Our Clinical Solutions segment competes primarily against other full-service CROs and services provided by in-house R&D departments of biopharmaceutical companies, universities and teaching hospitals.

Government Regulation
The biopharmaceutical industry is subject to a high degree of governmental regulation in both domestic and international markets. Regardless of the country or region in which approval is being sought, before a marketing application for a drug is ready for submission to regulatory authorities, the candidate drug must undergo rigorous testing in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The clinical trial process must be conducted in accordance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in the United States and similar laws and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations require the drug to be tested and studied in certain ways prior to submission for approval. 
Regulation of Our Clinical Solutions Segment 
In the United States, the FDA regulates the conduct of clinical trials of drug products in human subjects, and the form and content of regulatory applications. The FDA also regulates the development, approval, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, import, export, distribution, advertising, sale, and marketing of drug products. The FDA has similar authority and similar requirements with respect to the clinical testing of biological products and medical devices. In the EU and other jurisdictions where our customers intend to apply for marketing authorization, similar laws and regulations apply. Within the EU, these requirements are enforced by the EMA, and requirements vary slightly from one member state to another. In Canada, clinical trials are regulated by the Health Products Food Branch of Health Canada as well as provincial regulations. Similar requirements also apply in other jurisdictions, including Australia, Japan, and other Asian countries, where we operate or where our customers intend to apply for marketing authorization. Sponsors of clinical trials also follow the ICH GCP guidelines. An addendum to the ICH GCP guidelines was adopted by the ICH committee in November 2016 and will now be implemented through national and regional guidance in ICH member states. The changes aim to encourage sponsors to implement improved oversight and management of clinical trials, utilizing a Quality Risk Management approach while continuing to ensure protection of human subjects participating in trials and clinical trial data integrity.
Our services are subject to various regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the clinical trial process. In the United States, we must perform our clinical development services in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, including GCP, which govern, among other things, the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials. Before a human clinical trial may begin, the manufacturer or sponsor of the investigational drug or biologic must file an investigational new drug application ("IND") with the FDA, which contains, among other things, the results of pre-clinical tests, manufacturing information, and other analytical data. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Each clinical trial conducted in the United States must be conducted pursuant to, and in accordance with, an effective IND. In addition, under GCP regulations, each human clinical trial we conduct is subject to the oversight of an independent institutional review board ("IRB") which is an independent committee that has the regulatory authority to review, approve and monitor a clinical trial. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the study subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Clinical trials conducted outside the United States are subject to the laws and regulations of the country where the trials are conducted. These laws and regulations might not be similar to the laws and regulations administered by the FDA and other laws and regulations regarding the protection of patient safety and privacy and the control of study pharmaceuticals, medical devices or other study materials. Studies conducted outside the United States can also be subject to regulation by the FDA if the studies are conducted pursuant to an IND, or in the case of a device, an investigational device exemption. It is the responsibility of the study sponsor or the parties conducting the studies to ensure that all applicable legal and regulatory requirements are fulfilled.
In order to comply with GCP and other regulations, we must, among other things:

• | comply with specific requirements governing the selection of qualified principal investigators and clinical research sites;


• | obtain specific written commitments from principal investigators;

18


• | obtain review, approval, and supervision of the clinical trials by an IRB or ethics committee;


• | obtain favorable opinion from regulatory agencies to commence a clinical trial;


• | verify that appropriate patient informed consents are obtained before the patient participates in a clinical trial;


• | ensure that adverse drug reactions resulting from the administration of a drug or biologic during a clinical trial are medically evaluated and reported in a timely manner;


• | monitor the validity and accuracy of data;


• | monitor drug, biologic or device accountability at clinical research sites; and


• | verify that principal investigators and study staff maintain records and reports and permit appropriate governmental authorities access to data for review.

Similar guidelines exist in various states and in other countries. We may be subject to regulatory action if we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations. Failure to comply with certain regulations can also result in the termination of ongoing research and disqualification of data collected during the clinical trials. For example, violations of GCP could result, depending on the nature of the violation and the type of product involved, in the issuance of a warning letter, suspension or termination of a clinical study, refusal of the FDA to approve clinical trial or marketing applications or withdrawal of such applications, injunction, seizure of investigational products, civil penalties, criminal prosecutions, or debarment from assisting in the submission of new drug applications. See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements, regulatory requirements, and ethical considerations, we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be harmed".
We monitor our clinical trials to test for compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the United States and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have adopted standard operating procedures that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements and serve as a mechanism for controlling and enhancing the quality of our clinical trials. In the United States, our procedures were developed to ensure compliance with GCP and associated guidelines.
In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers might be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis virus. Furthermore, certain employees might have to receive initial and periodic training to ensure compliance with applicable hazardous materials regulations and health and safety guidelines. We are subject to similar regulations in Canada and Spain.
Regulation of Our Commercial Solutions Segment
Our field personnel are subject to all laws, rules and regulations governing the promotion of pharmaceutical products in the United States and in every other country where such personnel perform work. In particular, these rules and regulations include limitations on the indications for which a product may be promoted and on promotional spending. Additionally these laws, rules and regulations govern the manner in which the product may be promoted and the scientific exchange of information related to the product. Violations of these rules may leave us at risk of direct regulatory enforcement action and/or cause us to be in breach of contract with our customers. 
Some of our field personnel handle and distribute samples of pharmaceutical products. In the United States, the handling and distribution of prescription drug product samples are subject to regulation under the Prescription Drug Marketing Act and other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations and other countries may have similar laws or regulations. These laws and regulations regulate the distribution of drug samples by mandating procedures for storage and record-keeping requirements for drug samples and ban the purchase or sale of drug samples. Further, we must comply with the requirements of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which regulates the distribution, record-keeping, handling, security, and disposal of controlled substances. 
19

Our communications solutions offerings are subject to all regulatory risks applicable to similar communications businesses as well as risks that relate specifically to the provision of these services to the biopharmaceutical industry. Such regulatory risks include enforcement by the FDA, Health Canada, the Department of Health in the United Kingdom, EMA and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as state agencies and other foreign regulators enforcing laws relating to product advertising, false advertising, and unfair and deceptive trade practices. In addition to enforcement actions initiated by government agencies, there has been an increasing tendency in the United States among biopharmaceutical companies to resort to the courts and industry and self-regulatory bodies to challenge comparative prescription drug advertising on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive. There continues to be an expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures, and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products.
Regulation of Patient Information
The confidentiality of patient-specific information and records and the circumstances under which such patient-specific information and records may be released for inclusion in our databases or used in other aspects of our business are heavily regulated. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has promulgated rules under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act in connection with the application of security and privacy provisions under the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (collectively, "HIPAA"). These regulations govern the use, handling and disclosure of personally identifiable medical information and require the use of standard transactions, privacy and security standards and other administrative simplification provisions by covered entities, which include many healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses. Although we do not consider that our business activities generally cause us to be subject to HIPAA as a directly covered entity, we endeavor to embrace sound identity protection practices. These regulations also establish procedures for the exercise of an individual's rights and the methods permissible for de-identification of health information. We are also subject to privacy legislation in Canada under the federal Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act, the Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector and the Personal Health Information Protection Act, and privacy legislation in the EU under the General Data Protection Regulation. 
Intellectual Property
We develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies, and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure agreements, and other contractual arrangements to protect our trade secrets, and copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights. We have obtained or applied for trademarks and copyright protection in the United States and in a number of foreign countries. Our material trademarks include Trusted Process®, PlanActivation®, QuickStart®, ProgramAccelerate®, QualityFinish®, "Shortening the distance from lab to life®, Syneos Health, Inc., and other corporate emblems. Although the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country, trademarks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and so long as they have not been found to have become generic. Although we believe that the ownership of trademarks is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, we rely primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of our employees. We do not have any material patents, licenses, franchises, or concessions.
20

Employees
The level of competition among employers in the United States and overseas for skilled personnel is high. We believe that our brand recognition and our multinational presence are advantages in attracting qualified candidates. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 24,000 employees worldwide, with approximately 56% located in the United States and Canada, 23% in Europe, 17% in Asia-Pacific, 3% in Latin America, and 1% in the Middle East and Africa. The majority of our employees are employed on a full-time basis. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe our overall relations with our employees are good. Employees in certain of our non-U.S. locations are represented by workers' councils as required by local laws. 
Indemnification and Insurance 
In conjunction with our Clinical Solutions services, we employ or contract with research institutions and, in some jurisdictions, principal investigators and pharmacies on behalf of biopharmaceutical companies to serve as research centers and principal investigators in conducting clinical trials to test new drugs on human volunteers. Such testing creates the risk of liability for personal injury or death of volunteers, particularly to volunteers with life-threatening illnesses, resulting from adverse reactions to the drugs administered. It is possible that we could be held liable for claims and expenses arising from any professional malpractice of the principal investigators with whom we contract or engage, or in the event of personal injury to or death of persons participating in clinical trials. In addition, as a result of our operation of Phase I clinical trial facilities, we could be liable for the general risks associated with clinical trials including, but not limited to, adverse events resulting from the administration of drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of medical care providers. We also could be held liable for errors or omissions in connection with the services we perform through each of our service groups. For example, we could be held liable for errors, omissions, or breach of contract, if monitoring obligations have been transferred to us and one of our CRA's inaccurately reports from source documents or fails to adequately monitor a human clinical trial resulting in inaccurately recorded results.
We have sought to reduce our risks by implementing the following where practicable:

• | securing contractual assurances such as indemnification provisions and provisions seeking to limit or exclude liability contained in our contracts with customers, institutions, pharmacies, vendors and principal investigators;


• | securing contractual and other assurances that adequate insurance will be maintained to the extent applicable by customers, institutions, pharmacies, vendors, principal investigators and us; and


• | complying with various regulatory requirements, including monitoring that the oversight of independent review boards and ethics committees are intact where obligations are transferred to us and monitoring the oversight of the procurement by the principal investigator of each participant's informed consent to participate in the study.

Our contractual indemnifications generally do not fully protect us against certain of our own actions, such as negligence. Contractual arrangements are subject to negotiation with customers, and the terms and scope of any indemnification, limitation of liability or exclusion of liability varies from customer to customer and from clinical trial to clinical trial. Additionally, financial performance of these indemnities is not secured. Therefore, we bear the risk that any indemnifying party against which we have claims may not have the financial ability to fulfill its indemnification obligations to us.
While we maintain a global insurance program including professional liability and other types of insurance standard to our industry to cover our liability while conducting our business activities and contracted services, including drug safety issues as well as data processing and other errors and omissions, it is possible that we could become subject to claims not covered by insurance or that exceed our coverage limits. We could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is outside the scope of, or in excess of, a contractual indemnification provision, beyond the level of insurance coverage or not covered by insurance, or in the event that an indemnifying party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations.
