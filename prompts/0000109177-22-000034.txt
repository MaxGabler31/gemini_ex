General Overview
We are a diversified global branded consumer products and home essentials company.  We manage the business in three vertically integrated, product focused segments: (i) Home and Personal Care (“HPC”), (ii) Global Pet Care (“GPC”), and (iii) Home and Garden (“H&G”).  The Company manufactures, markets and distributes its products globally in the North America (“NA”), Europe, Middle East & Africa (“EMEA”), Latin America (“LATAM”) and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) regions through a variety of trade channels, including retailers, wholesalers and distributors. We enjoy strong name recognition under our various brands and patented technologies across multiple product categories. Global and geographic strategic initiatives and financial objectives are determined at the corporate level. Each segment is responsible for implementing defined strategic initiatives and achieving certain financial objectives and has a president responsible for sales and marketing initiatives and the financial results for all product lines within that segment. The segments are supported through center-led shared service enabling functions consisting of finance and accounting, information technology, legal and human resources, supply chain and commercial operations. The following is an overview of the consolidated business showing net sales by segment and geographic region sold (based upon destination) as a percentage of consolidated net sales for the year ended September 30, 2022.
Our operating performance is influenced by a number of factors including: general economic conditions; foreign exchange fluctuations; trends in consumer markets; consumer confidence and preferences; our overall product line mix, including pricing and gross margin, which vary by product line and geographic market; pricing of certain raw materials and commodities; energy and fuel prices; and our general competitive position, especially as impacted by our competitors’ advertising and promotional activities and pricing strategies. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in Item 7 to this Annual Report, for further discussion of the consolidated operating results and segment operating results.

Home and Personal Care (HPC)
The following is an overview of net sales by product category and geographic region sold by destination for the year ended September 30, 2022.

Product Category | Products | Brands 
Home Appliances | Small kitchen appliances including toaster ovens, coffeemakers, slow cookers, air fryers, blenders, hand mixers, grills, food processors, juicers, toasters, irons, kettles, and bread makers, cookware, and cookbooks. | Black & Decker®, Russell Hobbs®, George Foreman®, PowerXL®, Emeril Legasse®, Copper Chef ®, Toastmaster®, Juiceman®, Farberware®, and Breadman®
Personal Care | Hair dryers, flat irons and straighteners, rotary and foil electric shavers, personal groomers, mustache and beard trimmers, body groomers, nose and ear trimmers, women's shavers, and haircut kits. | Remington® 

We have a trademark license agreement (the "License Agreement") with Stanley Black & Decker ("SBD") pursuant to which we license the Black & Decker® brand ("B&D") in North America, Latin America (excluding Brazil) and the Caribbean for four core categories of household appliances: beverage products, food preparation products, garment care products and cooking products. The License Agreement has a term ending June 30, 2025, including a sell-off period from April 1, 2025 to June 30, 2025 whereby the Company can continue to sell and distribute but no longer produce products subject to the License Agreement. Under the terms of the License Agreement, we agree to pay SBD royalties based on a percentage of sales, with minimum annual royalty payments of $15.0 million, with the exception that the minimum annual royalty will no longer be applied effective January 1, 2024 through the expiration of the License Agreement. The License Agreement also requires us to comply with maximum annual return rates for products. Subsequent to the completion of the License Agreement, there are no continuing obligations or restrictions on the business activities of either party. See Note 6 – Revenue Recognition included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further detail on revenue concentration from B&D products.
We own the right to use the Remington® trademark for electric shavers, shaver accessories, grooming products and personal care products; and Remington Arms Company, Inc. (“Remington Arms”) owns the rights to use the trademark for firearms, sporting goods and products for industrial use, including industrial hand tools. The terms of a 1986 agreement between Remington Products, LLC and Remington Arms provides for the shared rights to use the trademark on products which are not considered “principal products of interest” for either company. We retain the trademark for nearly all products which we believe can benefit from the use of the brand name in our distribution channels. 
On February 18, 2022, the Company acquired the home appliances and cookware products sold under the PowerXL®, Emeril Legasse®, and Copper Chef® brands from Tristar Products, Inc. (the "Tristar Business"). The net assets and operations of the Tristar Business are integrated within the HPC segment. As part of the acquisition, the PowerXL® and Copper Chef® brands were acquired outright by the Company while the Emeril Legasse® brand remains subject to a trademark license agreement with the license holder (the "Emeril License"). Pursuant to the Emeril License, the HPC segment will continue to license the Emeril brands within the US, Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom for certain designated product categories of household appliances, including small kitchen food preparation products, indoor and outdoor grills and grill accessories, and cookbooks. The Emeril License is set to expire effective December 31, 2022 with options of up to three one-year renewal periods following the initial expiration. Under the terms of the agreement, we are obligated to pay the license holder a percentage of sales, with minimum annual royalty payments of $1.5 million, increasing to $1.8 million in subsequent renewal periods. See Note 4 – Acquisitions included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further detail.
HPC products are sold primarily to large retailers, online retailers, wholesalers, distributors, warehouse clubs, food and drug chains and specialty trade or retail outlets such as consumer electronics stores, department stores, discounters and other specialty stores. International distribution varies by region and is often executed on a country-by-country basis. Our sales generally are made through the use of individual purchase orders. A significant percentage of our sales are attributable to a limited group of retailer customers, including Walmart and Amazon, which represent approximately 35% of segment sales for the year ended September 30, 2022. With the acquisition of the Tristar Business, we have expanded our distribution channels with more direct-to-consumer capabilities which we anticipate will be utilized more frequently with our legacy HPC business and products.
Primary competitors for home appliances include Newell Brands (Sunbeam, Mr. Coffee, Crockpot, Oster), De’Longhi America (DeLonghi, Kenwood, Braun), SharkNinja (Shark, Ninja), Hamilton Beach Holding Co. (Hamilton Beach, Proctor Silex), Sensio, Inc. (Bella); SEB S.A.(T-fal, Krups, Rowenta), Whirlpool Corporation (Kitchen Aid), Conair Corporation (Cuisinart, Waring), Koninklijke Philips N.V.

(Norelco), The Procter & Gamble Company (Braun), Conair Corporation, Wahl Clipper Corporation, and Helen of Troy Limited.
Sales from electric personal care product categories tend to increase during the December holiday season (the Company's fiscal first quarter), while small appliances sales typically increase from July through December primarily due to the increased demand by customers in the late summer for “back-to-school” sales (the Company's fiscal fourth quarter) and in December for the holiday season.
