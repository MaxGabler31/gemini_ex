ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
We are a leading manufacturer and distributor of premium replacement parts utilized in the maintenance, repair and service of vehicles in the automotive aftermarket industry. In addition, we continue to increase our supplier capabilities with a complementary focus on specialized original equipment parts for manufacturers across multiple industries such as agriculture, heavy duty, and construction equipment. We believe that our extensive design and engineering capabilities have afforded us opportunities to expand our product coverage in our aftermarket business and enter newer specialized markets that require application-specific knowledge, such as those mentioned above.
 
Our business strategy centers on providing our customers with full-line product coverage as well as a suite of services tailored to our customers’ needs.  This combination of broad product coverage along with specificity in our customer service helps drive higher end-user demand for our products.
 
We sell our products primarily to automotive aftermarket retailers, warehouse distributors, original equipment manufacturers and original equipment service part operations in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, Mexico and other Latin American countries.
 
The Automotive Aftermarket
 
The automotive aftermarket replacement parts business is a mature industry that primarily tends to follow trends, such as:
 


 Index

• | number of vehicles on the road;
--+--------------------------------


• | average age of vehicles on the road; and
--+-----------------------------------------


• | total number of miles driven per year.
--+---------------------------------------

 
Other general trends including economic factors such as the level of light vehicle production can have a more indirect impact on the aftermarket, and a more direct impact on the specialized industries discussed above.
 
The automotive aftermarket industry is comprised of a large number of diverse manufacturers varying in product specialization and size.  In addition to manufacturing, aftermarket companies must allocate resources towards an efficient distribution process in order to maintain the flexibility and responsiveness on which their customers depend.  Aftermarket manufacturers must be efficient producers of small lot sizes, and must distribute, with rapid turnaround times, products for nearly all domestic and import vehicles on the road today.
 
In 2021, we completed three acquisitions that expanded our business into original equipment (OE) specialized markets that complement our core aftermarket business.  In addition to providing access to product technologies suitable to the aftermarket, and manufacturing and engineering capabilities to support our operating strategy to bring more product manufacturing in-house, these acquisitions provide geographic expansion in Europe and Asia.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
Our mission is to be the best full-line, full-service supplier of premium engine management and temperature control products.
 
The key elements of our strategy are as follows:
 

• | Maintain Our Strong Aftermarket Competitive Position in our Engine Management and Temperature Control Businesses. We are a leading independent manufacturer and distributor serving North America and other geographic areas in our core businesses of Engine Management and Temperature Control. We believe that our success is attributable to our emphasis on product quality, the breadth and depth of our product lines for both domestic and import vehicles, and our reputation for outstanding value-added services.

Our Products & Services
 
Engine Management Segment
 
Our Engine Management Segment manufactures and distributes a full line of critical components for most years, makes and models of vehicles on the road, including new technologies. Key product categories within our engine management portfolio include: (i) ignition, such as electronic ignition control modules, camshaft and crankshaft position sensors, ignition wires and coils; (ii) electrical, such as switches and relays; (iii) emissions, such as exhaust gas recirculation valves, pressure and temperature sensors and variable valve timing (VVT) components; (iv) fuel, such as mass airflow sensors, fuel pressure sensors, electronic throttle bodies and fuel injectors, including diesel injectors and pumps (new and remanufactured); and (v) safety-related systems, such as various sensors including anti-lock brake (ABS), vehicle speed, tire pressure monitoring (TPMS) and park assist sensors.
 
We continuously look to expand our product offering.  Recently, we have done so by adding late-model coverage for existing product categories, and new product categories in response to new and evolving vehicle technologies, including diesel control modules, pumps and components, turbochargers, evaporation emission control system components, exhaust gas temperature sensors, active grill shutters, battery current sensors, and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) components, including blind spot detection sensors, cruise control distance sensors, lane departure sensor cameras and park assist backup cameras. For example, our offering includes more than seventy product categories for one of the first mass-produced hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs).  As more HEVs enter the aftermarket, we intend to expand our product offering to service this important segment.
 
Ignition, Emission Control, Fuel & Safety Related System Products.  Replacement parts for ignition, emission, fuel and safety related systems accounted for $786.5 million, or 61%, of our consolidated net sales in 2021, $691.7 million, or 61%, of our consolidated net sales in 2020, and $706 million, or 62%, of our consolidated net sales in 2019.
 
As the use and complexity of vehicle systems continue to develop and proliferate, we expect to identify and benefit from new sales opportunities. All new vehicles are factory‑equipped with numerous electronic control modules designed to monitor and control the internal combustion process and the emissions, transmission, safety and comfort systems of the vehicle.  Newer automotive systems include Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and Collision Avoidance Systems to alert the driver to potential problems, or to avoid collisions by implementing safeguards. Many of these systems use on-board computers to monitor inputs from sensing devices located throughout the vehicle.  Our sales of sensors, switches, actuators, valves, solenoids and related parts have increased as automobile manufacturers continue to equip their cars with these more complex engine management systems.
 
New sales opportunities have also arisen in the United States as a result of government regulations regarding safety and emissions.  Legally, automobiles must now comply with emissions standards from the time they were manufactured and, in most states, until the last day they are in use.  Emissions laws and fuel economy regulations have had a positive impact on sales of our ignition, emissions control and fuel delivery parts since vehicles failing these laws may require repairs utilizing parts sold by us. Similarly, as government-mandated safety devices, such as anti-lock braking systems and air bags mature, requiring servicing and repair, we anticipate increased sales opportunities for many of our products such as ABS sensors, TPMS sensors and traction control products.
 
Wire & Cable Products.  Wire and cable parts accounted for $151.4 million, or 12%, of our consolidated net sales in 2021, $144 million, or 13%, of our consolidated net sales in 2020, and $143.2 million, or 13%, of our consolidated net sales in 2019.  These products include spark plug wire sets, battery cables, pigtails, sockets and a wide range of electrical wire, terminals, connectors and tools for servicing an automobile’s electrical system.
 Index
Temperature Control Segment
 
Our Temperature Control Segment manufactures and distributes a full line of critical components for the temperature control (air conditioning and heating) systems, engine cooling systems, power window accessories and windshield washer systems of motor vehicles.  Key product categories within our temperature control portfolio include: air conditioning compressors (new and remanufactured), air conditioning repair kits, clutch assemblies, blower and radiator fan motors (brushless and brushed), filter dryers, evaporators, accumulators, actuators, hose assemblies, thermal expansion devices, heater valves, heater cores, A/C service tools and chemicals, fan assemblies, fan clutches, oil coolers, window lift motors, window regulators and assemblies, and windshield washer pumps.
 
We continuously look to improve our cost position through strategic transactions with manufacturers in low cost regions.  In 2014, we formed Foshan GWOYNG SMP Vehicle Climate Control & Cooling Products Co. Ltd., a China-based joint venture that manufactures light vehicle and heavy duty air conditioning accumulators, filter driers, hose assemblies, and switches; in 2017, we formed Foshan FGD SMP Automotive Compressor Co., Ltd., a China-based joint venture that manufactures light vehicle and heavy duty belt driven air conditioning compressors; and in 2019, we acquired a minority interest ownership position in Foshan Che Yijia New Energy Technology Co., Ltd., a China-based manufacturer of electric air conditioning compressors.  We believe that these transactions will enhance our position as a basic low-cost manufacturer and a leading supplier of temperature control parts and allow an opportunity for growth in the China OE market, while providing key complementary manufacturing capabilities and synergy opportunities with our other manufacturing facilities. The synchronization and complimentary strategies between our operational and distribution facilities provides a more reliable supply of products, and supports our customers’ needs for consistent and reliable service levels.
 
Compressors.  Compressors accounted for $206.7 million, or 16%, of our consolidated net sales in 2021, $163.1 million, or 14%, of our consolidated net sales in 2020, and $160.5 million, or 14%, of our consolidated net sales in 2019. Included in consolidated net sales for the compressor product line is the revenue generated from the sale of kits.
Other Climate Control Parts.  Other climate control parts accounted for $141.7 million, or 11%, of our consolidated net sales in 2021, $118.9 million, or 11%, of our consolidated net sales in 2020, and $117.9 million, or 10%, of our consolidated net sales in 2019.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are one of the leading independent manufacturers and distributors serving North America and other geographic areas in our core businesses of Engine Management and Temperature Control.  In the Engine Management Segment, we compete with: ACDelco, Aptiv Plc, Denso Corporation, Continental AG, Hitachi, Ltd., Motorcraft, Robert Bosch GmbH, Visteon Corporation, NGK Spark Plug Co., Ltd., Dorman Products, Inc. and several privately-owned companies primarily importing products from Asia.  In the Temperature Control Segment, we compete with: ACDelco, MAHLE GmbH, Denso Corporation, Motorcraft, Sanden International (U.S.A.), Inc., Continental AG, Dorman Products, Inc., and several privately-owned companies.
 
Our business operates in highly competitive markets, and we face substantial competition in all markets that we serve.  In addition, in the aftermarket, we face competition from automobile manufacturers who supply many of the replacement parts sold by us, although these manufacturers generally supply parts only for cars they sell through OE dealerships. 
 
Sales and Distribution
 
In the traditional aftermarket channel, we sell our products to warehouse distributors and retailers.  Our customers buy directly from us and sell directly to jobber stores, professional technicians and to “do-it-yourselfers” who perform automotive repairs on their personal vehicles.  In recent years, warehouse distributors have consolidated with other distributors, and an increasing number of distributors own their jobber stores or sell down channel to professional technicians.  Retailers are also consolidating with other retailers and have begun to increase their efforts to sell to professional technicians adding additional competition in the “do-it-for-me,” or the professional technician segment of our industry.  As automotive parts and systems become more complex, “do-it-yourselfers” are less likely to service their own vehicles and may become more reliant on professional technicians.
 Index
In the heavy duty aftermarket, we sell our products to recognized distributors who buy directly from us and sell directly to fleet operators and repair facilities for use in the repair and maintenance of medium to heavy duty vehicles. We also sell our products to the service parts divisions of heavy duty OEMs for distribution into the independent heavy duty aftermarket.
 
In the original equipment market we sell our products to manufacturers of automotive, heavy duty truck, construction, agriculture, alternative energy, lawn/garden and powersports/marine vehicles and equipment, as well as their tier suppliers and system integrators.  We also sell and support the service part divisions of each of our customers.
 
We sell our products primarily in the United States, with additional sales in Canada, Europe, Asia, Mexico and other Latin American countries.  Our sales are substantially denominated in U.S. dollars.  For information on revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area, see Note 19 “Industry Segment and Geographic Data” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.
 
Our customers have come to depend on our sales personnel as a reliable source for technical information and to assist with sales to their customers (e.g., jobber stores and professional technicians).  In this manner, we direct a significant portion of our sales efforts to our customers’ customers to generate demand for our products, and we believe that the structure of our sales force facilitates these efforts by enabling us to implement our sales and marketing programs uniformly throughout the distribution channel.
 
Another way we generate demand for our products is through our training program, which offers training seminars to professional automotive technicians.  Our training program is accredited by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) Training Managers Council.  Our seminars are taught by ASE certified instructors in real time either in-person or by webinars online and feature more than 30 different topics.  We also offer on-demand training webinars online on more than 150 different topics.  Through our training program, we typically teach approximately 60,000 technicians annually how to diagnose and repair vehicles equipped with complex systems related to our products, and we have approximately 16,000 technicians who are registered to participate in such sessions through our online platform.
 
We offer a variety of strategic customer discounts, allowances and incentives to increase customer purchases of our products.  For example, we offer cash discounts for paying invoices in accordance with the specified discounted terms of the invoice.  We also offer rebates and discounts to customers as advertising and sales force allowances, and allowances for warranty and overstock returns are also provided.  We believe these discounts, allowances and incentives are a common practice throughout the automotive aftermarket industry, and we intend to continue to offer them in response to competitive pressures and to strategically support the growth of all our products.
 
Seasonality
 
Historically, our operating results have fluctuated by quarter, with the greatest sales occurring in the second and third quarters of the year and revenues generally being recognized at the time of shipment.  It is in these quarters that demand for our products is typically the highest, specifically in the Temperature Control Segment of our business.  In addition to this seasonality, the demand for our Temperature Control products during the second and third quarters of the year may vary significantly with the summer weather and customer inventories.  Ordinarily, a warm summer, as we experienced in 2021, would increase the demand for our Temperature Control products, while a somewhat mild summer, as we experienced in 2019, may lessen such demand.  While the COVID-19 pandemic caused large shifts in sales demand between quarters in 2020, our business returned to a more normalized pattern of seasonality and variability in demand of our Temperature Control products in 2021.  As such, our working capital typically peaks near the end of the second quarter, as the inventory build-up of air conditioning products was converted to sales, and payments on the receivables associated with such sales were yet to be received.  During this period, our working capital requirements were funded by borrowing from our revolving credit facility.
 Index
Working Capital and Inventory Management
 
Automotive aftermarket companies have been under increasing pressure to provide broad SKU (stock keeping unit) coverage due to parts and brand proliferation.  In response to this, we have made, and continue to make, changes to our inventory management system designed to reduce inventory requirements.  We have a pack‑to‑order distribution system, which permits us to retain slow moving items in a bulk storage state until an order for a specific branded part is received.  This system reduces the volume of a given part in inventory.  We also expanded our inventory management system to improve inventory deployment, enhance our collaboration with customers on forecasts and inventory assortments, and further integrate our supply chain both to customers and suppliers.
 
We face inventory management issues as a result of overstock returns.  We permit our customers to return new, undamaged products to us within customer-specific limits (which are generally limited to a specified percentage of their annual purchases from us) in the event that they have overstocked their inventories.  In addition, the seasonality of our Temperature Control Segment requires that we increase our inventory during the winter season in preparation of the summer selling season and customers purchasing such inventory have the right to make returns.  We accrue for overstock returns as a percentage of sales after giving consideration to recent returns history.
 
Our profitability and working capital requirements are seasonal due to our sales mix of Temperature Control products.  Our working capital requirements typically peak near the end of the second quarter, as the inventory build‑up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received.  These increased working capital requirements are funded by borrowings from our revolving credit facility.
 
Production and Engineering
 
An important component of our business strategy is to invest the resources necessary to expand our technical capabilities and bring more product manufacturing in-house. We engineer, tool and manufacture many of the products that we offer for sale and the components used in the assembly of those products, and we continue to evaluate opportunities to bring new product categories in-house.  For example, we perform our own plastic molding operations, stamping and machining operations, wire extrusion, automated electronics assembly and a wide variety of other processes.  In the case of remanufactured components, we conduct our own teardown, diagnostics and rebuilding for air conditioning compressors, diesel injectors, and diesel pumps.  We have found this level of vertical integration, in combination with our manufacturing footprint in low cost regions, provides advantages in terms of cost, quality and availability.
Suppliers
 
We source materials through a global network of suppliers to ensure a consistent, high quality and low cost supply of materials and key components for our product lines.  As a result of the breadth of our product offering, we are not dependent on any single raw material.
 
The principal raw materials purchased by us consist of brass, electronic components, fabricated copper (primarily in the form of magnet and insulated cable), steel magnets, laminations, tubes and shafts, stamped steel parts, copper wire, stainless steel coils and rods, aluminum coils, fittings, rods, cast aluminum parts, lead, steel roller bearings, rubber molding compound, thermo‑set and thermo plastic molding powders, and chemicals.  Additionally, we use components and cores (used parts) in our remanufacturing processes for air conditioning compressors, diesel injectors, and diesel pumps.
 
In the case of cores for air conditioning compressors, diesel injectors, and diesel pumps, we obtain them either from exchanges with customers who return cores subsequent to purchasing remanufactured parts or through direct purchases from a network of core brokers.  In addition, we acquire certain materials by purchasing products that are resold into the market, particularly by OEM sources and other domestic and foreign suppliers.
 


 Index
We believe there is an adequate supply of primary raw materials and cores; however, disruptions in the global economy in 2020 and the lingering impacts into 2021 have impeded global supply chains, resulting in longer lead times and delays in procuring component parts and raw materials, and inflationary cost increases in certain raw materials, labor and transportation.  In response to the global supply chain volatility and inflationary cost increases, we have taken, and continue to take, several actions to mitigate the impact by working closely with our suppliers and customers to minimize any potential adverse impacts on our business, including initiating cost savings initiatives and the pass through of higher costs to our customers, which began in the fourth quarter of 2021.  We believe that we have also benefited from our geographically diversified manufacturing footprint and our strategy to bring more product manufacturing in-house, especially with respect to product availability and fill rates.
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital
 
Our Culture
 
Our Company was founded in 1919 on the values of integrity, common decency and respect for others.  These values continue to this day and are embodied in our Code of Ethics, which has been adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company to serve as a statement of principles to guide our decision-making and reinforce our commitment to these values in all aspects of our business.  These values also serve as the foundation for our increased focus on many important environmental, social and governance issues, such as environmental stewardship and our efforts to identify and implement practices that reduce our environmental impact while achieving our business goals; our attention to diversity, equity and inclusion, employee development, retention, and health and safety; and our community engagement initiatives, to name a few.  We have made significant strides building awareness of the environmental impact of our operations, and challenging ourselves to reduce our impact by reducing our consumption of energy and generation of waste, as well as enhancing our recycling efforts.
Environmental Stewardship
 
We have made significant strides building awareness of the environmental impact of our operations, and challenging ourselves to reduce our impact by reducing our consumption of energy, including electricity, natural gas and propane; reducing our generation of waste and increasing the percentage of waste recycled; reducing our use of water and reducing our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions.
 
We are also focused on several initiatives that are intended to promote a more environmentally-friendly car parc. Through our remanufacturing processes, we divert certain types of used automotive products from traditional waste streams and reprocess them for their original purpose.  We remanufacture key product categories within our product portfolio, such as air conditioning compressors, diesel injectors and diesel pumps, resulting in the production of premium automotive products within these categories through processes that we believe save energy and reduce waste. We also bring to market emission control system products, which are designed to reduce emissions and improve fuel economy during vehicle operation, and alternative energy products, which utilize cleaner burning fuels or are designed for electric or hybrid electric vehicles.
 
Human Capital
 
We believe that our commitment to our employees is critical to our continued success, and has led to high employee satisfaction and low employee turnover.  To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to have a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities.  Our employees share our corporate values of integrity, common decency and respect of others, values which have been established since our company was founded.
 Index
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 5,000 people, with 2,000 people in the United States and 3,000 people in Mexico, Canada, Poland, the U.K., Germany, Hungary, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.  Of the 5,000 people employed, approximately 2,700 people are production employees.  We operate primarily in non‑union facilities and have binding labor agreements with employees at other unionized facilities.  We have approximately 80 production employees in Edwardsville, Kansas who are covered by a contract with The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (“UAW”) that expires in August 2022.  We also have approximately 1,500 employees in Mexico who are covered under union agreements negotiated at various intervals. For clarification, the employee numbers described above exclude the employees of our joint venture operations.
 
Although the COVID-19 pandemic has led to some challenges in finding adequate labor, generally we believe that our facilities are in labor markets with ready access to adequate numbers of skilled and unskilled workers, and we believe our relations with our union and non‑union employees are good.
 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.  We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, and we continue to focus on the hiring, retention and advancement of women and underrepresented populations.  Our recent efforts have been focused in three areas: inspiring innovation through an inclusive and diverse culture; expanding our efforts to recruit and hire world-class diverse talent; and identifying strategic partners to accelerate our inclusion and diversity programs.  Over the last 5 years, approximately 50% of our hires and promotions have been women or racially diverse individuals.  To further our commitment to diversity, in 2021, we established a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion steering committee to develop key structures within our organization to promote equality, inclusion and awareness among our employees.
Health, Safety and Wellness.  The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people.  Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees.  We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security so they can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work, or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families.
 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and which comply with government regulations.  These include providing employees with flexible working arrangements, including where appropriate the ability to work from home, and implementing a number of safety policies and practices at all of our facilities.
 
Compensation and Benefits.  We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs that meet the needs of our employees.  In addition to wages and salaries, these programs include annual cash bonuses, stock awards, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, and employee assistance programs.
Talent Development.  We invest significant resources to develop the talent of our high potential employees.  We deliver numerous training opportunities, provide rotational assignment opportunities, have expanded our focus on continuous learning and development, and implemented methodologies to manage performance, provide feedback and develop talent.

Social Engagement and Community Service
 
We believe that building connections between our employees, their families and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace.  Through our SMP Cares® initiative, we sponsor corporate giving and volunteering programs to encourage our employees to connect with our local communities and engage in the local causes that they are passionate about.
 
Our volunteering efforts include organizing blood drives with the American Red Cross, and fundraising for the March of Dimes, United Way, the Salvation Army, and many others.  In 2021, we collaborated with our employees to donate over $50,000 to local community organizations, hospitals, schools, shelters, and universities.  We are a lifetime trustee of the University of the Aftermarket Foundation (“UAF”), and we donate $10,000 annually to fund scholarships to support the next generation of technicians and automotive professionals, which we believe is an important way to sustain and give back to our industry.  We are also proud to sponsor annual scholarship contests for future automotive technicians, including our Women in Auto Care scholarship that aims to empower women entering the automotive industry.  Since our first scholarship contest in 2015, we have awarded $265,000 in scholarships.  We have continued to expand our scholarship program, and in 2021, we awarded ten students each with a $5,000 scholarship.  We continue to encourage participation in these initiatives as we believe they are essential in the support of our core values.
 
Governance
 
Our commitment to ESG is spearheaded by our Board of Directors. Specifically, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee established an ESG steering committee among our executive officers including our Chief Executive Officer & President, Chief Legal Officer & Secretary, Chief Human Resources Officer, and Senior Vice President of North American Operations. This ESG steering committee is tasked with developing specific strategies to ensure that our operations adhere to our corporate governance values and advance our ESG objectives.  The multidisciplinary approach of our steering committee allows it to leverage our expertise in operations, engineering, supply chain, human capital management, finance, legal and other fields to push our ESG initiatives ahead from all angles.
