Item 1. Business. 
Merger of Neothetics, Inc. and Evofem Biosciences Operations, Inc. 
 On January 17, 2018, Neothetics, Inc., or Neothetics, and privately-held Evofem Biosciences Operations, Inc., or Private Evofem, completed the merger and reorganization, or the Merger, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated October 17, 2017, or the Merger Agreement, by and among Neothetics, Private Evofem and Nobelli Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Neothetics, or Merger Sub, whereby Merger Sub merged with and into Private Evofem, with Private Evofem surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Neothetics. The Merger was structured as a reverse capitalization and Private Evofem was determined to be the accounting acquirer based on the terms of the Merger and other factors. 
 On January 17, 2018, in connection with the Merger, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation to affect a six-for-one reverse stock split of its common stock, or the Reverse Split, which caused the Company not to be governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, and to change its name from “Neothetics, Inc.” to “Evofem Biosciences, Inc.” The name change and the Reverse Split were both effected on January 17, 2018. Shares of the Company’s common stock commenced trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the new name and ticker symbol “EVFM” as of market open on January 18, 2018. Unless otherwise noted, all references to share amounts in this Annual Report, including references to shares or options issued in connection with the Merger and the Financing (as defined below), reflect the Reverse Split.
 On January 17, 2018, immediately following the completion of the Merger, the Company issued in a private placement transaction, or the Financing, an aggregate of 1,614,289 shares of its common stock to certain accredited investors for an aggregate purchase price of $20 million pursuant to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated October 17, 2017, by and among the Company, Private Evofem and certain accredited investors, or the Securities Purchase Agreement. Upon consummation of the Financing, the Company terminated its existing Fourth Amended and Restated Investors’ Rights Agreement, dated September 22, 2014, by and between the Company and the investors listed therein, or the Existing Investors. Additionally, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with the accredited investors participating in the Financing and certain previous investors of Private Evofem and the Company, or the Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which the Company is, among other things, obligated to file a registration statement with the SEC within 60 days following completion of the Merger. The shares of Company common stock issued in the Financing were exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder.
 
In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company assumed Private Evofem’s Amended and Restated 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, or the Private Evofem Equity Incentive Plan, and all of the stock options outstanding under the Private Evofem Equity Incentive Plan, with such stock options now representing the right to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company also assumed warrants to purchase Private Evofem capital stock which were immediately amended and restated to be warrants, or the Post-Merger Warrants, to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Post-Merger Warrants will have an exercise price equal to the average of the closing sale prices of shares of the Company’s common stock as quoted on The Nasdaq Capital Market for the 30 consecutive trading day period immediately following January 17, 2018, and will be exercisable commencing on January 17, 2019, and until the earlier of January 17, 2022, or immediately prior to the completion of an Acceleration Event (as defined in the Post-Merger Warrants). The Post-Merger Warrants were issued as a unit with one share of the Company’s common stock, or the Unit Share. Per the terms of the Post-Merger Warrants, the Unit Shares may not be transferred separately from the Post-Merger Warrants.
 Following the completion of the Reverse Split, the Merger and the Financing, there were approximately 17,757,167 shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding. The former Private Evofem stockholders owned approximately 87% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company, or 15,448,737 shares, and the Company’s stockholders immediately prior to the Merger and Financing, whose shares of the Company’s common stock remained outstanding after the Merger and Financing, owned approximately 13% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company, or 2,308,430 shares.
 Prior to the Merger, Neothetics was originally incorporated in Delaware in February 2007 as Lipothera, Inc. In September 2008, Neothetics changed its name to Lithera, Inc. and in August 2014, Neothetics again changed its name to Neothetics, Inc. 
 Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this Annual Report to “Evofem”, “EVFM”, “we”, “us”, the “Company” and “our” refer to Evofem Biosciences, Inc. (formerly known as Neothetics).

 Overview 
 Prior to the Merger, we were a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company developing therapeutics for the aesthetic market. After the Merger, we became a clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to improving the health and well-being of women throughout the world by addressing women’s unmet medical needs through the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative, next-generation women’s healthcare products. We utilize our multi-purpose prevention technology, or MPT, in two vaginal gel product candidates that are being developed for multiple indications, including contraception, sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, and bacterial vaginosis, or BV. 
 Our lead product candidate, Amphora® (L-lactic Acid, citric acid, and potassium bitartrate) is a hormone-free, on demand, woman-controlled vaginal gel currently in a Phase 3 clinical trial with contraceptive efficacy as the primary endpoint, and in a Phase 2b/3 trial with a primary endpoint for the prevention of urogenital chlamydia in women.  Additionally, this second trial evaluates the efficacy of Amphora for the prevention of urogenital gonorrhea as a second endpoint. In addition, we recently completed a Phase 1 trial of our MPT vaginal gel product candidate for the reduction of recurrent BV and we are currently designing a Phase 2b/3 trial for this indication. 
 Based on our market research, we believe a majority of women seeking birth control are concerned about exposure to hormones. While hormone-based contraception is the current standard in female birth control, our research indicates that women are actively seeking alternative methods of contraception, but have limited options to reduce exposure to hormones. As a result, women are dissatisfied with current products on the market. Amphora is designed to empower women by offering a hormone-free, on demand, woman-controlled contraceptive. 
 Our MPT vaginal gels have also demonstrated a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro, including on chlamydia-, gonorrhea-, and bacterial vaginosis- causing microbes, the three most common causes of reproductive tract infection. There are currently no products indicated for the prevention of urogenital chlamydia or gonorrhea or the reduction of recurrent BV. We believe our MPT vaginal gel product candidates offer a significant opportunity to address these important unmet medical needs for women. 
 Amphora has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for the prevention of acquisition of urogenital chlamydia.  A drug that receives Fast Track designation will have opportunities to expedite development and review, such as more frequent interactions with the FDA and eligibility for priority review. A priority review designation means FDA’s goal is to act on the marketing application within six months of receipt compared with 10 months under standard review.
 Amphora has also been granted designation as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, by the FDA for prevention of acquisition of urogenital gonorrhea infection in women and for reduction of recurrent BV. A drug that receives QIDP designation can also qualify for the FDA’s Fast Track program. QIDP designations also provide an additional five years of marketing exclusivity for an approved product. 
 We have an exclusive worldwide license to our MPT vaginal gel from Rush University, a nationally recognized research institution. Our MPT vaginal gel was initially developed by the Program for Topical Prevention of Conception and Disease, an organization led by Rush University dedicated to the discovery and creation of topical products that can prevent pregnancy and the spread of STIs. 
 Our Strategy 
 We are committed to providing women with direct control and management of their sexual and reproductive health. Key elements of our strategy include: 
  
• | Actively monitor the completion of the Phase 3 clinical trial for the purpose of seeking approval of and subsequently commercializing Amphora for contraception. Our initial focus is the development and commercialization of Amphora as a hormone-free, on demand, woman-controlled contraceptive. We believe this will create a platform for us to advance our supplemental indications and allow us to effectively deploy investor capital for the benefit of all stakeholders.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our MPT vaginal gel technology platform to develop and commercialize novel, first-in-class products for women. We intend to expand on our contraceptive indication by being the first company to market a contraceptive product with additional indications for the prevention of urogenital chlamydia and gonorrhea. In addition, we intend to develop a product for the reduction of recurrent BV.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our intellectual property position by pursuing opportunities to extend the exclusivity of our highly differentiated and proprietary MPT vaginal gel. We intend to aggressively pursue additional and new patent applications to broaden our

intellectual property portfolio. We will continue to seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our product pipeline. We intend to opportunistically acquire additional products or product candidates from third parties that enhance our offerings and complement our core competencies in women’s healthcare.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build a world class organization committed to the discovery, development and commercialization of products that address unmet needs in women’s sexual and reproductive health. We have assembled a world class team with industry-recognized expertise in the development and commercialization of products in women’s healthcare. We intend to continue to build on our leadership position and grow a culture dedicated to the development and commercialization of medicines that address the unmet medical needs of women.

The Contraceptive Market Overview 
 In 2016, the global revenue for contraceptive products was $21.2 billion and projected to grow at 6.8% per annum to $35.8 billion by 2024, making contraception a substantial and growing subset of the overall healthcare market. This growth is expected to continue to be driven by the United States and Europe where favorable government policies aimed at preventing unwanted pregnancies are in place. The number of women using contraception is projected to grow through 2030. 
 Current contraceptive options include devices designed to prevent pregnancy through physical means such as condoms, diaphragms and intrauterine devices, or IUDs, and pharmaceutical means such as a variety of hormonal-based approaches, including oral contraceptives, vaginal rings containing hormones, intramuscular injections, subcutaneous implants and transdermal patches. 
 Existing contraceptive options can have significant side effects or other limitations. Long-acting options such as IUDs, hormonal injections and implants require medical procedures and are not quickly or easily reversible. Hormonal approaches can be associated with undesirable side-effects such as weight gain and mood changes, which may lead women to seek alternative contraceptive technologies or decide to not use any form of the contraceptive options currently available. Several spermicidal products currently available over-the-counter for use as vaginal contraceptives are based on surfactants, which can cause genital irritation and inflammation that may increase the risk of contracting human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, or other STIs from an infected partner. For example, spermicides containing the active ingredient nonoxynol-9, or N-9, have been required by the FDA to carry a label warning for the risk of contracting HIV. Unlike other vaginal contraceptives currently on the market, Amphora is free of surfactants such as N-9. 
 The unmet medical needs of the contraception market and the shift away from traditional methods of contraception such as oral contraceptives make the entry of a non-hormonal contraceptive option such as Amphora timely and desirable. Currently, the only non-hormonal prescription contraceptive methods approved in the U.S. market are a copper IUD, which requires an invasive medical procedure and could remain in the user’s body for up to 10 years and a diaphragm, which can be difficult to insert and must be used with contraceptive gel. 
 Additionally, we believe that growing concern associated with the increasing prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases along with growing demand for new innovative contraception options will drive further growth in the global contraceptive market. 
 Market Opportunity 
 We believe our key market strengths are as follows: 
  
• | Our MPT vaginal gel is potentially disruptive to the existing contraceptive landscape and is designed to address underserved and unmet needs in the women’s healthcare market;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We expect to benefit from favorable trends away from the daily use of oral forms of hormonal contraception to more innovative technologies that underpin the large and growing global contraceptive market;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have robust proprietary technology protected by an intellectual property portfolio currently extended to 2033; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We intend to add indications to our lead product candidate, Amphora, and to add complementary products or product candidates to our pipeline expected to provide future growth opportunities within the global contraceptive market.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe our product candidates are well positioned to fulfill unmet needs within the existing contraceptive market and to compete with existing contraceptive options. Market penetration requires development and implementation of a tailored strategy, involving healthcare policy officials and healthcare providers for each country or territory. 
 Innovation and new product introduction in women’s reproductive healthcare and contraception has been limited when compared to other leading therapeutic categories. There were no approvals in women’s contraception during 2017 as compared to, for example, oncology, where there have been more than 40 approvals in the same period, demonstrating a unique opportunity in this underdeveloped field.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC, reducing the percentage of all unintended pregnancies has been one of the National Health Promotion Objectives since they were first established in 1980. Despite the efforts to reduce their prevalence, over 2.0 million unintended pregnancies occur in the U.S. annually. Following decades of minimal change or increase, the percentage of unintended pregnancies in the U.S. decreased slightly in the period from 2008-2011. Despite this recent decrease, 45% of pregnancies in the U.S. are still unintended. Nearly all women with sexual experience in the U.S. have used contraception at some time in their lives, but many women may not use contraception consistently or correctly and subsequently become pregnant when not intending to have a child at that time. According to research conducted by the CDC, approximately 40% of women surveyed after giving birth to a child resulting from an unintended pregnancy who were not using contraception noted one of the following three reasons for nonuse: did not expect to have sex, worried about side effects of birth control, or male partner did not want to use birth control. 
 Hundreds of millions of women worldwide seek contraceptive products during an average 30 plus years of fertility. As such, women utilizing contraception consider the most appropriate methods for their purposes and intended use. The following information outlines expected trends in contraceptive usage in different regions of the world and outlines differences between the U.S. and European Union, or EU, contraceptive markets.

--+-----------------------------

The U.S. Contraceptive Market 
 The total U.S. contraceptive market was valued at $5.5 billion in 2016 with the prescription contraceptive market expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.4% from 2013 to 2024 and reach a value of approximately $8.4 billion in 2024. The U.S. contraceptive market represented the largest segment of the global contraceptives market in 2016 at 29.4% and is currently dominated by hormonal methods including birth control pills and other reversible methods such as IUDs and injectables. Approximately four of every five women with sexual experience in the U.S. have used the pill at least one time with this percentage remaining stable since 1995. 
 More than 12 million women in the U.S. rely on condoms, or some other form of non-hormonal contraception (e.g. copper IUD, diaphragm, rhythm, withdrawal) as their method of choice. 
 We conducted market research with women of reproductive age (ages 18 to 49) and healthcare providers in the U.S. to evaluate potential interest in Amphora. Of the more than 1,400 women surveyed, approximately one-third expressed interest in learning more about Amphora. Amphora’s most motivating attributes for women surveyed included lack of hormones, ease of use and the ability to use on demand. Physicians also expressed interest in Amphora, indicating they see many patients for whom they would recommend use of Amphora. 
 Additionally, this market research indicated that an Amphora user would receive approximately seven refills of Amphora per year based on reported frequency of intercourse.

The EU Contraceptive Market 
 The EU contraceptive market was valued at approximately $5.0 billion in 2016, or 24.5% of the global market, and is expected to grow at an average compound annual growth rate of 5.4% from 2013 to 2024 to reach an estimated value of approximately $7.6 billion in 2024. The EU accounted for the second largest market share in the global contraceptives market in 2016. Contraceptive use in the EU varies from region to region. As the table below shows, approximately 30% of women use no contraception and the use of male condoms is significantly higher than the U.S. population (9.4%). Permanent sterilization is also substantially lower than the U.S. (female and male sterilization rates of 14.3% and 4.5%, respectively) and among newer innovations only IUDs are in double digit market share:

Product Candidates 
 Amphora as a Contraceptive 
 We believe Amphora, our lead product candidate, addresses significant gaps in the contraceptive market. If approved by the FDA, Amphora will be the only hormone-free, on demand, women-controlled contraceptive drug product available by prescription in the United States that does not require in-office placement by a healthcare provider. 
 We believe Amphora has significant attributes that will make it an attractive contraceptive choice for women: 
 
 
Key Attributes | Potential Benefits 
------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hormone-free | Amphora is hormone-free and designed to avoid known side effects of hormonal-based contraceptives, which include weight gain, headaches, sore breasts, irregular periods, mood changes, decreased sexual desire, acne and nausea. These side effects have been shown to discourage women from continuing to use hormonal contraception on a long-term basis, leading them to seek alternative methods or decide to use nothing at all.
On Demand/Woman-controlled | Amphora can be used as needed - no daily, weekly, or monthly routine. Amphora may be used immediately before or up to one hour before intercourse at a woman’s discretion. 
No Surgical Procedures | No physician insertion or removal required. The use of Amphora is private and discrete and avoids the need for recurring doctor appointments, clinical or surgical procedures. 
Cost Effective | We anticipate coverage in the United States under the Affordable Care Act, or the ACA. Amphora is only used when needed thus eliminating cost for daily use methods. 
Surfactant-free | Amphora can be used by women who experience allergy, sensitivity, or side effects to N-9. 
Personal Lubricant Properties | Amphora has benefits for vaginal use, as a personal lubricant, beyond the primary contraceptive function. Amphora reduces friction and eases penetration. 
Bioadhesive Properties | Amphora has bioadhesive and viscosity-retaining properties to form a long-lasting layer of gel over the vaginal and cervical surfaces, which may reduce leakage from the vagina. 
Ease of Use | The pre-filled Amphora applicator is designed for convenience and to be stored at room temperature for ease of handling and use.

The CDC’s recommendations for use of combined hormonal contraception, as shown below, define numerous conditions that create unacceptable health risks if hormonal contraception is used. The number of women impacted by these conditions is significant. We believe Amphora, if approved by the FDA, will provide women an attractive solution to avoid hormones and certain other negative side effects from current prescription contraceptives.

 Mechanism of Action in Contraception 
 A normal vaginal pH of 3.5 to 4.5 is important for maintaining good vaginal health. At this optimal pH level, the vagina contains a balance of necessary healthy bacteria. Additionally, a vaginal pH in this range is inhospitable to spermatozoa, or sperm, as well as certain viral and bacterial pathogens. Amphora was developed to have acid-buffering (pH 3.5), bioadhesive, and viscosity-retaining properties to provide effective acidification of the male ejaculate in the vagina and to form a long-lasting layer of gel over the vaginal and cervical surfaces. Typically, the introduction of semen (pH = 7.2-8.0) into the vagina causes a rise in pH above 6.0 due to the alkalinity of the ejaculate, which neutralizes the normally acidic vaginal environment and allows the survival of sperm. Amphora acts as a vaginal contraceptive by maintaining a normal vaginal pH (pH = 3.5-4.5) even in the presence of semen, inhibiting sperm from reaching the ovum to form a zygote. This buffering capacity is due to Amphora’s active pharmaceutical ingredients. Other properties contributing to the contraceptive effect of Amphora are its capacity to reduce/inhibit cervical mucus penetration, to maintain sufficient viscosity even upon dilution with the introduction of semen into the vagina and its bioadhesive strength. After proper use of Amphora, postcoital testing shows Amphora remains protective for up to 10 hours based on a lack of progressively motile sperm.

The diagram below shows the respective pH levels of the vagina and semen.

Amphora Clinical Trials 
 Amphora: Phase 3 Clinical Trial (AMP001) 
 A key stage in the development of Amphora was the completion of a large-scale Phase 3 clinical trial comparing the contraceptive effectiveness, safety and acceptability of Amphora to Conceptrol®, a surfactant-based spermicidal gel containing 4% N-9, which is currently available over-the-counter for use as a vaginal contraceptive. The primary endpoint of the trial was the six-month cumulative pregnancy rate. Secondary endpoints included local and systemic signs and symptoms reported by participants or observed upon medical examination, such as itching, burning, irritation, inflammation or lesions to the cervical or vaginal epithelia and vaginal infections. 
AMP001 Trial Design and Implementation 
 During 2011 through 2014, the AMP001 Amphora Phase 3 clinical trial enrolled 3,389 women at approximately 70 research centers located within the United States and Russia. It was an open-label, randomized, non-inferiority trial of repeated use of Amphora compared to Conceptrol over seven cycles of use. After completing the first seven cycles, some of the women randomized to Amphora continued for up to a total of 13 cycles. In a subset of women (75 in each treatment arm) the lower genital tract (cervix, vagina, and vulva) was observed and photographed by colposcopy. The subset was blinded to avoid possible observer bias. A second subset was also examined microbiologically to document any changes in the vaginal flora, particularly the onset of any infection by Escherichia coli or yeast. 
 Results of AMP001 Phase 3 Clinical Trial 
 The trial was fully enrolled in July 2013 and completed during the first half of 2014. In the primary efficacy analysis, the six-month cumulative pregnancy rate for the Modified Intent-to-Treat population, otherwise known as typical use (defined as trial subjects who had at least one episode of coitus without using the product correctly during the study and without any backup or emergency contraception), was approximately 10%. For those subjects with perfect use (defined as trial subjects who used the product correctly at every episode of coitus within a given cycle), the cumulative pregnancy rate was approximately 4%.
 AMP001 Safety data 
 Of the 30 subjects who experienced at least one serious adverse event, or SAE, 11 were treated with Amphora (0.8%) and 19 were treated with Conceptrol (1.3%). The adverse event, or AE, reporting for the 13-cycle extension did not identify additional SAEs; therefore, no subject treated with Amphora experienced an SAE with an additional six cycles of exposure to Amphora. Significantly more subjects liked Amphora than Conceptrol and significantly more Amphora users would use the product again if it were available (p<0.05 for both comparisons). 
 The table below sets out the adverse events in the AMP001 Phase 3 clinical trial. 
 Adverse events in greater than 2% of Amphora gel treated subjects in the AMP001 Phase 3 Clinical Trial in the seven-cycle study by decreasing order of frequency in all subjects:

Summary of Initial NDA Submission (Contraceptive Indication) 
 On July 2, 2015, pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food and Drug Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, we submitted a new drug application, or NDA, for Amphora to the FDA for the proposed indication of prevention of pregnancy. The submission included, among other things, data from the initial Phase 3 clinical trial (AMP001) as well as other safety and efficacy information. 
 A Complete Response Letter, or CRL, was issued by the FDA on April 28, 2016. A CRL is issued if the agency determines that the application cannot be approved in its present form and will describe all the specific deficiencies identified by the agency. A CRL will also recommend actions the applicant might take to place the application or abbreviated application in condition for approval. 
 The primary approvability issue was the difference in results between the U.S. and Russian cohorts. Although the study met its primary endpoint when the combined U.S. and Russian data were analyzed per the statistical plan, the FDA deemed the data from Russian subjects (approximately 20% of the study population) not generalizable to the U.S. population. Additionally, the FDA excluded analysis data from certain cycles, specifically data from: cycle 0, (the time from enrollment until the subject’s first menstrual cycle); cycles that were <21 days or >42 days in duration; cycles past 196 days (the aggregate length of seven cycles of 28 days in duration); and cycles in which there was no intercourse. 
 A Type A meeting was held on October 31, 2016, with the FDA, at which the FDA indicated a confirmatory efficacy trial focused on participants in North America would be required. After further consultation with the FDA, the FDA confirmed that a single-arm trial (non-comparative) would be sufficient to address the CRL clinical deficiency. All feedback received from the FDA was incorporated into a protocol for a single-arm trial which was submitted to the FDA on June 30, 2017 (AMP002). 
 Amphora: AMP002 Confirmatory Phase 3 Trial (AMPOWER) 
 We are conducting a confirmatory, single-arm, Phase 3 trial entitled “A Single-Arm, Phase III, Open Label, Multicenter, Study in Women Aged 18-35 Years of the Contraceptive Efficacy and Safety of Amphora Contraceptive Vaginal Gel.” We refer to this trial as AMPOWER or AMP002. This study was designed to enroll approximately 1,350 women aged 18 to 35 at up to 115 sites in the United States. The first subject enrolled in this trial on July 28, 2017, and enrollment was completed in February 2018. 
 The primary endpoint for this trial is a seven-cycle cumulative pregnancy rate. In addition to our primary outcome for efficacy and secondary safety outcomes, we also included an exploratory endpoint of sexual satisfaction. Since Amphora also has lubricant properties, we anticipate a positive result for the sexual satisfaction outcome, which could be further explored in future studies and potentially utilized in its labeling and marketing materials. We believe this is the first contraception registration trial to include sexual satisfaction as an outcome. 
 Scientific Advice Process in the European Union 
 We previously conducted a regulatory gap analysis with Pharmalex GmbH to determine how the EU regulatory bodies were likely to view its marketing authorization application, or MAA, upon submission to the EU. Scientific advice was previously sought in April 2016 from the Medical Products Agency of Sweden and the Agency of Medicine and Sanitary Products of Spain, but an MAA was not pursued due to a lack of resources to support a filing at that time. We have reinitiated the scientific advice process and seek marketing authorization for Amphora in the EU through a decentralized procedure. 
 Amphora for STI Prevention 
 In the U.S., the CDC reports that there were 1.6 million new cases of chlamydia and approximately 468,000 new cases of gonorrhea in 2016. We believe this represents a significant commercial opportunity for Amphora. 
 Pre-clinical tests conducted in the early developmental stages by Rush University, and later by us, suggest that our MPT vaginal gel has the potential to suppress many of the pathogens responsible for sexually transmitted and commonly occurring bacterial infections while not affecting lactobacilli, a normal and beneficial bacterium found in a healthy vagina. We are advancing Amphora into a pivotal Phase 2b/3 trial to determine the extent to which the gel prevents sexual transmission of two common STIs, urogenital chlamydia (primary endpoint) and gonorrhea (secondary endpoint) and intend to conduct additional clinical trials to determine whether the microbicide potential shown in pre-clinical results translates into protection for women. As of January 2018, the first subjects are enrolled in the Phase 2b/3 trial. Should this trial meet its primary endpoint, the FDA has indicated that it may be considered as one of two pivotal trials required for approval. 
 Amphora has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for the prevention of acquisition of urogenital chlamydia.  A drug that receives Fast Track designation will have opportunities to expedite development and review, such as more frequent interactions with the FDA and eligibility for priority review. A priority review designation means FDA’s goal is to act on the marketing application within 6 months of receipt compared with 10 months under standard review.

Amphora has been designated as a QIDP by the FDA for the prevention of urogenital gonorrhea infection in women. A drug that receives QIDP designation may qualify for an additional five years of marketing exclusivity and is eligible for the FDA’s Fast Track program, intended to facilitate development and expedite review of drugs so an approved product can reach the market expeditiously. An additional benefit is that the program allows for a priority review, with a goal of FDA action on the NDA within six months. 
 MPT Vaginal Gel for Recurrent Bacterial Vaginosis 
 The prevalence of BV in the United States is estimated to affect 21 million women, or 29.2% of women ages 14 to 49, and is considered to be the most common reproductive tract infection for women ages 15 to 44. There are currently no FDA approved products indicated for the reduction of recurrent BV. 
 Pre-clinical tests have shown our MPT vaginal gel kills many microbes responsible for recurrent BV while not affecting lactobacilli, a normal and beneficial bacterium found in a healthy vagina. The inhibitory mechanism comprises the MPT vaginal gel’s buffered acidity and the presence of active pharmaceutical ingredients in the MPV vaginal gel. Clinical studies are on-going to determine whether the anti-pathogen potential shown in the laboratory translates into protection for women. 
 We filed an Investigational New Drug, or IND, with the FDA in March 2016 to study the ability of our MPT vaginal gel for the reduction of recurrent BV. Following submission of the IND, we conducted a Phase 1 trial (EVO-002) examining the ability of a single vaginal administration of the vaginal gel at three different doses to reduce vaginal pH. The trial was completed in late 2016 and revealed that the highest dose of the MPT vaginal gel (5-gram) reduced vaginal pH for up to seven days following a single administration compared to placebo gel or no gel. We are currently designing a Phase 2b/3 trial to examine the ability of a 5-gram dose of our MPT vaginal gel product candidate compared to placebo gel to reduce recurrent BV over a 16-week intervention period. 
 Commercialization Strategy 
 We intend to implement a global strategy to commercialize Amphora. In the United States, our plan is to build our own integrated sales and marketing infrastructure. Outside of the United States, we expect to leverage global pharmaceutical companies or other qualified potential partners to license commercialization rights or enter collaborations for the commercialization and distribution of Amphora. 
 While awaiting the decision from the FDA as to the approval of Amphora, we plan to conduct pre-commercialization activities including: 
  
• | the selection of commercial suppliers, which includes agency of record for the Amphora brand, hiring of sales and sales support personnel to support the anticipated Amphora launch, initiation of payer programs including the addition of medical science liaisons and national/key account managers, and the selection of third-party logistic provider(s); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the optimization of manufacturing capabilities to include the installation of new equipment into manufacturers’ facilities, planning and preparing for all requisite inspections, planning for process validation and registration batch quantities, and establishing secondary (back-up) manufacturing capability.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

United States 
 We estimate that the U.S. market is the largest commercial opportunity for our product candidates. If Amphora is approved for commercialization by the FDA, we intend to establish a commercial sales force to market Amphora directly to obstetricians and gynecologists, or OB/GYNs, who write the majority of prescriptions for contraceptive products. 
 The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or ACOG, reports there are approximately 36,000 fellows currently practicing in the United States. However, the top 30% of this group represents 85% of the contraceptive prescription volume. We intend to target the top 30% by deploying a sales force of approximately 85 sales representatives. Our direct sales force will be complemented by print and digital advertising, social media campaigns, access programs, educational campaigns, and non-personal promotion campaigns targeting both consumers and healthcare providers. 
 Successful prescription drug market launches require comprehensive and integrated pre-launch activities. During the pre-launch phase for Amphora, we intend to assemble an experienced team of key account managers and medical science liaisons expected to focus on ensuring key payer accounts, pharmacy benefit managers, key opinion leaders and medical associations who are educated about the need to offer a wider set of options to women seeking non-hormonal, woman-controlled contraceptive methods. We expect these educational activities will be supported by presentation of clinical data at key national congresses (such as the ACOG and the Society of Family Planning), clinical publications, and additional market development activities. Launch and post-launch commercial activities are expected to include multi-channel marketing campaigns to raise brand awareness, including direct to consumer and health care professional campaigns. These key initiatives will be supported by awareness campaigns in social media, online and print advertisements, paid and earned social 
 
14

media support, and public relations efforts. We expect these campaigns to encourage patients to consult their healthcare providers and ensure payer and healthcare provider strategies are implemented. 
 Ex-U.S. Markets 
 In markets outside of the United States, if a product candidate is approved for marketing in an individual market, we intend to establish regional and/or global partnerships by either sublicensing the commercialization rights or to entering into distribution agreements with one or more third parties for the commercialization of the applicable product candidate in that market. 
 Payer and Reimbursement Strategy 
 United States 
 We have conducted market research with 45 different healthcare plans that cover approximately 70% of covered lives within the United States to better understand viable access and pricing strategies for Amphora. Overall, a majority of respondents were positive about the introduction of a new contraceptive method. These respondents cited the many unintended pregnancies, high costs associated with unwanted pregnancies, and the underlying limitations in the contraceptive category (i.e. the lack of non-hormonal options) as reasons a new contraceptive option is desirable. We aim to have approximately 60% of all commercial healthcare plans offering full access and complete coverage of Amphora for all their reproductive aged women’s lives they are managing at the end of the first year of commercialization of Amphora. This coverage is expected to build to approximately 85% to 90% at peak sales. 
 Pricing strategy 
 Overall, healthcare plans appear receptive to the idea of pricing Amphora like that of branded oral contraceptives. Healthcare plans interviewed during market research expected Amphora to be priced between $100 to $200 for a monthly supply of a 12-applicator box (comparable to branded contraceptives), believing Amphora would ultimately offset other costs the payer may incur (i.e. unwanted pregnancies). 
 Third-party Payers 
 We expect any sales of our product candidates will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the applicable product candidates will be covered by healthcare plans, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid. The process for determining whether a healthcare plan will provide coverage for a product is separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate the plan will pay for the product once coverage is approved. We are also aware many healthcare plans may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all the approved products for a particular indication. We intend to target those healthcare plans managing the largest number of covered lives to achieve optimal access for our product portfolio. 
 In March 2010, the ACA became law with the goals of broadening access to health insurance, reducing or constraining the growth of healthcare spending, enhancing remedies against fraud and abuse, adding new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries and imposing additional health policy reforms. The ACA mandates that certain preventative services that have strong scientific evidence of health benefits, including contraception, must be fully covered and reimbursement plans may no longer require a patient co-payment, coinsurance or deductible (i.e., no patient out-of-pocket expenses) for these services when they are delivered by an in-network provider. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, including the contraceptive coverage mandate. Congress and President Trump have expressed their intentions to repeal or replace the ACA. The President has issued at least one Executive Order and both chambers of Congress passed bills all with the goal of fulfilling these intentions. If full or partial repeal of the ACA is enacted, many if not all of the provisions of the ACA may no longer apply. 
 European Union 
 In our market research, it was found that EU consumers were interested in the unique benefits of Amphora product profiles, especially since Amphora is non-hormonal. Contraceptive products are not reimbursed in all the EU member countries. For example, in Italy there is no coverage for contraceptives, in France and Spain, only oral contraceptives are generally covered, and in Germany, individual reimbursement policies apply. 
 Pricing and reimbursement 
 In the EU, pricing and reimbursement strategies vary widely from country to country. Some countries mandate that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed, while others may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of 
 
15

medicinal products for human use. EU member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of offering a drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense, creating increasingly high barriers for entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from lower-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Therefore, the development of new drug launch strategies has become very challenging to meet both patient need/demand while ensuring products are commercially viable in those markets. 
 Amphora Manufacturing 
 We intend to outsource the manufacturing of Amphora (and our other potential product candidates) to third parties. Currently, we have contracted with Swiss-American CDMO, LLC in Carrollton, Texas, or Swiss-American, to manufacture our clinical supplies of Amphora. Swiss-American has agreed to manufacture Amphora and potential other product candidates in accordance with cGMP regulations, as well as in compliance with all applicable laws and other relevant regulatory agency requirements for manufacture of pharmaceutical drug products. 
Competition 
 As shown below, the contraception market was established in 1960 with the introduction of “the pill,” the first oral contraceptive widely available to women in the U.S. This high-dose hormonal option remained the primary form of available contraception on the market until 1988 when the copper IUD was introduced, offering the first non-hormonal option for birth control. As shown in the time line below, there was no notable innovation providing additional options in women’s reproductive health until 30 years after the introduction of “the pill,” when pharmaceutical companies introduced synthetic hormonal products with different hormonal delivery systems, including the hormonal IUD, implants, the patch, and vaginal ring. 
 

If approved, Amphora would compete for market share in at least four categories: 1) oral contraception, 2) Long-Acting Reversible Contraception, or LARC, comprised of IUDs, implants, and injectables, 3) short-term non-oral contraceptives, comprised of the weekly or monthly synthetic hormonal options including the patch and vaginal ring, and 4) over-the-counter, or OTC, methods, dominated primarily by the condom. 
 Oral Contraceptives (the “pill”) 
 The pill is the most commonly used form of birth control in the U.S. today. Birth control pills are marketed under a variety of brand names. There are two main kinds of oral contraceptives — combination birth control pills, which contain estrogen and progestin, and the “mini pill”, which contains only progestin. Oral contraceptives typically must be taken on a regular or daily basis in order to be effective. 
 LARC 
 Implants 
 The contraception implant (principally marketed in the United States as Nexplanon® by a subsidiary of Merck & Co.), which must be implanted under the skin and removed by a qualified healthcare provider, requiring a medical procedure, provides contraception by releasing hormones over a three-year period. The implant has realized an increase in market share over the past five years, outpacing the overall contraceptive category year-over-year, with annual sales in the United States of approximately $141 million. 
Injectables 
 The primary injectable hormonal contraceptive on the market is Depo-Provera® offered by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Each injection provides protection for up to 12 to 14 weeks, but patients must receive injections once every 12 weeks to get full contraceptive protection. Depo Provera was introduced to the market in 1992 and has annual sales in the U.S. of approximately $211 million. 
 
16

IUDs 
 The copper IUD was introduced to the market in 1988 and provides protection by disrupting sperm motility and damaging sperm so that they are prevented from joining with an ovum. Today, the copper IUD is principally marketed by Cooper Surgical, Inc. as Paragard® and has annual sales in the U.S. of approximately $290 million. The hormonal IUD is principally offered under the brand names, Kyleena®, Skyla® and Mirena®, a family of products from Bayer Pharmaceuticals, and has annual sales in the U.S. of approximately $1.2 billion. All IUDs must be inserted or removed by a physician. 
 The LARCs are not dependent on user adherence, thus making this method appealing to those who benefit from a passive form of birth control with no daily requirement to take a pill, however many women have decided to remove their LARC due to the hormonal side effects they experience. 
 Short-term Hormonal, Non-oral 
 Contraceptive Patch 
 The weekly contraceptive patch was introduced in 2000 by Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen division; however, deaths resulting from venous thromboembolism, or VTE, due to hormonal exposure had a significant negative impact on the patch and led to label changes restricting utilization. Following the loss of exclusivity, Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen division exited women’s healthcare and contraception as a promotional category. 
Vaginal Ring 
 The hormonal vaginal ring by Merck & Co. was introduced to the market in 2001 and has annual sales in the U.S. of approximately $650 million. The ring is used for three weeks and then removed for a week during menses and a new hormonal vaginal ring is inserted. The efficacy for the vaginal ring is similar to hormonal oral contraception. Users of the vaginal ring report the same incidence of hormonal related side-effects as those using oral hormonal contraception. 
 Non-prescription Over-the-Counter (OTC) 
 Condoms are the dominate product offering in OTC sales. They are manufactured primarily by Trojan® (Church & Dwight) and Durex® (Reckitt Benckiser) brands, with approximately six million women who depend on condom use as their only method of birth control. The market size in the U.S. for male condoms in 2016 was over $900 million.

The adoption of Amphora, if approved, is expected to come equally from each category discussed, as interest in Amphora falls into two distinct segments: 1) those women seeking an alternative to hormonal contraception; and 2) those women who are expected to utilize Amphora as added protection to their current form of birth control. Our market research has indicated that the hormone-free, on demand, woman-controlled aspect of Amphora makes it an attractive option across the entire competitive set. 
 Rush License 
 As discussed above, we entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement with Rush University, dated March 27, 2014, or the Rush License Agreement, pursuant to which Rush University granted us an exclusive, worldwide license of certain patents and know-how, or the Rush Licensed IP, related to our MPT vaginal gel authorizing us to make, distribute and commercialize products and processes for any and all therapeutic, prophylactic and/or diagnostic uses, including, without limitation, use for female vaginal health and/or contraception. 
 As further described in the Rush License Agreement, we are under an obligation to make royalty payments to Rush University based on net sales of products and/or processes that are claimed in the patents or the know-how licensed to us under the Rush License Agreement. To the extent one of our products is not claimed in a licensed patent but does utilize the licensed know-how, the applicable royalty rate to such product and/or processes would be reduced. 
 
17

In addition, if during the three years after one of our products or processes has received regulatory approval and is introduced to the market, if the amounts paid to Rush University as royalties or sublicensing fees do not total a minimum royalty amount, then we must pay a minimum annual royalty to Rush University. If we have to pay a royalty or other payment to a third party in order for us to avoid infringement of third-party rights, we may offset up to 50% owed to such third party by up to 50% of the amounts owed to Rush University under the Rush License. The above-described royalty payments expire upon termination of the Rush License Agreement in accordance with its terms. 
 We also have the right to sub-license our rights to affiliates (without the prior approval of Rush University) and to third parties (with the prior written approval of Rush University, not to be unreasonably delayed or conditioned). To the extent Rush University approves of a third-party sub-license, in lieu of any royalty payment obligation under the Rush License Agreement, we would then be under an obligation to pay Rush University a sub-license fee equal to a percentage of any sublicensing revenue received from any third-party sub-licensee. 
 Pursuant to the Rush License Agreement, Rush University, its affiliates and/or its sublicensees have the right in the form of a royalty free, non-exclusive license from us under the applicable patents and know-how to use the technology embodied by such patents and know-how for non-commercial research purposes. 
 The Rush License Agreement provides that we must use our best efforts to bring one or more products or processes based on the licensed patents to market, and to continue diligent marketing efforts for one or more of such products or processes during the term of the agreement. Additionally, within one month of the end of each fiscal quarter until the date of first commercial sale of a product, we must provide Rush University with a written development report summarizing our product development activities since the prior such report, as well as any necessary adjustments to the plan of development. 
 The Rush License Agreement contains additional customary representations and warranties, insurance and confidentiality provisions and is governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, except that questions affecting the licensed patents will be determined in accordance with the national law of the country in which the applicable patent was granted. We have the first right, but not the obligation, to pursue potential infringers of the licensed patents technology and know-how and the prior written approval of Rush University is required to settle any related claim. 
 We have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Rush University, its employees and certain other related parties from and against any and all liabilities, damages, settlements, penalties, fines, costs or expenses arising out of any claim, complaint, suit, proceeding or cause of action brought against the relevant indemnity by a third party alleging damage arising from or occurring as a result of the activities performed by or under the authority of us, our affiliates or sub-licensees in connection with the exercise of our licenses and rights under the Rush License Agreement, except to the extent caused by Rush University’s negligence or willful misconduct. 
 Unless terminated in accordance with its terms, the term of the Rush License Agreement continues until the expiration, revocation or invalidation of the last of the patents or the abandonment of the last patent application included within the licensed patents and technology, which includes any patent claiming an improvement made within the term of the Rush License Agreement in the course of research supported or developed by Rush University utilizing the technology. 
 The Rush License Agreement may be terminated upon mutual written consent of both parties or by a non-breaching party if the other party commits a breach or default of any covenant in the agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of such breach or default. 
 If we are in default of our obligations under the Rush License Agreement and such default has not been cured within thirty (30) days, Rush University has the option to: (a) terminate the Rush License Agreement; or (b) convert the exclusive license to a non-exclusive license (subject to the rights of any pre-approved sub-licensee under any pre-approved sub-license). Termination of the Rush License Agreement or conversion to a non-exclusive license shall give Rush University the right to terminate all sub-licenses granted by us that were not approved by Rush University. If Rush University declines to terminate any such sub-license agreement (or such sub-license agreement was approved by Rush University) then: (a) in the case of termination of the Rush License Agreement, the sub-license agreement shall become a direct agreement between Rush University and the relevant sub-licensee; and (b) in the case of conversion of the Rush License Agreement license to a non-exclusive license, such license shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. 
 In addition, Rush University may terminate the agreement: (i) upon thirty (30) days’ notice in the event that the aggregate royalties paid under such agreement in any calendar year following March 27, 2017 do not equal a minimum of at least $50,000, except that we may pay to Rush University the difference between the royalties actually paid and $50,000 to prevent Rush University from so terminating the Rush License Agreement, and under such circumstances the Rush License Agreement will continue for an additional two (2) years beyond March 27, 2017; and (ii) in a given country as regards our rights in such country, upon sixty (60) days’ notice if, prior to March 27, 2022, we have not, in such country, engaged in certain specified activities in such country in an effort to exploit the products and processes covered by the licensed patents and technology in such country.

Intellectual Property 
 We believe we have a strong and growing intellectual property portfolio. We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates, and their methods of use, as well as any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions. We also may rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 
 Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, and other intellectual property rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We will also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 As of February 2018, regarding our MPT technology, we own or have exclusively licensed approximately 27 issued patents and allowed applications in the U.S. and other countries and jurisdictions, and have approximately 29 applications pending in the U.S. and other countries and jurisdictions. Furthermore, we own two pending Patent Cooperation Treaty applications that can be converted into national stage applications in U.S. and other countries and jurisdictions.
 We have an exclusive worldwide license to a portfolio of licensed patents held by Rush University, which provide general protection for Amphora, which expire in 2021 and could be eligible for extensions to at least 2024 in the United States and to 2026 in certain European jurisdictions, if granted by those regulatory bodies. Further, we solely own multiple patent families relating to the composition and therapeutic use of Amphora, which, upon grant, would expire at the earliest in 2033. We believe that our licensed and solely owned non-hormonal contraceptive gel patent filings, combined with our substantial know-how in this field, will continue to provide opportunities for us to establish a significant barrier to competitor entry into the market. 
 In addition, as Amphora is a product that acts locally in the vagina, we believe that a generic version of Amphora gel cannot be evaluated for bioequivalence with the comparative pharmacokinetic blood testing that is commonly used to establish bioequivalence of systemic generic drugs. The comparative clinical endpoint studies that are generally conducted to establish bioequivalence of a locally-acting generic drug would not likely be adequately sensitive for detecting differences in performance between the generic drug and its reference listed drug. 
 In addition to patents, we expect to rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive positions. For example, certain aspects of the composition, manufacturing, and use of Amphora are protected by unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Although trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect we seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, collaborators, and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets and know-how may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by third parties in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting intellectual property, including trade secret, know-how and inventions. 
 Trademark Basics and Strategy 
 We own or have rights to various trademarks, copyrights and trade names used in our business, including Evofem and Amphora. Our logos and trademarks are the property of Evofem Biosciences, Inc. All other brand names or trademarks appearing in this report are the property of their respective holders. Our use or display of other parties’ trademarks, trade dress, or products in this report is not intended to, and does not, imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us, by the trademark or trade dress owners. 
Healthcare Laws and Regulations 
 Healthcare providers and third-party payers play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payers and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: 
 Anti-Kickback Statute — the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, among other things, prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federally funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate the statute in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that 
 
19

includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act; 
 False Claims Act — the federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower and qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 — the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or for making any false statements relating to healthcare matters; as in the case of the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statutes, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate the statute in order to have committed a violation; 
 False Statements Statute — the federal False Statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 
 Stark Law — the federal ban on physician self-referrals, which prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing certain “designated health services” if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has any financial relationships with the entity; 
 Sunshine Act — the federal transparency or “sunshine” requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services, or the DHHS, information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests; 
State Transparency Laws 
 Some U.S. state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to healthcare providers and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and to track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration provided to physicians, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information. 
State and Foreign Regulatory Concerns 
 Analogous State and foreign laws and regulations, such as State Anti-Kickback and False Claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payers, including private insurers. 
 State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 United States — FDA Process 
 The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDA warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution. Medical products containing a combination of new drugs, biological products or medical devices are regulated as “combination products” in the United States. A combination product generally is defined as a product comprised of components from two or more regulatory categories (e.g., drug/device, device/biologic, drug/biologic). Each component of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component, whether a new drug, biologic or device. To facilitate pre-market review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the pre-market review and regulation of the overall product based upon a determination by the FDA of the primary mode of action of the combination product. Amphora is subject to review by the FDA, and it is anticipated that Amphora will be a drug/device combination product under NDA standards.

 Amphora may not be marketed in the United States until the product has received FDA approval. The steps to be completed before a drug may be marketed in the United States include: 

• | pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication to the FDA’s satisfaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials in the U.S. may begin and is required to be updated annually. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. Our first IND submitted in 2011 relates to Amphora for the prevention of pregnancy (AMP001). Our second IND relates to the MPT vaginal gel for the prevention of recurrent BV (EVO-002). We have also been allowed to conduct a clinical trial relating to prevention of urogenital chlamydia and gonorrhea (AMPREVENCE) under this IND, and the first subject was enrolled in this trial on January 23, 2018. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials necessary for product approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. The trial protocol and informed consent information for trial subjects in clinical trials must also be approved by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each institution where the trials will be conducted, and each IRB must monitor the trial until completion. Trial subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive good clinical practice regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information. 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Section 505(b)(1) and Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA are the provisions governing the type of NDAs that may be submitted under the FDCA. Section 505(b)(1) is the traditional pathway for new chemical entities when no other new drug containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredient or active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance, has been approved by the FDA. As an alternate pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations of previously approved products, a company may file a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The FDA reviews any NDA submitted to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before the FDA accepts the NDA for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the NDA for filing. Even if the NDA is filed, companies cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may also refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. We submitted our NDA for Amphora on July 2, 2015 via the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. No advisory committee was convened by the FDA on the first-round review and no advisory committee is expected upon resubmission of our NDA. 
 The FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, or may condition the approval of an NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.

Post-Approval Requirements 
 Oftentimes, even after a drug has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA may require that certain post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical trials. If such post-approval conditions are not satisfied, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. In addition, holders of an approved NDA are required to (i) report certain adverse reactions to the FDA, (ii) comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products, and (iii) continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP regulations after approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing facilities. This latter effort includes assessment of ongoing compliance with cGMP regulations. We have used and intend to continue to use third-party manufacturers to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients for our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and for final, finished product, and future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, including withdrawal of the product from the market. 
 Hatch-Waxman Act 
 As part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA was enacted, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit the applicant to rely upon certain pre-clinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, which is referred to as the Reference Listed Drug, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any listed patents in the FDA’s Orange Book publication that relate to the Reference Listed Drug. Specifically, the applicant must certify for all listed patents one of the following certifications: (i) the required patent information has not been filed by the original applicant; (ii) the listed patent already has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a specified date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the new product. 
 If a Paragraph I or II certification is filed, the FDA may make approval of the application effective immediately upon completion of its review. If a Paragraph III certification is filed, the approval may be made effective on the patent expiration date specified in the application, although a tentative approval may be issued before that time. If an application contains a Paragraph IV certification, a series of events will be triggered, the outcome of which will determine the effective date of approval of the 505(b)(2) application. The Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the Referenced Listed Drug has expired. 
 A certification that the new product will not infringe the Reference Listed Drug’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders for the Reference Listed Drug once the applicant’s NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a legal challenge to the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of their receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA by imposing a 30-month automatic statutory injunction, which may be shortened by the court in a pending patent case if either party fails to reasonably cooperate in expediting the case. The 30-month stay terminates if a court issues a final order determining that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. Alternatively, if the listed patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, the applicant’s NDA will not be subject to the 30-month stay. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments provide five years of data exclusivity for new chemical entities which prevents the FDA from accepting Abbreviated New Drug Applications and 505(b)(2) applications containing the protected active ingredient. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also provide three years of exclusivity for applications containing the results of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) essential to the FDA’s approval of new uses of approved products such as new indications, delivery mechanisms, dosage forms, strengths, or conditions of use. 
 Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Sales of products that we may market in the future, and our ability to generate revenues on such sales, are dependent, in significant part, on the availability and level of reimbursement from third-party payers such as state and federal governments, managed care providers and private insurance plans. If our products are approved by the FDA, we intend to work with payers to demonstrate the clinical benefits of our products over other delivery modalities to secure adequate and commercially favorable pricing and reimbursement levels.

Other Governmental Regulations, Healthcare Laws and Environmental Matters 
 The FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for products under its jurisdiction both prior to and after approval. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or the PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA has indicated that Amphora is covered by the PREA, but the FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of an applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. We have requested a partial waiver of the PREA in our NDA. 
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal fraud and abuse laws such as anti-kickback statutes, physician self-referral prohibitions, and false claims laws, privacy and security, and the Sunshine Act, many of which may become more applicable to us if our product candidates are approved for commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to it, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
 If we establish international operations, we will be subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We also may be implicated under the FCPA for activities by our partners, collaborators, contract research organizations, vendors or other agents. 
 Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements involving exclusive license rights, if any, or acquisitions, if any, may be subject to national or supranational antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted. 
 Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union 
 We are currently assessing how Amphora is going to be regulated in the EU and expect that Amphora is going to be regulated as a drug. Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of an EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial applications must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 
 To obtain marketing approval of a drug in the EU, an applicant must submit a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all EU member states, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. 
 The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in specific EU member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any EU member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for an applicant to apply to one member state to assess the application (the reference member state) and specifically list other member states in which it wishes to obtain approval (concerned member states). Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labelling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and each concerned member state. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application which is then reviewed and approved commented on by the concerned member states. Within 90 days 
 
23

of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. 
 In the EU, only products for which marketing authorizations have been granted may be promoted. Even if authorized, prescription-only medicines may only be promoted to healthcare professionals, not the general public. All promotion should be in accordance with the particulars listed in the summary of product characteristics. Promotional materials must also comply with various laws, and codes of conduct developed by pharmaceutical industry bodies in the EU which govern (amongst other things) the training of sales staff, promotional claims and their justification, comparative advertising, misleading advertising, endorsements, and (where permitted) advertising to the general public. Failure to comply with these requirements could lead to the imposition of penalties by the competent authorities of the EU member states. The penalties could include warnings, orders to discontinue the promotion of the medical device, seizure of promotional materials, fines and possible imprisonment. 
 Emerging Growth Company 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, (3) the day we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as measured as of each June 30th, and (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. We refer to the Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act of 2012 herein as the “JOBS Act,” and references herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
As long as we remain an “emerging growth company,” we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and financial statements in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote to approve executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of one or more of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.”
