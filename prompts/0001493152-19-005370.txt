ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview of Our Business
 
Recent Developments
 
The Company’s core business strategy is to utilize its proprietary DNA profiling artificial intelligence (AI) to meet the growing demands of targeted market segments. Specifically, to provide precision medicine recommendations including medical cannabis use analysis, consumer wellness, nutraceutical analysis, and in due course pharmaceuticals. This will be delivered through telehealth, managed care facilities and hospital systems.
 
Frelii continues to develop and grow its patented AI technology named “NAVII”, leveraging base code and large data sets gathered from public and private partnerships. Frelii’s predictive capacity with its precision medicine and health and wellness AI has increased from 84% to 98.5%. The flagship high-efficiency Genetic Sequencing and analysis using Frelii’s proprietary technology has increased to greater than 99% and 99.999% accuracy on whole genome and exome sequencing, respectively. Current competitive solutions analyze approximately 400 thousand data points, generating approximately 384 outcomes, such as diet suggestions or identification of potential health risks. The Frelii AI technology has dramatically increased the data points analyzed to over 3.2 billion, yielding more than 60 million outcomes.
 
Due to this continued expansion of its AI and market segment specific UI, Frelii has been able to create negotiations with institutions and organizations in each target market segment that will allow the Company to maximize its business development, strategic growth and revenue for the foreseeable future. The Company’s unique technology is particularly attractive to these select segments because of the fundamentally different approach Frelii takes using AI to interpret DNA testing results. This will allow each roadmap market segment to have much greater insight and decision-making perspective than what is currently available, creating greater competitive advantage for each partner and alliance within their own respective markets.
 
Attention will still be given to the company’s consumer offerings; however, the consistently expanding and growing capabilities make Frelii’s offerings significant to expanded markets in the following ways:
 
Precision Medicine and Health Prediction
 

● | Because Frelii conducts whole-genosequencing, its technology can be leveraged to advance precision medicine when used for disease treatment and prevention by taking into consideration an individual patient’s complete genome with more than 60 million outcomes. Medical professionals and researchers will be able to more accurately predict and provide treatment strategies. This includes:

o | Precision Medicine for Medical Cannabis Use. In states where medical cannabis is legal and in Canada, the application of NAVII can be used to help medical professionals determine the best or most appropriate plant genetics and dose to use with patients based on the patient’s genetic information. The Frelii technology has the potential to greatly impact how medical cannabis is used for medicinal purposes making treatment safer, kinder and faster.

o | Precision Medicine for Consumer Wellness. Our web platform provides subscribers an individualized health analysis that identifies their most significant health risks and generates preventative action plans based on their individual blood markers, genetics and lifestyle. Subscribers who have previously received genetic health information from 23andMe will be able to provide their login information, and our site will upload that data to the algorithm, which will automatically adjust patient protocols. Our personalized wellness programs feature nutrition and fitness plans, supplement recommendations, downloadable menus, recipes, and shopping lists, and virtual personal training. In the near future, we plan to offer our subscribers the opportunity to enhance their personalized wellness plans by uploading their 23andMe or Ancestry.com raw genetic data, or by ordering lab diagnostic kits for more comprehensive health testing and analysis. Customers can also order premium nutritional and vitamin supplements from our online health marketplace. We plan to generate revenues through user subscriptions, lab diagnostic kit purchases, sales of compounding pharmacy products, and nutritional supplements. Frelii plans to offer corporate wellness organizations the opportunity to enhance their personalized wellness plans by ordering lab diagnostic kits for more comprehensive blood testing and analysis.

● | Distribution will be focused on various Medical Systems. The Company’s technology and its application to diagnostic, health risk identification and precision medicine could improve health care and lower costs of health providers. Health providers will use the Company’s technology to identify risks before symptoms or complaints arise, when such health issues could be addressed more efficiently and potentially more cost-effectively. This will include Managed Care Facilities and Hospital Networks delivered face to face or within telemedicine.

Corporate History
 
The Company incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 5, 2002, under the name “Bayview Corporation.” From 2005 until 2009, the Company’s business involved researching and developing cancer treatment drugs. From July 2009 until May 2011, the Company operated as a real estate services firm, seeking to capitalize on the real estate opportunities resulting from the dislocation in the credit markets, and by extension, the multifamily housing market, by acquiring, rehabilitating, stabilizing and selling distressed multifamily properties in the southern United States, predominantly in Texas. On May 26, 2011, the Company changed its name to Vican Resources, Inc., and changed its business model when it sold the real estate services division and acquired all of the outstanding shares of Vican Trading, Inc., a Montreal-based purchaser and seller of metals, ores, and other commodities (hereafter, “Vican Trading”). Upon the acquisition of Vican Trading, there was an implied option for either party to rescind the original acquisition. During the year that option was exercised, and on December 20, 2011, the Company again changed its business when it unwound the acquisition of Vican Trading and acquired all of the assets of Med Ex Direct, Inc., a Florida-based provider of management services in respect of the distribution of diabetic supplies, principally to Hispanic patients (hereafter, “Med Ex Florida”). On March 22, 2012, the Company again changed its business to become an oil & gas exploration, development, and distribution company, unwound the purchase of the assets of Med Ex Florida, and acquired an interest in two oil & gas wells located in Jefferson County, Mississippi.
 
In April 2017, the Company underwent a change of control whereby our current Chief Executive Officer Ian Jenkins acquired a controlling interest in the Company’s capital stock and was appointed our sole officer and director. On April 11, 2017, the Company executed a Share Exchange Agreement with Unprescribed, LLC, later amended to include Cornerstone Medical LLC, whereby the Company, among other terms, agreed to exchange shares with the ownership units of those two entities for 25,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. The Share Exchange Agreement, as amended, terminated by its own terms on December 31, 2017. Following the termination of the Share Exchange Agreement, management modified its business plan to acquire certain intellectual property assets and engage a new executive team to launch its new business as a medical technology company that uses gene sequencing and artificial intelligence to determine risk and lifestyle modifications. The Company’s technology analyzes the most comprehensive markers (3,200,000,000+) on the market to date with over 60 million outcomes. Our technology generates accurate and profoundly valuable insight into DNA. It opens opportunities never before realized in health care, precision medicine, pharmaceutical research, corporate wellness as well as personal health and risk identification.
