Cipherloc Marketing
 
The foundation of modern security relies on encryption technology to protect sensitive information and maintain user privacy. However, modern encryption algorithms are “broken” – the massive amounts of computing horsepower available today have compromised existing algorithms and made them susceptible to attacks. Cipherloc is a data security solutions company. Our innovative technology can be used to overcome the flaws and inadequacies associated with today’s encryption algorithms in order to fully and securely protect the world’s data.

In an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business, we may make “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements usually relate to future events and anticipated revenues, earnings, cash flows or other aspects of our operations or operating results. As indicated previously, forward-looking statements are often identified by words, “will”, “may”, “should”, “continue”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “expect”, “plan”, “forecast”, “project”, “estimate”, “intend” and words of similar nature. Forward-looking statements generally include statements containing:
 

● | projections about accounting and finances; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | plans and objectives for the future; 
● | projections or estimates about assumptions relating to our performance; or 
● | our opinions, views or beliefs about the effects of current or future events, circumstances or performance. 

 
You should view those statements with caution. Those statements are not guarantees of future performance, circumstances or events. They are based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the date the statements are made. All phases of our business are subject to uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of which we do not control. Any of these factors either alone or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on us and could change whether any forward-looking statement ultimately turns out to be true. Additionally, we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of future events, circumstances or developments.
