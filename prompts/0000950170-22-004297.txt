OVERVIEW
We are a pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products that have the potential to optimize the delivery of infused therapies, advance patient care and reduce healthcare costs. Our strategy is designed to enable the subcutaneous administration of therapies that have previously been limited to intravenous, or IV, delivery. By moving delivery away from the high-cost healthcare settings typically required for IV administration, we believe our technology has the potential to reduce overall healthcare costs and advance the quality and convenience of care. Our lead product candidate, FUROSCIX, consists of our novel formulation of furosemide delivered via an on-body infusor and is under development for treatment of congestion in patients with worsening heart failure who display reduced responsiveness to oral diuretics and do not require hospitalization.
We resubmitted our new drug application, or NDA, for FUROSCIX, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on June 30, 2020. The resubmission was a response to a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA with respect to our NDA submitted in August 2017, which indicated that, among other things, certain device modifications to our infusor were required. Based on our interactions with the FDA prior to our June 30, 2020 resubmission, we decided to transition to our next generation device. The resubmission incorporated our next generation device which is being developed through a partnership with West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc., or West, using its proprietary on-body infusor.
 On July 23, 2020, the FDA accepted the resubmission of our NDA and we were given a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date of December 30, 2020; however, on December 3, 2020, we received a second CRL from the FDA, in which, among other things, the FDA raised questions related to testing, labeling and features of the combination product unrelated to the drug constituent. The FDA also indicated that they needed to conduct pre-approval inspections at certain of our third-party manufacturing facilities. No clinical deficiencies were noted. On January 28, 2021, we had a Type A meeting with the FDA to discuss the issues described in the CRL and steps required for the resubmission of the FUROSCIX NDA. On June 2, 2021, we had a Type C meeting with the FDA regarding the requirements for resubmission of the FUROSCIX NDA. Based on the guidance we received during these meetings and subsequently contained within the meeting minutes, we conducted the required bench testing for the West proprietary on-body infusor. We anticipate the FDA will still need to conduct pre-approval inspections at certain of our third-party manufacturing facilities. We recently elected to change packaging vendors, which necessitated minor modifications to our FUROSCIX NDA. As a result, we anticipate resubmitting our NDA by April 15, 2022.

Heart failure affects 6.5 million adults in the United States and this population is expected to grow to greater than 8.0 million by 2030. Our proprietary formulation of furosemide administered subcutaneously via the West proprietary on-body infusor, which we refer to together as FUROSCIX, is intended to help alleviate the signs and symptoms associated with congestion due to fluid retention in heart failure patients, such as fatigue and shortness of breath. FUROSCIX is designed to offer alternative outpatient intervention for heart failure patients who display reduced responsiveness to oral diuretics in non-emergency situations and do not require hospitalization.
We believe FUROSCIX, if approved by the FDA, would allow heart failure patients to receive IV-strength diuresis outside the high-cost hospital setting. Prevention of hospital admission and reduced readmission rates would result in reducing the estimated 15 million days patients with heart failure spend in the hospital each year. By decreasing the number of admissions and readmissions to hospitals, we believe we can drive significant cost savings to payers and hospitals.
We are leveraging our subcutaneous formulation expertise to develop additional product candidates that we believe can significantly decrease the cost of treatment by moving treatment away from the hospital setting and can improve patient quality of life by eliminating the need for IV catheters. In this area, we have conducted

additional development work to deliver ceftriaxone, a parenteral cephalosporin that is typically administered intravenously or intramuscularly. Based on IMS Health data, each year in the United States, there are 15 million outpatient days of ceftriaxone therapy to treat various types of infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and Lyme Disease. The current outpatient treatment option for these patients, Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy requires the placement of a long-term venous access device, known as a peripherally inserted central catheter, or PICC, and coordination of home infusion or office-based infusion services for patients to receive antibiotics outside of the hospital, which places significant burdens on the patients. Subcutaneous administration of ceftriaxone represents an opportunity to reduce costs to the overall health care system and improve the quality of care by reducing the complications and serious health risks associated with IV catheters and increasing patient mobility and convenience. We have conducted a pharmacokinetic study with subcutaneous ceftriaxone and intend to conduct additional clinical trials to advance its development.
Beyond furosemide and ceftriaxone, we aim to leverage our subcutaneous formulation expertise to develop and seek approval of additional drug candidates. We intend to conduct feasibility work on additional product candidates.
OUR PLATFORM AND OTHER PIPELINE PROGRAMS

FUROSCIX to Treat Congestion in Patients with Heart Failure
 Heart failure is a chronic disease resulting from impairment of the heart’s ability to pump blood and is one of the most common causes of hospital admissions in patients over 65 with at least 1-2 million hospitalizations in the United States annually. Patients with heart failure are prone to retain sodium and water in their blood stream and, as this accumulates, it can distribute to tissues. This extra fluid settling in the lungs, ankles and abdomen can cause symptoms ranging from weight gain, mild swelling and shortness of breath while walking to more severe symptoms, such as weakness, severe fatigue and difficulty breathing when sitting or lying down. Congestion is the most common cause of hospitalization for patients with heart failure.
 Oral loop diuretics, such as furosemide, are the mainstay for the management and prevention of congestion in patients with heart failure. However, during periods of worsening congestion in heart failure, the bioavailability of oral furosemide is reduced and becomes highly variable. To overcome the limitation of oral furosemide in this setting, two strategies are typically employed. First, the furosemide dose is typically doubled, and/or additional oral diuretics (thiazide diuretics) are incorporated to attempt to overcome the blunted pharmacological response to these agents. Second, if this fails, clinicians often rely on giving IV diuretics, either in the hospital, an outpatient heart failure clinic or an infusion center, if available. Approximately 800,000 patients with symptoms of heart failure are admitted to the hospital by an emergency physician annually and we believe 50% of these admissions may be potentially avoided if patients could receive timely, effective treatment for symptomatic congestion outside of the hospital setting.
In addition to potentially unnecessary hospitalizations, it has been estimated that up to 50% of patients hospitalized for an episode of acute decompensated heart failure are discharged on oral diuretics with persistent signs and symptoms of congestion. The presence of congestion at discharge has been associated with an increased risk of 30-day all-cause mortality and rehospitalization for heart failure. The American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association Task Force on Practice guidelines recommend that patients hospitalized for heart failure have a post discharge follow up visit within 14 days of hospital discharge. Since symptoms of congestion generally worsen over several days or weeks, patients with heart failure could receive FUROSCIX at the first signs and symptoms of congestion, when the response to oral diuretics is not adequate.
Therefore, FUROSCIX may potentially offer an alternative outpatient route of administration of furosemide for heart failure patients to alleviate the signs and symptoms associated with congestion when responsiveness to oral diuretics is reduced and hospitalization is not indicated in order to potentially avoid unnecessary hospitalizations.
FUROSCIX is our novel formulation of furosemide contained in a pre-filled, Crystal Zenith® cartridge and self- administered subcutaneously via a single-use, disposable and wearable on-body delivery system. The user inserts the pre-filled cartridge into the wearable device, secures it to the abdomen via a medical-grade adhesive, and a subcutaneous infusion of FUROSCIX is administered through a pre-programmed, biphasic delivery profile with 30 mg administered over the first hour, followed by 12.5 mg per hour for the subsequent 4 hours (a total dose of 80 mg (10 mL) over 5 hours).
We believe that, if approved, FUROSCIX has the potential to provide a safe and effective solution that will enable IV-strength diuresis outside of the high-cost hospital setting. We believe FUROSCIX can potentially reduce the

estimated 15 million days per year that heart failure patients spend in the hospital and thus reduce overall health care costs by decreasing both admissions and readmissions.
Subcutaneous FUROSCIX has the potential to:

•Reduce hospital admission rates: Since symptoms of congestion generally worsen over several days or weeks, there is a window of opportunity to intervene. We believe FUROSCIX, if approved, could in certain instances avoid a hospitalization by providing IV-strength diuresis in an outpatient setting such as the physician’s office, a heart failure clinic or at home. It is estimated that 90% of patients presenting to the emergency department with worsening heart failure are admitted to the hospital and approximately 50% of those patients could potentially be safely discharged after demonstrating effective diuresis with parenteral therapy during a brief period of observation. 
 •Reduce patient readmission: We believe FUROSCIX, if approved, could reduce the incidence of readmission for heart failure patients by providing IV-strength diuresis in the home post-hospital discharge. It is estimated that 30-50% of patients that are hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure that are transitioned to oral furosemide prior to being discharged from the hospital have persistent symptoms of congestion at discharge. Persistent congestion may reduce the absorption of oral furosemide reducing the diuretic effect. As a result, patients are often readmitted to the hospital to receive IV furosemide. We believe FUROSCIX can break this cycle by providing IV-strength diuresis to patients shortly after discharge to reduce the rate of readmissions for decompensated heart failure. 
 If approved, FUROSCIX may potentially offer an outpatient therapeutic option to deliver IV-strength furosemide to potentially avoid the need for unnecessary, expensive hospitalizations which could improve patients’ quality of life with minimal interruption of daily living.
Clinical Development of FUROSCIX
We are developing FUROSCIX, a drug-device combination product, pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in which we are relying on the FDA’s finding of safety and efficacy for the Listed Drug Furosemide (Injection, USP, 10 mg/mL; NDA 18667; Hospira, Inc.), which is indicated for intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) injection for the treatment of edema in adult patients with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver and renal disease, including nephrotic syndrome. Currently, there are no FDA-approved furosemide products for subcutaneous administration which could provide an alternative route of administration that could be used in the outpatient setting when the response to oral diuretics is not adequate.
 FUROSCIX (Furosemide Injection, 80 mg/10 mL) is a novel, pH neutral formulation of furosemide being developed for administration via a subcutaneous infusion using a proprietary, wearable, pre-programmed on-body drug delivery system. The currently available furosemide injection products are alkaline, with a pH of 8.0 – 9.3. Subcutaneous administration of IV/IM furosemide, USP formulation has been associated with local skin reactions, some severe, requiring discontinuation of treatment and local treatment of the complication which has been attributed to the alkaline pH of the furosemide formulation, volume of fluid administered and the rapid injection. There are currently no furosemide products approved by the FDA for subcutaneous administration.  
We resubmitted our new drug application, or NDA, for FUROSCIX, with the FDA, on June 30, 2020. On July 23, 2020, the FDA accepted the resubmission of our NDA and we were given a PDUFA target action date of December 30, 2020; however, on December 3, 2020, we received a second CRL from the FDA, in which, among other things, the FDA raised questions related to testing, labeling and features of the combination product unrelated to the drug constituent. The FDA also indicated that they needed to conduct pre-approval inspections at certain of our third-party manufacturing facilities. No clinical deficiencies were noted. On January 28, 2021, we had a Type A meeting with the FDA to discuss the issues described in the CRL and steps required for the resubmission of the FUROSCIX NDA. On June 2, 2021, we had a Type C meeting with the FDA regarding the requirements for resubmission of the FUROSCIX NDA. Based on the guidance we received during these meetings and subsequently contained within the meeting minutes, we conducted the required bench testing for the West proprietary on-body infusor. We anticipate the FDA will still need to conduct pre-approval inspections at certain of our third-party manufacturing facilities. We recently elected to change packaging vendors, which necessitated minor modifications to our FUROSCIX NDA. As a result, we anticipate resubmitting our NDA by April 15, 2022.
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Study

We conducted a pivotal, randomized, open-label crossover study from April to September 2015 to assess the relative bioavailability of FUROSCIX in 17 patients with heart failure. In this study, FUROSCIX was delivered subcutaneously via the B. Braun Perfusor Space Infusion Pump. This study also evaluated diuresis and the urinary sodium excretion over eight hours and 24 hours post-dosing as the pharmacodynamic endpoints.
Treatment arms
In this study, the reference treatment was IV furosemide with two bolus injections of 40 mg dosed over two minutes, two hours apart. Our test treatment was FUROSCIX with 80 mg infused subcutaneously, with 30 mg over the first hour followed by 12.5 mg per hour over the subsequent four hours. 
Comparative pharmacokinetic results
This study demonstrated bioequivalence in the concentration of drug delivered over time based upon the area under the curve, or AUC, between our subcutaneous formulation of furosemide and IV furosemide. Although the maximum concentration, or Cmax, of furosemide achieved was four-fold higher with IV injection compared to subcutaneous infusion, the bioavailability of subcutaneous infusion relative to intravenous injection was 99.6%, with a 90% confidence interval of 94.8% to 104.8%, thus meeting the FDA’s defined bioequivalence criteria limit of 80% to 125%. We believe that the difference in Cmax between IV injection and subcutaneous furosemide is attributable to the two bolus IV injections administered at the initiation of IV therapy. Nevertheless, the 5-hour infusion of FUROSCIX resulted in nearly complete bioavailability compared to two bolus IV injections of furosemide.
Comparative pharmacodynamic results
Total mean urine outputs for subcutaneous versus IV administration were 102% (2654 mL vs 2641 mL; p = 0.83) and 103% (3630 mL vs 3538 mL; p = 0.71) at 8 and 24 hours, respectively. Total mean urine sodium excretion for subcutaneous versus IV administration were 97.3% (284 mmol vs 292 mmol; p = 0.78) and 97.4% (341 mmol vs 350 mmol; p = 0.80), at 8 and 24 hours, respectively. The total urine sodium excretion and urine output were comparable between our subcutaneous formulation of furosemide and IV furosemide.
Adhesive Validation Study
 An open label, non-randomized, single-site study was conducted in healthy volunteers to evaluate the effectiveness and local skin tolerability of the 3M 9907W medical tape, the component of the FUROSCIX On-Body Infusor that adheres to the skin of the abdomen to deliver a subcutaneous infusion. After preparation, the device was attached to the skin of the abdomen and a simulated infusion began. At the end of the 5 and 6-hour assessment time points, the devices were ≥ 50% adhered in 100% of the subjects and at both time points, the orange safety latch was not visible on any of the devices. The 3M 9907W medical tape was effective in maintaining the adhesion of the on-body infusor to the skin of the abdomen during a 6-hour wear time and no subjects had a complete device dislodgement of the on-body infusor for FUROSCIX.
Following a 6-hour wear time, 63.2% of the subjects exhibited minimal erythema or no evidence of skin irritation. For those subjects with greater than minimal erythema, these effects were transient: 89.5% exhibited minimal erythema or no evidence of skin irritation when assessed at the 1-hour post device removal. Pain and discomfort were assessed immediately after device removal. Most subjects (60.5%) reported scores of 0 (no pain) or 1 on an 11-point pain scale. The majority of subjects (84.2%) reported no discomfort or mild discomfort upon removal of the device.
 The 3M 9907W medical tape was able to maintain adhesion of the FUROSCIX On-Body Infusor device for the duration of the 6-hour wear time and was generally well tolerated.
 Human Factors Summary
We conducted a human factors validation study for the next generation device from October 21, 2019 to November 14, 2019. The study included 60 subjects made up of 30 heart failure patients, 15 caregivers and 15 healthcare practitioners. Half of the patients were trained, while the remaining patients, all caregivers and all HCPs were untrained.
Participants performed extremely well across all user groups and training conditions. All participants but one successfully setup and started the infusion without experiencing any use errors related to critical tasks which would delay dosing or harm the patient.
 

All participants successfully noticed, identified, and articulated how to respond to an alarm experienced during an infusion without any use errors.

All participants successfully allowed the infusion to carry out, noticed when it completed and performed all steps required to remove and dispose of the on-body infusor without any use errors.

Overall, the study, which was designed to measure eight observational use metrics, across 900 tasks including setup, starting of the infusion, responding to the on-body infusor alarm and finishing the procedure after the infusion demonstrated a user success rate of 99%.
 
Participants also performed well during the knowledge and reading comprehension tasks. Thirty-seven knowledge and comprehension tasks related to critical information were evaluated. Overall, across all 2,220 knowledge and comprehension tasks, participants experienced a user success rate of over 99.5%.

Based on the results from the human factors program, we believe the following:
 
•The FUROSCIX On-Body Infusor and Instructions for Use (IFU) have been successfully validated with the intended user populations (congestive heart failure (CHF) patients, family caregivers, and HCPs) and use cases. 
 •The validation results demonstrate that the FUROSCIX On-Body Infusor and IFU can be safely and effectively used and that performance of critical tasks will not result in patterns of preventable use errors. 
 •After two suggested minor edits to the IFU, all use-related risks for the commercial product will either (a) have been eliminated or (b) consist of acceptable residual risks that cannot be mitigated.
 
FREEDOM-HF - Furoscix Real-World Evaluation for Decreasing Hospital Admissions in Heart Failure

FREEDOM-HF was a health economic study designed to support the commercial reimbursement of FUROSCIX, if approved. Further, this multicenter, prospective adaptive clinical trial was designed to evaluate differences in heart failure and overall costs between subjects receiving FUROSCIX outside the hospital and patients receiving intravenous furosemide in the hospital setting for 30-days after being discharged from the emergency department. Differences in costs were determined from a propensity-matched control arm derived from Truven Health Analytics MarketScan databases. The study was designed to enroll up to 75 subjects in the FUROSCIX cohort to detect a statistically significant difference in 30-day overall and heart-failure related costs. The study began enrollment in the fourth quarter of 2020 and completed enrollment in May 2021.

Based on the results from a planned, prespecified interim analysis conducted to confirm the final sample size, and following input from statisticians, principal investigators, payer advisors and Health Economics and Outcomes Research experts, enrollment was closed on May 17, 2021, prior to the enrollment target of 34 patients. This decision was made due to the statistically significant reduction observed in 30-day heart failure-related costs in patients who received FUROSCIX in the interim analysis. The final analysis included 24 subjects treated with FUROSCIX and 66 matched comparators based on seven variables associated with hospitalization. On July 13, 2021, we announced preliminary top-line results from FREEDOM-HF, demonstrating that average 30-day heart failure-related costs were reduced by $17,753 per study subject in the FUROSCIX arm compared to historically matched comparators (p < 0.0001). In September 2021, we announced additional results from FREEDOM-HF, demonstrating that average 30-day total healthcare costs were reduced by $30,568 per study subject in the FUROSCIX arm compared to historically matched comparators (p < 0.0001). Since the price for FUROSCIX has not been established, the difference in costs does not include the cost of FUROSCIX. These results support our hypothesis that treating heart failure patients presenting to the emergency department with worsening congestion with FUROSCIX outside of the hospital setting has the potential to dramatically reduce the significant costs associated with hospital admissions and readmissions.
    We conducted an analysis of additional secondary endpoints in FREEDOM-HF which provided additional insights into the clinical effectiveness of FUROSCIX. In this analysis, it was determined that patients who received FUROSCIX had a median reduction of heart failure peptide biomarkers from study entry to first visit, and to last

visit, of 42.3% and 28%, respectively (p <0.01). In addition, patients who received FUROSCIX had a 12.8-point improvement in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-12) Summary Score 30 days after study entry.
 
These results have been presented at the Heart Failure Society of America Annual meeting in September 2021 in Denver, Colorado and at the Technology and Heart Failure Therapeutics Conference in February 2022 in New York, NY.
 AT HOME-HF PILOT - Avoiding Treatment in the Hospital with Furoscix for the Management of Congestion in Heart Failure – A Pilot Study
 AT-HOME-HF PILOT is a multicenter, randomized pilot clinical trial designed to evaluate the clinical outcomes and safety of FUROSCIX compared to a “treatment as usual” approach in patients presenting to a heart failure clinic with chronic heart failure and fluid overload requiring augmented diuretic therapy. The primary endpoint is the improvement in a composite/combined morbidity/mortality endpoint consisting of (1) cardiovascular death, (2) heart failure hospitalization, (3) urgent emergency department/clinic visit for worsening heart failure (defined as IV diuretics, augmentation of, or new administration of, metolazone) and (4) NT-proBNP at 30 days using the Finkelstein Schoenfeld method. We anticipate a sample size of 51 subjects (randomized 2:1) could provide additional data on the effectiveness and safety of FUROSCIX and inform a potential clinical trial. The study began enrollment in the second quarter of 2021 and we are expecting to complete enrollment and have data available in the first half of 2022.
 Investigator Sponsored Studies
 We intend to support investigator sponsored studies post-approval and to initiate Phase 4 studies with FUROSCIX, incorporating West's proprietary on-body infusor, to evaluate the efficacy, safety, patient acceptance and health economic outcomes.
Commercialization
If we successfully obtain regulatory approval, we plan to commercialize FUROSCIX in the United States by building and utilizing our own commercial infrastructure. We currently intend to focus our commercial efforts on the United States market, which we believe represents the largest market opportunity for FUROSCIX. In addition, we plan to seek collaborations with third-party partners outside of the United States to distribute our products in foreign markets, if approved by the relevant foreign regulatory authorities.
If approved, we believe that we can effectively commercialize FUROSCIX in the United States with an initial specialty sales force of approximately 35-40 field-based sales representatives. We intend to initially pursue a highly-concentrated target market, which consists of approximately 400 hospitals, associated clinics and office-based practices that, collectively account for approximately 40% of all IV furosemide administered to heart failure patients based on current IMS Drug Distribution Data. We also plan to target the top ten Medicare Part D plans, which cover 80% of Medicare Part D patients. We conducted payer research on 14 payers, representing 22 to 29 million total Medicare lives. We found that reducing readmissions and increasing patient comfort were ranked as important potential attributes of FUROSCIX by the health plans and pharmacy benefit managers that were surveyed.
We intend to build a highly concentrated commercial infrastructure focused on distribution, promotion and customer support to healthcare providers in our key hospital targets and in office-based practices. Our target call points within these hospitals and practices will include heart failure specialists, cardiologists, emergency room doctors and heart failure nurse practitioners. To date, our market research with 309 healthcare professionals has indicated that 93% of our target prescribers would adopt FUROSCIX, if approved, with 80% intending to adopt FUROSCIX in the first six months of product availability. Furthermore, within the prescriber group of heart failure specialists, cardiologists and nurse practitioners that we intend to target at launch, the intent to adopt is 93%, 96% and 94%, respectively, and 89%, 88% and 86%, respectively, of those prescribers intend to adopt in the first six months of product availability. Based on our market research, healthcare professionals perceive the top potential advantages of FUROSCIX, if approved, as the ability to treat in the home setting, prevention of hospitalization, and avoidance of IV placement, while the lowest perceived barriers to adoption identified in the survey were the preference to monitor in a hospital setting, sufficiency of current medications and hospital guidelines or protocols.

In addition, based on a last two patient exercise conducted in our quantitative market research with healthcare professionals, when given the option to change their prior treatment choice to FUROSCIX, if approved, 65% of healthcare practitioners in a clinic setting and 40% in a hospital setting responded that they would prescribe our product candidate. We expect to supplement our sales force with representatives in the medical science, nursing and reimbursement fields to support the proper training and utilization of FUROSCIX.
 As part of our commercialization strategy, we plan to educate hospitals, healthcare practitioners, patients and caregivers of the benefits of FUROSCIX and its proper use. We plan to work with national associations, such as the Heart Failure Society of America and the American Association of Heart Failure Nurses, hospital networks and individual hospitals to update treatment and issue guidelines to include subcutaneous furosemide outpatient treatment plans. These guidelines are intended to provide information to hospitals and healthcare practitioners regarding treatment of outpatient heart failure patients with subcutaneous furosemide.
Patients with heart failure could receive FUROSCIX at the initial worsening signs and symptoms when the response to oral diuretics is not adequate. In addition, patients could receive FUROSCIX after discharge, if they still are exhibiting some signs and symptoms of congestion despite their oral diuretic regimen. We expect to package FUROSCIX, if approved, as individual, single use only on-body infusor kits. In April 2016, we held a meeting with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, at which CMS stated that coverage and reimbursement of FUROSCIX may be available under Medicare Part D as a transition of care drug.
By educating patients on the proper use of FUROSCIX shortly after discharge followed by a face-to-face visit, health care professionals can ensure proper training, initiate treatment at the point of care, and ensure that patients can receive additional days of treatment in the home setting.
 
Our Pipeline Programs
Beyond our initial focus on heart failure, our strategy is to identify and develop additional product candidates where, if approved, could provide effective and convenient subcutaneous therapy that may benefit patients, caregivers and payers.
•FUROSCIX: FUROSCIX is a proprietary furosemide formulation that is buffered to a neutral pH to enable subcutaneous administration via a proprietary wearable, pre-programmed on-body delivery system, based on the West proprietary on-body infusor. It is under development for the treatment of congestion due to volume overload in patients with worsening heart failure who display reduced responsiveness to oral diuretics and do not require hospitalization. We recently elected to change packaging vendors, which necessitated minor modifications to our FUROSCIX NDA. As a result, we anticipate resubmitting our NDA by April 15, 2022. 
 •scCeftriaxone: We have filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, for scCeftriaxone, an antibiotic currently used intravenously for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. To date, we have completed a PK study for scCeftriaxone. We are currently evaluating a suitable on-body delivery system to administer scCeftriaxone. 
 •scCarbapenem: We have completed several IND-enabling studies for our scCarbapenem program, an antibiotic currently used intravenously for the treatment of infections caused by gram-negative organisms. 
 Ceftriaxone
Many patients with an infection requiring IV antibiotics are admitted to the hospital, and a portion of these patients will require subsequent outpatient treatment with IV administration requiring insertion of a PICC line catheter. Ceftriaxone is a parenteral antibiotic commonly used to treat various types of infections, including pneumonia, bone and joint infections, blood stream infections, urinary tract infections and Lyme Disease. According to 2015 data from Arlington Medical Resources, ceftriaxone is the second most utilized antibiotic in the hospital setting and second most utilized IV antibiotic at hospital discharge. Based on Option Care data from August 2016, ceftriaxone represents the largest segment of antibiotics prescribed in the outpatient setting, accounting for 19% of all outpatient prescriptions. Each year, there are approximately 15 million outpatient days of ceftriaxone therapy in the United States based on IMS Health data, with 50% of outpatient ceftriaxone administered to Medicare patients who do not have coverage for home infusion services and frequently must drive to a hospital clinic, emergency room or physician’s office or be admitted to a skilled nursing facility or hospital to receive IV antibiotics. Subcutaneous antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, have the potential to reduce the length of hospital stay

by facilitating transition of care and eliminating the risks of complications from long term IV catheters. Such antibiotics could also enhance convenience and independence of patients and caregivers and potentially reduce the economic burden to payers, particularly in Medicare, by reducing payments for outpatient infusion services.
 After the submission of the IND we conducted a randomized, partially blinded crossover study of 18 patients to evaluate the PK and bioavailability of a commercial formulation of ceftriaxone administered subcutaneously as compared to IV administration. In this study, we observed that the bioavailability of subcutaneous ceftriaxone was 108% of that of IV ceftriaxone. In a PD model based on subcutaneous pharmacokinetics observed in this study, the T>MIC for the first 24 hours for the ceftriaxone 1-gram subcutaneous infusion was observed to be not inferior to the 1-gram IV infusion (98.5% vs 100%). The most common adverse event observed with subcutaneous ceftriaxone administration was pain, with a median pain score of two on a scale of zero to ten (with zero being no pain and ten being the worst possible pain). There were no serious adverse events reported in this study.
We intend to identify a suitable on-body delivery system for the administration of ceftriaxone subcutaneously, conduct additional studies to evaluate optimal delivery for ceftriaxone and to evaluate the skin safety of subcutaneous administration of ceftriaxone.
Additional Product Programs
We are leveraging our know-how for use in other clinical settings where subcutaneous delivery can improve IV treatments to develop a suite of product candidates that, like FUROSCIX, we believe can decrease the cost of treatment by moving treatment out of the hospital setting and eliminating the need for IV catheters. We expect to pursue the development of a subcutaneous carbapenem to treat infections caused by gram-negative infections and have completed initial feasibility work on a potential candidate. We also intend to identify other opportunities where subcutaneous delivery can improve patient treatment and reduce healthcare costs. We intend to evaluate market criteria to systematically choose potential product programs for our pipeline. We plan to look for product candidates that we believe allow us to clearly demonstrate value to patients and the healthcare system and that have large market potential and a concentrated specialty physician prescribing base. We expect to leverage our FUROSCIX sales force to promote additional products that we develop and commercialize.
Our FUROSCIX On-Body Infusor
The FUROSCIX On-Body Infusor is a drug-device combination product consisting of FUROSCIX (furosemide injection, 80 mg per 10 mL), a novel, pH neutral furosemide formulation optimized for subcutaneous administration and contained in a prefilled, Crystal Zenith® cartridge, and a proprietary wearable, pre-programmed on-body delivery system, the FUROSCIX On-Body Infusor, based on West's proprietary on-body infusor. The FUROSCIX On-Body Infusor is applied to the abdomen via a medical grade adhesive and delivers a subcutaneous infusion of FUROSCIX through a pre-programmed, biphasic delivery profile over 5 hours.

MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES
We use a network of qualified suppliers or contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce, manufacture, sterilize and assemble the component parts of our product candidates, including FUROSCIX. Our suppliers produce these component parts to our designs and specifications. Certain processes utilized in the manufacture and test of our product candidates have been verified and validated as required by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. The manufacturing facilities of our suppliers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and certain corresponding state agencies, and we regularly audit our suppliers’ processes to ensure conformity with the specifications, policies and procedures for our product candidates.
We have produced FUROSCIX for use in our clinical trials and stability studies only. We believe that our current third-party manufacturers have capacity for potential commercialization of FUROSCIX, if approved, in quantities sufficient to meet our expected commercial needs, and to accommodate the manufacturing of materials for future clinical trials of other potential product programs that we may identify for our product pipeline.

In order to meet projected global demand for FUROSCIX, if approved, we plan to support an increase in production capacity at West’s and our pharmaceutical manufacturing partners' facilities.
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Proprietary protection
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates, manufacturing and process discoveries and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. We and our partners have been building and continue to build our intellectual property portfolio relating to our product candidates and technology. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also intend to rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us or our partners in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.
Patent rights
Patent life determination depends on the date of filing of the application and other factors as promulgated under the patent laws. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country.

Furosemide 8 mg/mL formulation
As of February 7, 2022, we own a patent family directed to the composition of matter of our subcutaneous formulation of furosemide and methods of treating edema, hypertension or heart failure using the formulation of furosemide. This patent family includes U.S. Patent No. 9,884,039, directed to methods of treatment, U.S. Patent No. 10,272,064, directed to liquid pharmaceutical formulations, one pending U.S. patent application directed to methods of treatment, one granted patent in each of Canada, China and Europe, two granted patents in Japan, one pending patent application in Europe, and seven granted patents and five pending patent applications in other countries outside of the United States. Patents that issue from this patent family are generally expected to expire in 2034, excluding any additional term in the United States for patent term adjustment. U.S. Patent Nos. 9,884,039 and 10,272,064 are scheduled to expire in April 2034.
 
Other furosemide formulations
As of February 7, 2022, we also own a patent family directed to compositions of matter of liquid pharmaceutical formulations containing an increased concentration of furosemide and methods of treating congestion, edema, fluid overload, or hypertension using these formulations of furosemide. This patent family includes one pending U.S. patent application, one pending patent application in each of Canada, China, Europe and Japan, and 11 pending patent applications in other countries outside of the United States. Patents that issue from this patent family are generally expected to expire in 2040, excluding any additional term in the United States for patent term adjustment.
 Trade secret and other protection
In addition to patented intellectual property, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our technology and maintain our competitive position, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality and inventions assignment agreement before beginning their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. The agreements generally provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements generally also provide that we shall own all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us.

Other intellectual property rights
 We file trademark applications and pursue registrations in the United States and abroad when appropriate. We own trademark registrations in the U.S. and E.U. for the marks SCPHARMACEUTICALS and FUROSCIX.
From time to time, we may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses from third-party intellectual property holders.
COMPETITION
Our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face competition and potential competition from a number of sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, generic drug companies, drug delivery companies and academic and research institutions. Some of these companies are developing therapies that are directly competitive to our approach, and others are more generally developing therapies to treat heart failure. These companies include but are not limited to: Abbott Laboratories, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Bioheart, Boston Scientific, Boehringer Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly and Company, Merck & Co., Medtronic, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, Sanofi, Sarfez Pharmaceuticals, Servier Pharmaceuticals, SQ Innovation and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates include ease of administration and convenience of dosing, therapeutic efficacy, safety and tolerability profiles and cost. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, as well as more experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products, and the commercialization of those products. Consequently, our competitors may develop similar products for the treatment of heart failure or for other indications we may pursue in the future, and such competitors’ products may be more effective, better tolerated and less costly than our product candidates. Our competitors may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products than we are. We will also face competition in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment in clinical trials.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 United States Drug Development
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs, medical devices and combinations of drugs and devices, or combination products, under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, requests for voluntary product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.

Our product candidates are subject to regulation as combination products, which means that they are composed of both a drug product and device product. If marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different Centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a Center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of our product candidates, the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product, which means that the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval of our product candidates. Accordingly, we plan to investigate our products through the IND framework and seek approval through the NDA pathway. Based on our discussions with the FDA to date, we do not anticipate that the FDA will require a separate medical device authorization for the on-body infusor component of FUROSCIX, but this could change during the course of its review of any marketing application that we may submit. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 •completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with an applicable IND and other clinical study related regulations, sometimes referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication; 
 •submission to the FDA of an NDA which, for a combination product like FUROSCIX, is expected to include information and data regarding the drug delivery device technology; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice requirements, or cGMP; 
 •potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and 
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale. 
 Once a pharmaceutical product candidate is identified for development, it enters the pre-clinical testing stage. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance, and may be imposed on all drug products within a certain class of drugs. The FDA also can impose partial clinical holds, for example, prohibiting the initiation of clinical trials of a certain duration or for a certain dose.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trial are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.

Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients. 
 •Phase 2. Involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule. 
 •Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials. Companies that conduct certain clinical trials also are required to register them and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, such as ClinicalTrials.gov in the United States, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, findings from other studies that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the product, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk to human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. The clinical trial sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
NDA and FDA Review Process
The results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug, requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program user fee; although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. For example, the agency will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits for review.

The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA typically makes a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. The decision to accept the NDA for filing means that the FDA has made a threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA’s goal to complete its substantive review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant is ten months from the receipt of the NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMPs to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. During its review, the FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL usually describes all the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The CRL may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
505(b)(2) Approval Process
Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA provides an alternate regulatory pathway for the FDA to approve a new product and permits reliance for such approval on published literature or an FDA finding of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product. Specifically, section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Typically, 505(b)(2) applicants must perform additional trials to support the change from the previously approved drug and to further demonstrate the new product’s safety and effectiveness. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Our subcutaneous formulation of furosemide is based upon an already approved version of furosemide in oral and IV formulations, rather than a new chemical entity product candidate. Accordingly, we submitted a 505(b)(2) application that relied on FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for previously-approved oral and/or IV furosemide in our clinical development plans and our NDA submission. We plan to use the 505(b)(2) pathway as well for other product candidates that we may develop.
 Regulation of Combination Products in the United States
Certain products may be comprised of components, such as drug components and device components that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities, and frequently by different centers at the

FDA. These products are known as combination products. Specifically, under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be:
•a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity; 
 •two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products; 
 •a drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, or device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or 
 •any investigational drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect. 
 Under the FDCA and its implementing regulations, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. The designation of a lead center generally eliminates the need to receive approvals from more than one FDA component for combination products, although it does not preclude consultations by the lead center with other components of the FDA. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a drug-device combination product is attributable to the drug product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the drug product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.
A combination product with a drug primary mode of action generally would be reviewed and approved pursuant to the drug approval processes under the FDCA. In reviewing the NDA or 505(b)(2) application for such a product, however, FDA reviewers in the drug center could consult with their counterparts in the device center to ensure that the device component of the combination product met applicable requirements regarding safety, effectiveness, durability and performance. In addition, under FDA regulations, combination products are subject to cGMP requirements applicable to both drugs and devices, including the Quality System Regulations, or QSRs, applicable to medical devices.
Drug-device combination products present unique challenges for competitors seeking approval of Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDA, for generic versions of combination products. Generally, the FDA reviews both the drug and device constituents of a proposed generic product to determine whether it is the same as the innovator product, including whether the basic design and operating principles of the device component are the same and whether minor differences require significant differences in labeling for safe and effective use. If the FDA determines that the device component of the proposed generic product is not the same in terms of performance and critical design, or that the labeling is not the same, it generally will not approve the ANDA. Likewise, if the FDA determines that certain clinical studies, such as clinical usability or human factors studies, are necessary to demonstrate the safety and/or effectiveness of the device component, the FDA generally will not accept or approve an ANDA for a combination product and will instead require the submission of a full NDA or 505(b)(2) application.
Post-Marketing Requirements
Any products for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse events with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, and product sampling and distribution requirements in accordance with the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, a part of the FDCA. Moreover, each component of a combination product retains its regulatory status (as a drug or device, for example) and is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market.

Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion and advertising, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. In addition, a pharmaceutical company must comply with restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers and their agents may not market or promote such off-label uses or provide off-label information in the promotion of drug products that is not consistent with the approved labeling for those products. The FDA and other regulatory and enforcement authorities actively enforce laws and regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label uses and the promotion of products for which marketing approval has not been obtained. A company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to corrective advertising in addition to significant liability, which may include civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions.
In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that combination products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs applicable to drugs and devices, including certain QSR requirements. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. Additionally, manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States.
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development and impact approved products already on the market.
Other Regulatory Matters
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, voluntary recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and

other requirements, new information regarding the safety or effectiveness of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the voluntary recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Alternatively, orphan drug designation may be available if the disease or the condition affects 200,000 or more individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States.
Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product is the first to receive FDA approval of the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same orphan indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity, which may permit off-label use for the orphan indication. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA for the same orphan indication or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
 U.S. Marketing Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications, including 505(b)(2) applications. The FDA provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA (including a 505(b)(2) application), or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. Three-year exclusivity is typically awarded to innovative changes to a previously-approved drug product, such as new indications, dosage forms or strengths. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving applications for drugs that do not have the innovative change, such as generic copies of the original, unmodified drug product. Three-year exclusivity blocks approval of 505(b)(2) applications and ANDAs but will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods, including exclusivity attaching to certain patent certifications. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection and patent terms, may be granted based on the voluntary completion within certain timeframes of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
European Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
In the European Union, the European Medicines Agency’s, or EMA’s, Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, grants orphan designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union, or products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic conditions when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of such products would generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify the necessary investment in developing the products. In each case, orphan designation is only available where no satisfactory method of

diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition has been authorized for marketing in the EU (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected by the condition).
 
In the European Union, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Market exclusivity may also be revoked in very select cases, such as if (i) it is established that a similar medicinal product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the authorized product; (ii) the marketing authorization holder of the authorized orphan product consents to such revocation; or (iii) the marketing authorization holder of the authorized orphan product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, our clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act, or FCA, or federal civil money penalties statute. On December 2, 2020, the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, published further modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Under the final rules, OIG added safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback Statute for certain coordinated care and value-based arrangements among clinicians, providers, and others. This rule (with exceptions) became effective January 19, 2021. Implementation of this change is currently under review by the Biden administration and may be amended or repealed. Additionally, on November 30, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. We continue to evaluate what effect, if any, these developments will have on our business; 
•the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to, or approval by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payers if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery; 


•the anti-inducement law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program; 
 •HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
 •the federal transparency requirements under the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors, and effective January 1, 2022, physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members; 
 •federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs; and 
 •federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers. 
 Additionally, we are subject to state and non-U.S. equivalents of each of the healthcare laws described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payer. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not just governmental payers, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement we could be subject to penalties. Finally, there are state and non-U.S. laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.
We may develop products that, if approved, may be administered by a physician. Under currently applicable U.S. law, certain products not usually self-administered (including injectable drugs) may be eligible for coverage under Medicare through Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B is part of original Medicare, the federal health care program that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, and covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain pharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary’s health condition. As a condition of receiving Medicare Part B reimbursement for a manufacturer’s eligible drugs, the manufacturer is required to participate in other government healthcare programs, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of HHS as a condition for states to

receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities that participate in the program.
In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price, or ASP, and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payers.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
Law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing fraud and abuse laws, and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws. Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties, and our business generally, will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices, including our arrangements with physicians and other healthcare providers, some of whom received stock options as compensation for services provided, may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including, without limitation, the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. In addition, the approval and commercialization of any of our drug candidates outside the United States will also likely subject us to non-U.S. equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other non-U.S. laws.
If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs, which may also adversely affect our business.
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payers have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; imposed a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;

and established the Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.
Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. On January 22, 2018, former President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. In December 2018, the CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of the federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. Since then, the ACA risk adjustment program payment parameters have been updated annually.
Further, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional, and remanded the case to the lower court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the full ACA. On March 2, 2020, the United States Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case, and held oral arguments on November 10, 2020. Pending a decision, the ACA remains in effect, but it is unclear at this time what effect these developments will have on the status of the ACA.
    Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and, due to amendments to the statute, including Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, will stay in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Pursuant to the CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020 to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and subsequent legislation, these reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Then, a 1% payment reduction will occur beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and the 2% payment reduction will resume on July 1, 2022. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the

Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates would have been be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. However, on August 6, 2021 CMS announced a proposed rule to rescind the MFN rule. Additionally, on November 30, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
 In addition, there have been several changes to the 340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities. On December 27, 2018, the District Court for the District of Columbia invalidated a reimbursement formula change under the 340B drug pricing program, and CMS subsequently altered the fiscal years 2019 and 2018 reimbursement formula on specified covered outpatient drugs. The court ruled this change was not an “adjustment” which was within the Secretary’s discretion to make but was instead a fundamental change in the reimbursement calculation. However, most recently, on July 31, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned the district court’s decision and found that the changes were within the Secretary’s authority. On September 14, 2020, the plaintiffs-appellees filed a Petition for Rehearing En Banc (i.e., before the full court), but was denied on October 16, 2020. Plaintiffs-appellees filed a petition for a writ of certiorari at the Supreme Court on February 10, 2021. On Friday July 2, 2021, the Supreme Court granted the petition. It is unclear how these developments could affect covered hospitals who might purchase our future products and affect the rates we may charge such facilities for our approved products in the future, if any.
 Additionally, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to an order entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the portion of the rule eliminating safe harbor protection for certain rebates related to the sale or purchase of a pharmaceutical product from a manufacturer to a plan sponsor under Medicare Part D has been delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. Further, implementation of this change and new safe harbors for point-of-sale reductions in price for prescription pharmaceutical products and pharmacy benefit manager service fees are currently under review by the Biden administration and may be amended or repealed. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
 Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payers. Third-party payers decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payer may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payer’s determination that use of a therapeutic is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan; 
 •safe, effective and medically necessary; 
 •appropriate for the specific patient; 
 •cost-effective; and 
 •neither experimental nor investigational.
 The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payer not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products if approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
In addition, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payer to payer. One third-party payer’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payers will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately and will be a time-consuming process.
Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payer is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payer supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our product on a payer-by-payer basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A third-party payer’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payers. Private third-party payers tend to follow Medicare coverage and reimbursement limitations to a substantial degree, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Therefore, one payer’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop.
Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a

reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures.
The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if third-party payers fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 
Human Capital Management
 As of March 22, 2022, we had 26 full-time employees, including five in research and development, 12 in clinical and medical affairs, regulatory affairs, and quality assurance, two in commercial and seven in finance, general administrative and executive administration. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our employee relations are good.

Our future success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel, maintain our culture, and ensure diversity and inclusion in our board, management and broader workforce. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees as we expand the workforce. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards. A testament to our strong culture is our second year in a row earning a spot on Boston Business Journal’s Best Places to Work list for companies of our size.
 Facilities
Our principal executive offices are located in a 13,066 square foot facility in Burlington, Massachusetts. The term of the lease for our Burlington, Massachusetts facility extends through November 2022. We lease 2,037 square feet in Salem, New Hampshire. The term of the lease for our Salem, New Hampshire facility extends through August 2022. Our facilities house our research and development, sales, marketing, finance and administrative activities. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future and that suitable additional space will be available as and when needed.
