Our Business
 
The Company’s main focus is to develop and commercialize cannabinoid based alternative therapies for indications such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and pain.  Its lead product is Hyalolex, an alternative oral therapy for the treatment of symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The Company has filed several patents for its pipeline of products including ones for the treatment of Parkinson’s Central Nervous System related disorders, eating disorders, and seizures in cats and dogs. The commercialization of Hyalolex through medical dispensaries is expected to commence in the second half of calendar 2018.  Since its inception, the Company operates a legacy business that involves trading commodities and heavy equipment rental.
 
In addition, the Company plans to leverage its technology and cannabis expertise to build meaningful solutions to address issues facing the cannabis industry using distributed ledgers inherent in blockchain technology.  These would include addressing issues such as product identification assurance (PIA) and product origin assurance, transactional difficulties, and inadequate product labeling.  Please see Note 1 in the Financial statements for further information.
 
Business Segments and Revenue Contribution
 
The Company has two business segments: legacy infrastructure, and medical cannabis based alternative therapies. The legacy business has two drivers a) trading of infrastructure commodities like steel, and iron ore, among others and b) rental of heavy equipment.  The legacy infrastructure business contributed 100% of the revenue in fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018.  In fiscal year 2017, our lead product Hyalolex was in its research and development phase and in fiscal 2018 we began production in anticipation of commercialization in the second half of 2018.

Segments | Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2018 |

Legacy infrastructure | $ | 2,192,590
Alternative therapies | | - 
Total IGC | $ | 2,192,590

Segment 1: Legacy Infrastructure
 Since our inception, we have participated in various aspects of the infrastructure industry.  During the fiscal year 2018, we streamlined our legacy infrastructure business to infrastructure commodity trading, and heavy equipment rental.  We trade infrastructure commodities like steel and iron ore, among others, and we rent heavy equipment. Our subsidiary, Techni Bharathi Private Ltd (“TBL”) in India is responsible for heavy equipment rental, and its subsidiary IGC Enterprises Ltd. in Hong Kong is responsible for infrastructure trading.

For the rental business, we supply equipment and operators to construction companies. This business is very small and limited to the city of Kochi in Kerala, India.  In fiscal year 2018 we have three customers all of which are construction companies.  For the trading business we have four customers and no principal supplier.  We are opportunistic and will buy from any of the South Asian countries.  In fiscal 2018 our suppliers are companies based in India and Hong Kong.  For the level of business and the value of each trade, the number of customers we have is adequate and does not constitute inordinate customer risk.  Revenue from our legacy infrastructure business including heavy equipment rental and commodity trading is less than 1% based on revenue of both the rental and trading markets.  This business is highly competitive, and our differentiation is based primarily on price and industry knowledge of commodity requirements for infrastructure projects.  Our strategy in fiscal 2019 for the legacy business is to maintain annual revenue of $3-$5 million and focus on growing margin by reducing the cost of money and by modest investments in heavy equipment.
 
The pricing for steel and iron ore are heavily influenced by tariffs and demand for infrastructure development.  In fiscal year 2018, steel prices although down from fiscal 2017, fluctuated in a relatively narrow band as did iron ore prices.  We do not hedge or take long term positions on commodities. We limit our exposure by contractually ensuring that every purchase has a vetted legitimate buyer and ensuring rapid closing of transactions.  On a transaction basis, this business does not require special government approvals.  We have the requisite business licenses that allow us to operate in this segment.
 
In the fiscal years ending March 31, 2018 and 2017, we funded our subsidiary TBL $75,000 and $43,000 for working capital, respectively.  For the trading business our sales team is in Hong Kong and the sales cycle lasts between two and three months.  For our equipment leasing business our sales team is in Kochi, India, where the sales cycle lasts around two months.  In Malaysia, through our subsidiary Cabaran Ultima, we operated a real estate management business.  During the fiscal year 2018, we decided to exit this business and as of March 31, 2018, we have accounted for our investment in Cabaran Ultima as “Investment Held for Sale” at a fair value of $147,500.  We hope to sell Cabaran Ultima during fiscal year 2019.  Please see Note-22, “Investment Held for Sale” for more information.
 
Segment 2: Alternative therapies (Complementary and Alternative Medicine, “CAM”)
 
We focus on the development and commercialization of cannabinoid-based combination therapies.  Cannabinoids are chemical compounds that exert a range of effects on the body, including impacting the immune response, gastrointestinal maintenance and motility, muscle functioning, and nervous system response and functioning. Phytocannabinoids are cannabinoids that occur naturally in the cannabis plant. Phytocannabinoids are abundant in the viscous resin produced by glandular structures called trichomes. There are over 480 different compounds in the cannabis plant.  Many of them have been identified as cannabinoids. Of these, THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) is the main psychoactive component in the plant with many therapeutic uses.  The other broadly pursued non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid, CBD (Cannabidiol), is pleiotropic influencing many pathways in humans, dogs, and cats, and may be used to provide relief to a variety of symptoms including pain, seizures, and eating disorders.  In medical applications, cannabinoids are extracted from the cannabis plant using a variety of well-established technologies, including using CO2, butane, alcohol, among others, as solvents. The refined extracted material is isolated for specific active ingredients like THC and CBD, among others, and used in formulations as the primary or secondary active ingredient.
 
 Our work and strategy are to use cannabinoids synergistically with other active ingredients that in many cases have been established to treat specific conditions. We seek, through the synergies for our combination therapies, to decrease side effects, increase bio-availability, and enhanced efficacy.  This strategy in some cases leads to “new and improved” products, and in others it results in totally novel products with surprising results, as in the case of Hyalolextm.
 
We have filed eight provisional patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), in the phytocannabinoid-based combination therapy space, for the indications of pain, medical refractory epilepsy, and cachexia. In addition, in May 2017, we acquired an exclusive license to a patent filed by the University of South Florida Research Foundation entitled “Cannabidiol and Synthetic Dronabinol for treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease.”
 
Hyalolextm
 
Hyalolextm is not approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), and therefore is not considered an approved pharmaceutical drug.  It is a Complimentary Alternative Medicine (“CAM”).
 
The name of IGC’s lead product Hyalolextm, is based on the Greek roots hyalo and lex that broadly mean clear, clarity, glass-like, and words, reading, respectively.  In Alzheimer’s cell lines, Alzheimer’s animal models, and in some human studies the active ingredients in Hyalolextm have been shown to alleviate many of the symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s.  Patients with Alzheimer’s suffer from a variety of symptoms including dementia, anxiety, agitation, and sleep disorder, among others. These symptoms often result in hard-to-manage patients and caregiver distress.  As set out below, about 30% of the overall cost of managing Alzheimer’s patients is attributed to caregiver cost. We believe that our product can reduce caregiver distress by helping to better manage patients.

Market Overview of Alzheimer’s Disease
 
Alzheimer’s is known as America’s most expensive disease.  The estimated cost in 2017 to Medicare and Medicaid was about $175 billion. There are currently over 5.3 million Americans with Alzheimer’s disease (“AD”) and around 35 million worldwide. The cost of Alzheimer’s is skyrocketing as the baby-boomers age: the number of AD patients is expected to double over the next 20 years and the direct costs are expected to exceed $450 billion in the next 12 years.  Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is believed to be between three and nine years.  It is the most common cause of dementia among older adults. Currently, no treatment can stop or reverse the progression of the disease and there is still no accepted cure for AD. 
Data for Hyalolextm
 
Our research into cannabinoid-based combination therapies led us to work done at the University of South Florida using cannabinoids on Alzheimer’s disease. The professor working on this unique approach was featured on CNN on Dr. Sanjay Gupta’s show Weed 2.  The work, specifically, reported several novel findings that were subsequently filed as a patent.  In the fiscal year 2018, IGC acquired exclusive rights to the data and the patent filing.  The research reported that micro-dosing of the cannabinoid THC, in combination with another naturally occurring compound, works synergistically to reduce the buildup of plaques and tangles, through allegedly new pathways. These results were shown using Alzheimer’s cell lines.  Plaques and tangles are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.  It is known that patients get plaques and tangles between 15 to 20 years before any Alzheimer’s related symptoms manifest.  The work further showed, on Alzheimer’s cell lines, that micro dosing of THC can increase the functioning of mitochondria.  The findings are unique as all previous research showed the opposite effect at higher doses, for example, loss of mitochondrial functioning.
 
We claim that the novelty is two-fold: one, that micro dosing of THC affects the brain radically differently from normal dosing that is prescribed (FDA approved Dronabinol) or consumed by individuals; the second is that micro doses of THC can synergistically work with other naturally occurring compounds to increase efficacy and reduce side effects.  For example, the research showed that at these therapeutic micro-doses, THC is non-toxic to neurons, a finding that is contrary to massive amounts of research and data showing that THC is neuro-toxic at normally ingested levels.  The research was extended to include a Morris Water Maze test for measuring spatial memory impairment on Alzheimer’s mice.  It was found that Alzheimer’s mice treated with THC were significantly better at negotiating the water maze than untreated mice. Of course, as expected, neither group were anywhere close to the performance of healthy mice.  Preliminary findings have also reported that THC can play a role in triggering neurogenesis, the growth and development of nervous tissue.
 
After a great deal of in-depth research and experiments, our team created an oral formulation, a medicinal syrup, by adding excipients and synergistic ingredients. The formulation has evolved into market-ready Hyalolextm to help patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease.
 
Marketing plan for Hyalolextm
 
Hyalolextm is formulated for a dose of 1 ml either two or three times a day.  It is currently available in 30 ml bottles. We plan to derive revenue by licensing the technology, data, research, brand, and selling the excipients and non-cannabinoid compounds to resellers in various states.  As the final product contains a controlled substance, although in micro-doses, it can only be manufactured by a state licensed entity that conforms to all relevant state regulations.  The reseller will have the product manufactured and delivered to state licensed dispensaries where they can be sold consistent with state laws governing the sale of products containing cannabinoids. The product will only be available to patients in medical states that are registered through specific state sanctioned programs.
 To ensure compliance and product assurance we are developing a QR code (Quick Response code) supported system that will track the product and allow patients to access information about the product and also provide feedback.  To this, we plan to add a backend based on blockchain technology that will go much further in ensuring compliance, product authenticity and product origin.
 
Growth and Expansion Strategy
 
Our growth and expansion strategies are to commercialize and license Hyalolextm in states and countries where we can legally enter the market. Our immediate plans are to commercialize Hyalolextm in 10 states starting with Puerto Rico, Maryland, District of Columbia, and California.
 
Sales, Distribution and Marketing
 
We plan to license Hyalolextm to resellers in medical states and other countries.  Under the licensing agreement, the U.S. based reseller will market and manufacture Hyalolextm and, either directly or indirectly, distribute the product to medical dispensaries where it can be sold. Individuals with medical cards approved by the state will have access to the product.

Manufacturing and Supply
 
Hyalolextm is manufactured in each medical state separately, by a licensed processor (manufacturer).  The manufacturer then sells the products to dispensaries that in turn sell the product to the end user.  The active ingredients are manufactured (grown and extracted) within the state, procured within the state, processed within the state, distributed within the state, and sold to individuals with medical cards within the state.  The state programs are strictly controlled and licensed.  For example, in each state entities must undergo background checks and obtain a license to grow, process, and/or operate a medical dispensary. Individuals that desire to purchase products from dispensaries must obtain a medical card and, in most states, register with the state as a patient.  Further, medical states use software platforms to track plants, extracts, and products very closely to ensure compliance.  In addition, all products are tested by an independent state licensed lab, on a batch basis, for cannabinoid profiles and a host of other measurements that are specific to individual states.
Other products: IGC-501, Serosapse, Caesafin, and Natrinol
 
Other products that we have in the pipeline are IGC-501 for indications of neuropathic pain; Serosapse for indications of Parkinson’s and other Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders; Caesafin for seizures in cats and dogs; and Natrinol for indications of cancer and AIDS induced nausea and vomiting.  None of these are FDA approved and they are not considered to be pharmaceutical drugs. They fall in the category of complimentary alternative medicines or CAMS.
Overview and Target Market for Other Products
 
The pain management market represents a significant component of the healthcare system. In September 2012, The Journal of Pain reported that the annual estimated national cost of pain ranges from $560 billion to $635 billion.  This figure exceeds the entire cost of the nation’s priority health conditions.  Additionally, The American Pain Society recommends that pain be made more visible and be categorized as the fifth vital sign, recognizing that terminal illnesses are often accompanied by unbearable levels that are so severe and difficult to treat that death seems preferable. According to the Arthritis Foundation, arthritis has been particularly problematic for women; since 1999 there has been a 22% increase in the number of women who attribute their disability to arthritis.  Current treatment protocols such as the utilization of opioid-based drug therapies present several challenges and may result in debilitating consequences that affect patients’ day-to-day functioning and patients’ productivity. Commonly reported side effects include hallucinations, constipation, sedation, nausea, respiratory depression, and dysphoria. Our patent filing is based on a novel therapy that uses extracts from the cannabis plant for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and scleroderma pain. The therapy uses a cream that is applied to the joints using a variety of delivery mechanisms including a bio-adhesive patch.
 
There are over one million adults suffering from Parkinson’s disease (PD) in the U.S. PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide with an estimated 1% of adults over 60 suffering from the disease.  The market for curing the disease is very large. We are testing products for end points associated with Parkinson’s disease like REM sleep disorder, anxiety, and dyskinesia. The PD treatment market is expected to reach $5.69 billion by 2022 from $4.24 billion in 2017, at a CAGR of 6.1%. The market is being driven by the growth in aging population and the associated increase in the prevalence of Parkinson’s disease and government funding for research. (Ref: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/parkinson-disease-treatment.asp).
 
Approximately 50 million people worldwide are affected by epilepsy (Sanders, 2003).  Epilepsy is thought to be due to multiple factors that include the alteration of many ion channels like sodium, potassium, and NMDA (N-Methyl-d-aspartate) and neurotransmitters like GABA (gamma amino butyric acid).  It is believed, for example, that to maximally control epilepsy, modulation of one or more of these channels and receptors is required and that monotherapy is adequate in up to 25% of patients.  The onset of epileptic seizures can be life threatening, including long-term implications (Lutz, 2004) such as mental health problems, cognitive deficits and morphological changes (Swann, 2004, Avoli et. al., 2005). The onset of epilepsy also greatly affects lifestyle as sufferers live in fear of consequential injury or the inability to perform daily tasks (Fisher et. al., 2000). The scientific community (1980 Cunha et. al., 1986 Ames, 1990 Trembly et. al. recent testing by GW Pharmaceuticals, among others) have shown that Cannabidiol (CBD) has anti-convulsive properties in humans.  Other studies (Davis and Ramsey) have shown that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) can also help reduce seizures.  Three of our patent filings involving novel therapies use phytocannabinoid extracts from cannabis, in combination with other generic drugs, to treat medical refractory epilepsy in humans and seizures in dogs and cats.
 
Cachexia is a condition that accompanies severe illness such as cancer and results in the weakness and wasting away of the body. Cachexia physically weakens patients to the extent that response to standard treatments is poor.  In the U.S., it is estimated that a population of approximately 1.3 million are experiencing cachexia associated with cancer, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, HIV/AIDS, and other progressive illnesses. Cachexia is secondary to an underlying disease such as cancer or AIDS and is a positive risk factor for death.  As an example, cancer induced anorexia cachexia is responsible for about 20% of all cancer deaths.  Our patent filing involves a novel therapy that uses phytocannabinoids to stimulate senses (smell and taste) with a combination of drugs to stimulate appetite.  Our approach addresses the veterinarian market as dogs and cats also suffer from pain, epilepsy, and cachexia and getting a product to market for the veterinarian industry is significantly less time consuming than getting products approved for human healthcare.  There are 160 million domesticated dogs and cats in the U.S. and about 1% suffer from seizures. Our veterinarian product uses combination therapy for the treatment of seizures in dogs and cats.

QR code-based blockchain PIA
 
The Company has developed and deployed a QR code-based system that allows patients to access a website with specific information on our alternative medicine products. Each QR code is specific to a state and displays information specific to that state.  We are in the process of creating a mobile optimized version that will expand the product information available to patients to include location of dispensaries that carry our products, based on zip code, and in turn also allow us to gather information through surveys and obtain feedback from patients.
 
As the number of states in which the product is available increases, we expect to expand the backend to a blockchain that allows for inputs directly from growers, processors, and dispensaries.  This information will collectively display product identification, and product origination, by providing the patient with information regarding the origin, chemicals, and processes used to manufacture the product.  We expect to expand the QR code-based system in several phases over fiscal 2019.
 
Research and Development
 
  In the fiscal years 2017 and 2018, IGC identified combinations of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the non-psychoactive, medically useful compound Cannabidiol (CBD) to address symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and other diseases.  The costs associated with this work is mostly in-house research.  For example, looking for combinations of plant extracts that could work and data to support the claims that certain combinations and formulations can alleviate symptoms associated with diseases. The estimated amount spent for research and development was approximately $114,000 and $137,000 in the fiscal years 2017 and 2018, respectively.  All research and development costs are expensed in the quarter in which they are incurred.
Competition
 
The development of phytocannabinoid-based therapies is currently not very competitive. The largest amount of research in this area is done in Israel. The most significant research and FDA approved trials are done by one large pharmaceutical company, and to a lesser extent, by two other large firms. In the United States, there is very little wide spread research while most of the research is concentrated in Israel. This is mostly because the United States Drug Enforcement Administrating (“DEA”) classifies phytocannabinoid extracts as a Schedule 1 drug. This means that phytocannabinoids are characterized as substances with “high potential for abuse” and with “no currently accepted medical use.” Further, any study conducted in the US must be registered and approved by the DEA and raw materials purchased through the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA).
 
We view competition in two ways. First, we compete with about fifteen publicly listed companies and two private companies that have articulated a business plan to develop phytocannabinoid-based therapies, two large publicly-listed and well-funded pharmaceutical companies, and three small listed companies. There are several microcap companies trading on the OTC market and two private ones that also competing in this space.  We have limited competition in the areas of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and seizures for dogs and cats using phytocannabinoid- based therapies. In the field of epilepsy in humans there is significant competition and so we are focused on seizures in dogs and cats where there is limited competition. Second, we have competition from non-phytocannabinoid-based therapies: there is severe competition in all areas that we are working on including for example Alzheimer’s, with almost all the massive and well- financed pharmaceutical companies and four pure play listed companies working on the disease, albeit all of them without the use of phytocannabinoids.
 
 Competitive Advantage
 
We believe that there are three factors coalescing to create entrepreneurial opportunities in the cannaceutical industry. The first is deregulation of the industry. This is taking place in the U.S., Canada, Germany, and other parts of the world. We believe that during any major deregulation, it takes several years for market equilibrium to be achieved.  Most large companies don’t react quickly and that creates entrepreneurial opportunities, including as a first mover. The second factor is that the plant has cannabinoids that work on several pathways, in humans and animals, and that these cannabinoids can potentially be used to treat many diseases and aliments. The third factor is a rising awareness and demand for natural products including natural complementary and alternative medicines.
 
Our competitive advantage with products such as Hyalolextm emerges from the following: a) first to market, b) proprietary data, c) patent filings, d) deep understanding of synergies, e) several years of research, f) a pipeline of other products, and f) a well differentiated strategy.  Apart from these competitive advantages specific to Hyalolextm, our management has experience and deep knowledge of deregulating industries; access to foreign markets where testing has less regulatory hurdles; access to intellectual property experts; access to a network of doctors and PhDs; knowledge of FDA trials, extraction techniques, and plant strains.

Governmental Regulations and Approvals
 
Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance and possession, manufacturing, and growing are all illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized for medical and or recreational use, it remains a violation of federal law. 
  | 2018 Form 10-K

A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in Colorado with respect to marijuana, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
In the United States, 29 states, Guam, Puerto Rico and District of Columbia have allowed (subject to licensing) the cultivation, processing and sale of cannabis. The state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level.
 
The previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. In this regard, the prior DOJ Deputy Attorney General of the Obama administration issued a memorandum (the “Cole Memo”) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA.
 
The Cole Memo noted that the Department of Justice is committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provided guidance to Department of Justice attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following in preventing:
 
  
· | the distribution of cannabis to minors;
--+----------------------------------------


· | revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some for to other states;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | cannabis possession or use on federal property.
--+------------------------------------------------



On January 4, 2018, the U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued the Sessions Memo stating that the Cole Memo was rescinded effectively immediately. In particular, Mr. Sessions stated that “prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions,” which require “federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.” Mr. Sessions went on to state in the memorandum that “previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately.”
 
It is unclear at this time whether the Sessions Memo indicates that the Trump administration will strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis or what types of activities will be targeted for enforcement.
 
 However, on March 31, 2018 President Trump signed a $1.3 trillion budget bill that includes a provision that prevents the Justice Department, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, from using funds to arrest or prosecute patients, caregivers and businesses that are acting in compliance with state medical marijuana laws. This provision, known as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, prohibits the Justice Department from using federal funds to interfere with state medical marijuana programs.
 
Our business is impacted by state regulators some of whom must approve our products for sale in their dispensaries.  For example, the Washington DC Department of Health must approve Hyalolextm before it can be manufactured and sold in Washington DC.  Some states also require that marketing material be reviewed.  We face scrutiny by the NYSE American regarding our products, including the modes of operation.  FDA has been regulating CBD companies and this could possibly expand to other cannabis derivatives as well.  Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations is expensive requiring attorneys and experts, however such compliance is not expected to have, an adverse effect on our capital expenditures, competitive position, financial condition, or results of operations.

Employees and Consultants
 
As of March 31, 2018, we employed 16 employees and a total work force of approximately 26 including employees, seasonal contract workers, and advisors in the United States, India, and Malaysia.  These numbers include both the legacy and the alternative therapy segments.
Reclassification
 
In fiscal year 2018, land valued at $5.2 million was previously recorded as investment under non-current asserts.  This land has been reclassified as Property, Plant, and Equipment under non-current assets as we are pursuing options to monetize this asset.  In the fiscal year 2018, a Note Payable in the amount of $1.8 Million was reclassified to current liabilities from non-current liabilities.  Please see “Note 7 – Note Payable and Loans – Others” in Part II, Item 8 in our Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein for more information.
