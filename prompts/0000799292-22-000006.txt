Item 1. BUSINESS
General
M/I Homes, Inc. and subsidiaries is one of the nation’s leading builders of single-family homes. The Company commenced homebuilding activities in 1976. Since that time, the Company has sold over 136,700 homes. Unless this Form 10-K otherwise indicates or the context otherwise requires, the terms the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to M/I Homes, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
The Company consists of two distinct operations: homebuilding and financial services. Our homebuilding operations are aggregated for reporting purposes into two reporting segments - the Northern and Southern regions. Our financial services operations support our homebuilding operations by providing mortgage loans and title services to the customers of our homebuilding operations and are reported as an independent segment.
Our homebuilding operations comprise the most significant portion of our business, representing 97% of consolidated revenue in both 2021 and 2020. We design, market, construct and sell single-family homes and attached townhomes to first-time, move-up, empty-nester, and luxury buyers. In addition to home sales, our homebuilding operations generate revenue from the sale of land and lots. We use the term “home” to refer to a single-family residence, whether it is a single-family home or attached home. We use the term “community” to refer to a single development in which we construct homes, or, at times, “multiple communities” can exist in a single development where we offer multiple product types. We primarily construct homes in planned development communities and mixed-use communities. We are currently offering homes for sale in 175 communities within 16 markets located in eleven states. Our average sales price of homes delivered during 2021 was $420,000, and the average sales price of our homes in backlog at December 31, 2021 was $490,000. We offer homes ranging from a base sales price of approximately $210,000 to $788,000 and believe that this range of price points allows us to appeal to and attract a wide range of buyers. We believe that we distinguish ourselves from competitors by offering homes in select areas with a high level of design and construction quality, providing superior customer service and offering mortgage and title services to fully serve our customers. In our experience, our product offerings and customer service make the homebuying process more efficient for our customers.
Our financial services operations generate revenue primarily from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance and closing services. We offer mortgage banking services to our homebuyers through our 100%-owned subsidiary, M/I Financial, LLC (“M/I Financial”). We offer title services through subsidiaries that are 100%-owned by the Company. Our financial services operations accounted for 3% of our consolidated revenues in both 2021 and 2020. See the “Financial Services” section below for additional information regarding our financial services operations.
Our principal executive offices are located at 4131 Worth Avenue, Suite 500, Columbus, Ohio 43219. The telephone number of our corporate headquarters is (614) 418-8000 and our website address is www.mihomes.com. Information on our website is not a part of and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.

We believe we have experienced management teams in each of our divisions with local market expertise. Our business requires in-depth knowledge of local markets to acquire land in desirable locations and on favorable terms, engage subcontractors, plan communities that meet local demand, anticipate consumer tastes in specific markets, and assess local regulatory environments. Although we centralize certain functions (such as accounting, human resources, legal, land purchase approval, and risk management) to benefit from economies of scale, our local management, generally under the direction of an Area President and supervised by a Region President, exercises considerable autonomy in identifying land acquisition opportunities, developing and implementing product and sales strategies, and controlling costs.
Industry Overview and Current Market Conditions
We believe that new home sales will continue to benefit from a continued undersupply of available homes, historically low mortgage rates, improving employment levels and positive consumer demographics, which are leading to a growing number of younger homebuyers moving to single family homes in suburban locations. However, we also expect that overall economic and homebuilding conditions in the United States in 2022 will continue to be negatively impacted by labor and supply shortages, inflation, and increasing costs of materials and labor. We remain sensitive to changes in market conditions, and continue to focus on controlling overhead leverage and carefully managing our investment in land and land development spending. We are also closely monitoring mortgage availability and lending standards. While interest rates remain low by historical standards, mortgage rates are generally expected to increase during 2022, which could negatively impact affordability and mortgage availability.
Business Strategy
We remain focused on increasing our profitability by generating additional revenue, continuing to expand our market share, shifting our product mix to include more affordable designs, and investing in attractive land opportunities to increase our number of active communities. Consistent with our focus on improving long-term financial results, we expect to continue to emphasize the following strategic business objectives in 2022:
•managing our land spend and inventory levels;
•opening new communities on schedule wherever possible;
•maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity levels;
•expanding the availability of our more affordable Smart Series homes; and
•emphasizing customer service, product quality and design, and premier locations.
Future economic and homebuilding industry conditions and the demand for homes are subject to continued uncertainty due to numerous factors, including the impacts of inflation, increasing labor and supply costs, and supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, and the ongoing impact of the pandemic. These factors are highly uncertain and outside our control. As a result, we can provide no assurance that the positive trends reflected in our financial and operating metrics in 2020 and 2021 will continue in 2022.
Sales and Marketing
During 2021, we continued to focus our marketing efforts on first-time and move-up homebuyers, including home designs targeted to first-time, millennial and empty-nester homebuyers. We market and sell our homes primarily under the M/I Homes brand. Our marketing efforts are directed at driving interest in and preference for the M/I Homes brand over other homebuilders or the resale market.
We provide our homebuyers with the following products, programs and services which we believe differentiate our brand: (1) homes with high quality construction located in attractive areas and desirable communities that are supported by our transferable structural warranty, which is a 10-year warranty in all of our markets; (2) our Whole Home Building Standards which are designed to deliver features and benefits that satisfy the buyer’s expectation for a better-built home, including a more eco-friendly and energy efficient home that we believe will generally save our customers up to 30% on their energy costs compared to a home that is built to minimum code requirements; (3) our Design Studios and Design Consultants that assist our homebuyers in selecting product and design options; (4) fully furnished model homes and highly-trained sales consultants to build the buyer’s confidence and enhance the quality of the homebuying experience; (5) our mortgage financing programs that we offer through M/I Financial, including competitive fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans; (6) our Ready Now Homes program which offers homebuyers the opportunity to close on certain new homes in 60 days or less; and (7) our unwavering focus on customer care and customer satisfaction.
By offering Whole Home Energy-Efficient Homes to our customers, we enable our homebuyers to save on their energy costs (the second largest cost of home ownership) compared to a home that is built to minimum code requirements. We use independent RESNET-Certified Raters and the HERS (Home Energy Rating System) Index, the national standard for energy efficiency, to measure the performance of our homes, including insulation, ventilation, air tightness, and the heating and cooling system. Our divisions’ average scores are generally lower (and, therefore, better) than the Environmental Protection Agency’s Energy Star target standard of 72-75 or the average score for a resale home (130 or higher). These lower HERS scores translate to not only reduced heating/cooling costs for our homebuyers, but also a reduction in energy intensity when compared to an average resale home, and therefore a lower environmental impact. 
To further enhance the homebuying process, we operate Design Studios in a majority of our markets. Our Design Studios allow our homebuyers to select from a variety of product and design options that are available for purchase as part of the original construction of their homes. Our centers are staffed with Design Consultants who help our homebuyers select the right combination of options to meet their budget, lifestyle and design sensibilities. In most of our markets, we offer our homebuyers the option to consider and make design planning decisions using our Envision online design tool. We believe this tool is helpful for prospective buyers to use during the planning phase and makes their actual visit to our Design Studios more productive and efficient as our consultants are able to view the buyer’s preliminary design selections and pull samples in advance of the buyer’s visit. 
We also invest in designing and decorating fully-furnished and distinctive model homes intended to create an atmosphere reflecting how people live today and help our customers imagine the possibilities for a “home of their own, just the way they dreamed it.” We carefully select the interior decorating and design of our model homes to reflect the lifestyles of our 
prospective buyers. We believe these models showcase our homes at their maximum livability and potential and provide ideas and inspiration for our customers to incorporate valuable design options into their new home.
Our company-employed sales consultants are trained and prepared to meet the buyer’s expectations and build the buyer’s confidence by fully explaining the features and benefits of our homes, helping each buyer determine which home best suits the buyer’s needs, explaining the construction process, and assisting the buyer in choosing the best financing option. We give significant attention to the ongoing training of all sales personnel to assure a high level of professionalism and product knowledge. As of December 31, 2021, we employed 248 home sales consultants.
We also offer specialized mortgage financing programs through M/I Financial to assist our homebuyers. We offer conventional financing options along with programs offered by the Federal Housing Authority (“FHA”), U.S. Veterans Administration (“VA”), United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and state housing bond agencies. M/I Financial offers our homebuyers “one-stop” shopping by providing mortgage and title services for the purchase of their home, which we believe saves our customers both time and money. By working with many of the major mortgage providers in the country, we seek to offer our homebuyers unique programs with below-market financing options that are more competitive than what homebuyers could obtain on their own. With respect to title services, the Company’s title subsidiaries work closely with our homebuilding divisions so that we are able to provide an organized and efficient home delivery process.
We also build inventory homes in most of our communities to offer homebuyers the opportunity to close on certain new homes in 60 days or less. These homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who require a home delivery within a short time frame and allow us to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market. We determine our inventory homes strategy in each market based on local market factors, such as job growth, the number of job relocations, housing demand and supply, seasonality and our past experience in the market. We maintain a level of inventory homes in each community based on our current and planned sales pace and construction capacity, and we monitor and adjust inventory homes on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant.
We seek to keep our homebuyers actively involved in the construction of their new home, providing them with continued communication throughout the design and construction process. We achieve this with “MyMIHome”, a web and app experience, that delivers notification of key milestones, photos of the construction progress, checklists for customers to complete, easy access to purchase contracts and other related documents, and more. Our goal is to put the buyer first and enhance the total homebuying experience. We believe prompt and courteous responses to homebuyers’ needs throughout the homebuying process reduce post-delivery repair costs, enhance our reputation for quality and service, and encourage repeat and referral business from homebuyers and the real estate community.
Finally, we believe our ultimate differentiator comes from the principles our company was founded upon: integrity and delivering superior customer service and a quality product. Our customer satisfaction scores are measured by an independent third-party company at both 30 days and 6 months after delivery to hold us accountable for building a home of the highest quality. 
We market our homes using digital and traditional media. The particular media used differs from market to market based on area demographics and other competitive factors. We market directly to consumers via newspaper, direct mail, billboards, radio, and television as well as internet marketing using our website, search engine optimization, paid search, and display advertising. We leverage our presence on referral sites, such as Zillow.com and NewHomeSource.com, to drive sales leads to our internet sales associates. We also use email marketing to maintain communication with existing prospects and customers. We use our social media presence to communicate to potential homebuyers the experiences of customers who have purchased our homes and to provide content about our homes and design features.
In response to the changing needs of consumers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made several adjustments to our sales and marketing strategy. First, we encourage consumers to shop for a new home from the comfort of their existing home by mailing a free VR Headset to them upon request. Each of our home plans are professionally scanned in 3D, creating an immersive Virtual Tour experience. Second, we offer Virtual Appointments. This enables our New Home Sales Consultants to provide a live home tour while engaging in personalized selling conversation. Finally, we offered our flexABILITY program across many of our existing home plans which allows our customers to take existing space in the home and create the room they most need: a home office, classroom, multigenerational suite, or home gym.
Product Lines, Design and Construction
Our residential communities are generally located in suburban areas that are easily accessible through public and personal transportation. Our communities are designed as neighborhoods that fit existing land characteristics. We strive to achieve 
diversity among architectural styles within a community by offering a variety of house models and several exterior design options for each model. We also preserve existing trees and foliage whenever practicable. Normally, homes of the same type or color may not be built next to each other. We believe our communities have attractive entrances with distinctive signage and landscaping and that our attention to community detail avoids a “development” appearance and gives each community a diversified neighborhood appearance.
We offer homes ranging from a base sales price of approximately $210,000 to $788,000 and from approximately 1,000 to 5,500 square feet. In addition to single-family detached homes, we also offer attached townhomes in several of our markets. We believe that offering a wide range of homes enables us to attract first-time, millennial, move-up, empty-nester and luxury homebuyers. It is our goal to sell more than one home to our buyers, and we believe we have had success in this strategy.
We devote significant resources to the research, design and development of our homes to meet the demands of our buyers and evolving market requirements. We regularly review our plans offered per division to ensure that these home designs are still relevant and appropriate for that particular market. Across all of our divisions, we currently offer over 450 different floor plans designed to reflect current lifestyles and design trends. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the housing industry. With a growing at-home workforce, we have had to find ways to accommodate new lifestyle needs. In particular, home offices are in high demand with features such as high ceilings, larger floor area and natural light and special attention to their “Zoom” backgrounds. 
We continue to develop new floor plans and communities specifically for the growing empty-nester market. These plans (primarily ranch and main floor master bedroom type plans) focus on move-down buyers, are smaller in size, and feature outdoor living potential, fewer bedrooms, and better community amenities. Our homebuilding divisions often share successful plans with other divisions, when appropriate.
Our “Smart Series” is now offered in all of our divisions, and it represented approximately 39% of our total sales for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our “Smart Series” is market specific and intended to offer buyers excellent value, great locations, and pre-selected packages of upgraded finishes and appliances. The “Smart Series” targets entry-level and move-down buyers and focuses significant attention on affordability, livability and offering some design flexibility to our customers. This series has become an important and successful part of our overall product lineup. We continue to increase our multi-family Smart Series offerings in several of our divisions. These Smart Series townhome programs are thoughtfully designed and are intended to be more affordable and take advantage of higher density opportunities either as stand-alone communities or planned as part of our conventional Smart Series single-family neighborhoods.
Our “City Collection” floor plans offer a unique and upscale urban lifestyle by utilizing narrow lots, detached rear garages and thoughtfully designed interiors. Our City Collection enables us to participate in new infill development opportunities that extend beyond our traditional suburban markets.
We design all of our product lines to reduce production costs and construction cycle times while adhering to our quality standards and using materials and construction techniques that reflect our commitment to more environmentally conscious homebuilding methods. All of our homes are constructed according to proprietary designs that meet the applicable FHA and VA requirements and all local building codes. We attempt to maintain efficient operations by utilizing standardized materials. Our raw materials consist primarily of lumber, concrete and similar construction materials, and while these materials are generally available from a variety of sources, we have reduced construction and administrative costs by executing national purchasing contracts with select vendors. However, during 2021, we experienced labor and supply shortages and price increases. Our homes are constructed according to standardized prototypes which are designed and engineered to provide innovative product design while attempting to minimize costs of construction and control product consistency and availability. We believe our construction process, and the construction cycle times resulting from product line design reference above, generally reduce the time our subcontractors and vendors spend transporting labor, equipment, and materials to and from our communities and thereby also reduce the environmental impact and carbon emissions associated with construction for our homes. We generally employ subcontractors for the installation of site improvements and the construction of homes. The construction of each home is supervised by a Personal Construction Supervisor who reports to a Production Manager, both of whom are employees of the Company. Our Personal Construction Supervisors manage the scheduling and construction process. Subcontractor work is performed pursuant to written agreements that require our subcontractors to comply with all applicable laws and labor practices, follow local building codes and permits, and meet performance, warranty, and insurance requirements. The agreements generally specify a fixed price for labor and materials and are structured to provide price protection for a majority of the higher-cost phases of construction for homes in our backlog. 
We begin construction on a majority of our homes after we have obtained a sales contract and preliminary oral confirmation from the buyer’s lender that financing should be approved. In certain markets, contracts may be accepted contingent upon the sale of an existing home, and construction may be authorized through a certain phase prior to satisfaction of that contingency. The construction of our homes typically takes approximately four to six months from the start of construction to completion of the home, depending on the size and complexity of the particular home being built, weather conditions, and the availability of labor, materials, and supplies. However, due to the strong overall housing demand and the ongoing impact of the pandemic, we experienced disruptions in our supply chain during 2021, including the availability of labor and the timely availability of certain materials, which have lengthened the production cycle times in certain markets. We also construct inventory homes (i.e., homes started in the absence of an executed contract) to facilitate delivery of homes on an immediate-need basis under our Ready Now Homes program and to provide presentation of new products. For some prospective buyers, selling their existing home has become a less predictable process and, as a result, when they sell their home, they often need to find, buy and move into a new home in 60 days or less. Other buyers simply prefer the certainty provided by being able to fully visualize a home before purchasing it. Of the total number of homes closed in 2021 and 2020, 35% and 49%, respectively, were inventory homes which include both homes started as inventory homes and homes that started under a contract that were later cancelled and became inventory homes as a result. The decline in the percentage of inventory homes closed in 2021 was due to our lower cancellation rate in 2021 compared to 2020 as well as selling our available lots reserved for inventory homes prior to beginning construction as a result of the high demand. Additionally, we generally prioritize backlog starts over inventory starts, and we were limited by construction capacity constraints from starting more inventory homes in certain communities in 2021.
Backlog
We sell our homes under standard purchase contracts, which generally require a homebuyer deposit at the time of signing the contract. The amount of the deposit varies among markets and communities. We also generally require homebuyers to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrades for their homes. Most of our home purchase contracts stipulate that if a homebuyer cancels a contract with us, we have the right to retain the homebuyer’s deposits. However, we generally permit our homebuyers to cancel their obligations and obtain refunds of all or a portion of their deposits (unless home construction has started) in the event mortgage financing cannot be obtained within the period specified in their contract to maintain goodwill with the potential buyer.
Backlog consists of homes that are under contract but have not yet been delivered. Ending backlog represents the number of homes in backlog from the previous period plus the number of net new contracts (new contracts for homes less cancellations) generated during the current period minus the number of homes delivered during the current period. The backlog at any given time will be affected by cancellations. Due to the seasonality of the homebuilding industry, the number of homes delivered has historically increased from the first to the fourth quarter in any year.
As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 4,835 homes in backlog with an aggregate sales value of $2.4 billion, in various stages of completion, including homes that are under contract but for which construction had not yet begun. As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 4,389 homes in backlog, with an aggregate sales value of $1.8 billion. Homes included in year-end backlog are typically included in homes delivered in the subsequent year.
Warranty
We provide certain warranties in connection with our homes and also perform inspections with the buyer of each home immediately prior to delivery and as needed after a home is delivered. The Company offers both a transferable limited warranty program (“Home Builder’s Limited Warranty”) and a transferable structural limited warranty. The Home Builder’s Limited Warranty covers construction defects for a statutory period based on geographic market and state law (currently ranging from six to ten years for the states in which the Company operates) and includes a mandatory arbitration clause. The structural warranty is for 10 years for homes sold after December 31, 2021, 10 or 15 years for homes sold after December 1, 2015 and on or before December 31, 2021, and 10 or 30 years for homes sold after April 25, 1998 and on or before December 1, 2015. We also pass along to our homebuyers all warranties provided by the manufacturers or suppliers of components installed in each home. Although our subcontractors are generally required to repair and replace any product or labor defects during their respective warranty periods, we are ultimately responsible to the homeowner for making such repairs during our applicable warranty period. Accordingly, we have estimated and established reserves for both our Home Builder’s Limited Warranty and potential future structural warranty costs based on the number of home deliveries and historical data trends for our communities. In the case of the structural warranty, we also employ an actuary to assist in the determination of our future costs on an annual basis. Our warranty expense (excluding stucco-related repair costs in certain of our Florida communities in 2020, as more fully discussed in Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements) was approximately 0.6% of total housing revenue in 2021, and 0.7% of total housing revenue in both 2020 and 2019.
Land Acquisition and Development
We continuously evaluate land acquisition opportunities in the normal course of our homebuilding business, and we focus on both replenishing our lot positions and adding to our lot positions in key submarkets to expand our market share. Our goal is to maintain an approximate three to five-year supply of lots, including lots controlled under option contracts and purchase agreements, which we believe provides an appropriate horizon for addressing regulatory matters and land development and the subsequent build-out of the homes in each community, and allows us to manage our business plan for future home deliveries. 
We are focused on adding land positions in desirable locations in a cost effective manner that is responsive to changing market conditions and growing our market share and community count in our existing markets. Before acquiring land, we complete extensive comparative studies and analyses, which assist us in evaluating the economic feasibility of each land acquisition. We consider a number of factors, including projected rates of return, estimated gross margins, and projected pace of absorption and sales prices of the homes to be built, all of which are impacted by our evaluation of population and employment growth patterns, demographic trends and competing new home subdivisions and resales in the relevant sub-market.
We attempt to acquire land with a minimum cash investment and negotiate takedown options when available from sellers. We also restrict the use of guarantees or commitments in our land contracts to limit our financial exposure to the amounts invested in the property and development costs during the life of the community we are developing. We believe this approach significantly reduces our risk. In addition, we generally obtain necessary development approvals before we acquire land. We acquire land primarily through contingent purchase agreements, which typically condition our obligation to purchase land upon approval of zoning and utilities, as well as our evaluation of soil and subsurface conditions, environmental and wetland conditions, market analysis, development costs, title matters and other property-related criteria. All land and lot purchase agreements and the funding of land purchases require the approval of our corporate land acquisition committee, which is comprised of our senior management team and key operating and financial officers. Further details relating to our land option agreements are included in Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In 2021, we continued to increase our investments in land acquisition, land development and housing inventory to meet demand and expand our operations in certain markets. In 2021, we developed over 83% of our lots internally, primarily due to a lack of availability of developed lots in desirable locations in our markets. Raw land that requires development generally remains more available. In order to minimize our investment and risk of large exposure in a single location, we have periodically partnered with other land developers or homebuilders to share in the cost of land investment and development through joint ownership and development agreements, joint ventures, and other similar arrangements. For joint venture arrangements where a special purpose entity is established to own the property, we enter into limited liability company or similar arrangements (“LLCs”) with the other partners. Further details relating to our joint venture arrangements are included in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
During the development of lots, we are required by some municipalities and other governmental authorities to provide completion bonds or letters of credit for utilities, streets and other improvements. The development agreements under which we are required to provide completion bonds or letters of credit are generally not subject to a required completion date and only require that the improvements are in place in phases as homes are built and sold. In locations where development has progressed, the amount of development work remaining to be completed is typically less than the remaining amount of bonds or letters of credit due to timing delays in obtaining release of the bonds or letters of credit. 
Our ability to continue development activities over the long-term will depend upon, among other things, a suitable economic environment and our continued ability to locate suitable parcels of land, enter into options or agreements to purchase such land, obtain governmental approvals for such land, and consummate the acquisition and development of such land.
In the normal course of our homebuilding business, we balance the economic risk of owning lots and land with the necessity of having lots available for construction of our homes. The following table sets forth our land position in lots (including lots held in joint venture arrangements) at December 31, 2021:

 | Lots Owned | | 
Region | Developed Lots | Lots Under Development | Undeveloped Lots (a) | Total Lots Owned | Lots Under Contract | Total
Northern | 3,218 | | 1,236 | | 3,275 | | 7,729 | 7,160 | 14,889
Southern | 2,482 | | 4,639 | | 9,743 | | 16,864 | 12,204 | 29,068
Total | 5,700 | | 5,875 | | 13,018 | | 24,593 | 19,364 | 43,957

(a)Includes our interest in raw land held by joint venture arrangements expected to be developed into 3,099 lots.
Financial Services
We sell our homes to customers who generally finance their purchases through mortgages. M/I Financial provides our customers with competitive financing and coordinates and expedites the loan origination transaction through the steps of loan application, loan approval, and closing and title services. M/I Financial provides financing services in all of our housing markets. We believe that our ability to offer financing to customers on competitive terms as a part of the sales process is an important factor in completing sales.
M/I Financial has been approved by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, FHA, VA and USDA to originate mortgages that are insured and/or guaranteed by these entities. In addition, M/I Financial has been approved by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) as a seller and servicer of mortgages and as a Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) issuer. Our agency approvals, along with a sub-servicing relationship, allow us to sell loans on either a servicing released or servicing retained basis. This option provides flexibility and additional financing options to our customers.
We also provide title and closing services to purchasers of our homes through our 100%-owned subsidiaries, TransOhio Residential Title Agency Ltd., M/I Title Agency Ltd., and M/I Title LLC. Through these entities, we serve as a title insurance agent by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to purchasers of our homes in the Columbus, Cincinnati, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Detroit, Tampa, Orlando, Sarasota, San Antonio, Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth, Austin and Indianapolis markets.  In addition, TransOhio Residential Title Agency Ltd. provides examination and title insurance services to our housing markets in the Raleigh, Charlotte and Chicago markets. We assume no underwriting risk associated with the title policies.
Corporate Operations
Our corporate operations and home office are located in Columbus, Ohio, where we perform the following functions at a centralized level:
•establish strategy, goals and operating policies;
•ensure brand integrity and consistency across all local and regional communications;
•monitor and manage the performance of our operations;
•allocate capital resources;
•provide financing and perform all cash management functions for the Company, and maintain our relationship with lenders;
•maintain centralized information and communication systems; and
•maintain centralized financial reporting, internal audit functions, and risk management.
Competition
The homebuilding industry is fragmented and highly competitive. We operate as a top ten builder in the majority of our markets. We compete with numerous national, regional, and local homebuilders in each of the geographic areas in which we operate. Our competition ranges from small local builders to larger regional builders to publicly-owned builders and developers, some of which have greater financial, marketing, land acquisition, and sales resources than us. Previously owned homes and the availability of rental housing provide additional competition. We compete primarily on the basis of price, location, design, quality, service, and reputation. 
Our financial services operations compete with other mortgage lenders to arrange financings for homebuyers. Principal competitive factors include pricing, mortgage loan terms, underwriting criteria, interest rates, customer service and other features of mortgage loan products available to the consumer. 
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
Our homebuilding operations are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment, including the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, storm water and surface water management, soil, groundwater and wetlands protection, subsurface conditions and air quality protection and enhancement. Environmental laws and existing conditions may result in delays, cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs and prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive areas.
Our homebuilding operations are also subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning building, zoning, design, construction, sales, consumer protection and similar matters. These regulations increase 
the cost to produce and market our homes, and in some instances, delay our ability to develop and finish lots and can present a similar challenge for the timely delivery of finished lots to us by outside developers. Counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards. In addition, our homebuilding operations are regulated in certain areas by restrictive zoning and density requirements that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. We may also experience extended timelines for receiving required approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that can delay our anticipated development and construction activities in our communities. During 2021, we experienced delays in receiving governmental and municipality approvals in certain of our community locations, and we expect that we may experience a higher level of delays in 2022.
Our mortgage company and title insurance agencies are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations (including requirements for participation in programs offered by FHA, VA, USDA, Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). These regulations restrict certain activities of our financial services operations as further described in our description of “Risk Factors” below in Item 1A. In addition, our financial services operations are subject to regulation at the state and federal level, including regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with respect to specific origination, selling and servicing practices.
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on Government Regulation and Environmental Matters.
Seasonality
Our homebuilding operations have historically experienced significant seasonality and quarter-to-quarter variability in homebuilding activity levels. In general, homes delivered increase substantially in the second half of the year. We believe that this seasonality reflects the tendency of homebuyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter, as well as the scheduling of construction to accommodate seasonal weather conditions. Our financial services operations also experience seasonality because their loan originations correspond with the delivery of homes in our homebuilding operations. Currently, as a result of limiting sales in nearly half of our communities and the supply chain and labor disruptions increasing cycle times, we are experiencing less seasonality than we have historically experienced.
Human Capital
At December 31, 2021, we employed 1,657 people (including part-time employees), including 1,308 in homebuilding operations, 235 in financial services and 114 in management and administrative services. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.
We believe that our employees are our most important resource. Our workforce development strategy is rooted in building a workforce in which individuals from a diverse mix of backgrounds, experiences and talents can thrive, contribute and develop professionally. We recognize the value of creating a collaborative, inclusive workplace, and to help foster such an environment, we promote a culture of mutual understanding and respect among employees, customers and building partners.
We are committed to a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. In 2020, we established a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee (the “DEI Committee”) which is comprised of certain members of our executive team and senior leaders in our human resources department and our mortgage and business operations divisions. The DEI Committee is responsible for developing the guiding principles of our diversity, equity and inclusion program and a strategy to further these principles and achieve our goals. 
We believe in developing each employee’s professional skill set and promoting career development. Our operating divisions assign training to our employees based upon their particular roles and responsibilities. In addition, all of our employees must adhere to our code of conduct and participate in mandatory company-wide training sessions to ensure all employees follow the same set of safety and ethical standards. These training sessions cover topics such as workplace safety, cyber security, risk mitigation, unconscious bias, harassment, and discrimination.
We pay our employees competitively and offer a comprehensive set of benefits to full-time employees, including a 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan to help employees plan for retirement, which we believe are competitive with others in our industry.
