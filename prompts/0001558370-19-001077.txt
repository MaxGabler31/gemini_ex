 Item 1.  Business
 Overview
 VIVUS is a specialty pharmaceutical company with three approved therapies and one product candidate in active clinical development. PANCREAZE® (pancrelipase), which we acquired in June 2018, is indicated for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (“EPI”) due to cystic fibrosis or other conditions. Qsymia® (phentermine and topiramate extended release) is approved by FDA for chronic weight management. STENDRA® (avanafil) is approved by FDA for erectile dysfunction (“ED”) and by the European Commission (“EC”) under the trade name SPEDRA, for the treatment of ED in the EU. VI-0106 (tacrolimus) is in active clinical development and is being studied in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”).
 VIVUS was incorporated in California in 1991 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1996. Our corporate headquarters is located at 900 E. Hamilton Avenue, Suite 550, Campbell, California 95008, and our telephone number is (650) 934‑5200.
 Business Strategy
 Early in 2018, we announced that we would focus our strategy on building a portfolio of cash flow generating assets to leverage our expertise in commercializing specialty pharmaceutical assets. In April 2018, John Amos was named our new Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board of Directors to lead our new strategy. In addition, we added Kenneth Suh and M. Scott Oehrlein as President and Chief Operations Officer, respectively. These three individuals have strong track records of building successful cash flow positive businesses through product acquisition. In combination with the other current members of the senior leadership team, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to successfully execute on our business strategy.
 In June 2018, we completed the first acquisition under this strategy when we acquired all product rights for PANCREAZE® (pancrelipase) in the United States and PANCREASE® MT in Canada for $135.0 million in cash from Janssen Pharmaceuticals (“Janssen”). PANCREAZE is a prescription medicine used to treat people who cannot digest food normally because their pancreas does not make enough enzymes due to cystic fibrosis or other conditions. We believe we can support PANCREAZE by leveraging our existing commercial infrastructure and expanding it to include up to 10 additional sales representatives in the U.S. and possibly two sales representatives in Canada focused on gastrointestinal and cystic fibrosis physicians.
 In April 2018, we entered into a note purchase agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with affiliates of Athyrium Capital Management (“Athyrium”) for the issuance and sale of up to $110.0 million of 10.375% senior secured notes due 2024 to be issued substantially concurrently with the consummation of the PANCREAZE acquisition. The Note Purchase Agreement also allows up to an additional $10.0 million of 10.375% senior secured notes due 2024 to be issued at our option within 12 months of the initial issue date, subject to certain conditions. Notes in the amount of $110.0 million were issued in June 2018. Concurrent with the issuance of the initial notes, we issued warrants to purchase 0.3 million shares of our common stock to the note holders. Additionally, concurrent with the issuance of the senior secured notes, we repurchased the Convertible Notes held by Athyrium, with a face value of $60.0 million, at a discount to par plus accrued interest. In October 2018, we settled a purchase of approximately $8.6 million outstanding principal amount of our Convertible Notes for approximately $7.1 million plus accrued interest. We continue our evaluation of alternatives for addressing our remaining principal balance of $181.4 million of the Convertible Notes.

 Commercial Products

Qsymia
 FDA approved Qsymia in July 2012 as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adult obese or overweight patients in the presence of at least one weight related comorbidity, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus or high cholesterol, or dyslipidemia. Qsymia incorporates a proprietary formulation combining low doses of the active ingredients from two previously approved drugs, phentermine and topiramate. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, Qsymia is believed to suppress appetite and increase satiety, or the feeling of being full, the two main mechanisms that impact eating behavior.
 We commercialize Qsymia in the U.S. through a specialty sales force with 18 external and three internal sales representatives who promote Qsymia to physicians and focus on high value territories. Our sales efforts are focused on maintaining a commercial presence with high volume prescribers of anti-obesity products. Our marketing efforts have focused on rolling out unique programs to encourage targeted prescribers to gain more experience with Qsymia with their obese or overweight patient population. We continue to invest in digital media in order to amplify our messaging to information-seeking consumers. The digital messaging encourages those consumers most likely to take action to speak with their physicians about obesity treatment options. We believe our enhanced digital strategies deliver clear and compelling communications to potential patients. We have also recently added a direct distribution option for Qsymia patients in addition to the retail pharmacy channel. We utilize a patient savings plan to further drive Qsymia brand preference at the point of prescription and to encourage long-term use of the brand.
 In the first quarter of 2019, we plan to initiate a Phase 4 clinical study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Qsymia capsules in obese adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 years. The Phase 4 post-marketing study, which FDA required as part of the approval of Qsymia in 2012, is expected to enroll 200 patients at approximately 20 clinical sites in the United States.  The primary endpoint of the randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study is the mean percentage change in body-mass index compared with placebo over 56 weeks of treatment.  Participants will also be instructed to follow a reduced-calorie diet and to implement a family-based lifestyle modification program that includes physical activity, behavioral change and family support. Safety and tolerability of Qsymia will also be assessed. We expect to report top-line results from this Phase 4 trial in the second half of 2020.
 In September 2017, we entered into a license and commercialization agreement (the “Alvogen License Agreement”) and a commercial supply agreement (the “Alvogen Supply Agreement”) with Alvogen Malta Operations (ROW) Ltd (“Alvogen”). Under the terms of the Alvogen License Agreement, Alvogen will be solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for all sales and marketing activities for Qsymia in South Korea. We received an upfront payment of $2.5 million in September 2017 and are eligible to receive additional payments upon Alvogen achieving marketing authorization, commercial launch and reaching a sales milestone. Additionally, we will receive a royalty on Alvogen’s Qsymia net sales in South Korea. Under the Alvogen Supply Agreement, we will supply product to Alvogen.

PANCREAZE
 Approved in 2010, PANCREAZE is a pancreatic enzyme preparation consisting of pancrelipase, an extract derived from porcine pancreatic glands, as well as other enzyme classes, including porcine-derived lipases, proteases and amylases. PANCREAZE is specifically indicated for the treatment of EPI.  EPI is a condition that results from a deficiency in the production and/or secretion of pancreatic enzymes. It is associated with cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis, and affects approximately 85 percent of cystic fibrosis patients.  There is no cure for EPI and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is the primary treatment for the condition. We commercialize PANCREAZE in the U.S. and Canada by leveraging our existing commercial infrastructure and expanding it to include 10 additional contract sales representatives in the U.S. and possibly two sales representatives in Canada focused on gastro-intestinal and cystic fibrosis physicians.
 Since its approval, PANCREAZE has been commercialized by Janssen. In June 2018, we acquired the commercial rights to PANCREAZE and PANCREASE MT in the U.S. and Canada.

STENDRA/SPEDRA
 STENDRA is an oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (“PDE5”) inhibitor that we have licensed from Mitsubishi 

 
  6

 
Tanabe Pharma Corporation (“MTPC”). FDA approved STENDRA in April 2012 for the treatment of ED in the United States. In June 2013, the EC adopted a decision granting marketing authorization for SPEDRA, the approved trade name for avanafil in the EU, for the treatment of ED in the EU.
 The Menarini Group, through its subsidiary Berlin Chemie AG (“Menarini”), is our exclusive licensee for the commercialization and promotion of SPEDRA for the treatment of ED in over 40 countries, including the EU Member States, Australia and New Zealand. In addition, Menarini licensed rights directly from MTPC to commercialize avanafil in certain Asian territories. We receive royalties from Menarini based on SPEDRA net sales and are entitled to receive future milestone payments based on certain net sales targets. Menarini will also reimburse us for payments made to cover various obligations to MTPC during the term of the Menarini License Agreement. Menarini obtains SPEDRA exclusively from us.
 Metuchen Pharmaceuticals LLC (“Metuchen”) is our exclusive licensee for the development, commercialization and promotion of STENDRA in the United States, Canada, South America and India. Metuchen reimburses us for payments made to cover royalty and milestone obligations to MTPC, but otherwise owes us no future royalties. Metuchen obtains STENDRA exclusively from us.
 We are currently in discussions with potential collaboration partners to develop, market and sell STENDRA for territories in which we do not currently have a commercial collaboration, including Africa, the Middle East, Turkey, the CIS, including Russia, Mexico and Central America.
 Product Development Pipeline and Life Cycle Management

VI-0106 - Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
 PAH is a chronic, life-threatening disease characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which are the arteries between the heart and lungs, due to pathologic proliferation of epithelial and vascular smooth muscle cells in the lining of these blood vessels and excess vasoconstriction. Pulmonary blood pressure is normally between 8 and 20 mmHg at rest as measured by right heart catheterization. In patients with PAH, the pressure in the pulmonary artery is greater than 25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg during physical activity. These high pressures make it difficult for the heart to pump blood through the lungs to be oxygenated.
 The current medical therapies for PAH involve endothelin receptor antagonists, PDE5 inhibitors, prostacyclin analogues, selective prostaglandin I2 receptor agonists, and soluble guanate cyclase stimulators, which aim to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life. All currently approved products treat the symptoms of PAH, but do not address the underlying disease. We believe that tacrolimus can be used to enhance reduced bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (“BMPR2”) signaling that is prevalent in PAH patients and may therefore address a fundamental cause of PAH.
 The prevalence of PAH varies among specific populations, but it is estimated at between 15 and 50 cases per million adults. PAH usually develops between the ages of 20 and 60 but can occur at any age, with a mean age of diagnosis around 45 years. Idiopathic PAH is the most common type, constituting approximately 40% of the total diagnosed PAH cases, and occurs two to four times more frequently in females.
 On January 6, 2017, we acquired the exclusive, worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of BMPR2 activators for the treatment of PAH and related vascular diseases from Selten Pharma, Inc. (“Selten”). Selten assigned to us its license to a group of patents owned by the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University (“Stanford”) which cover uses of tacrolimus and ascomycin to treat PAH. We paid Selten an upfront payment of $1.0 million, and we will pay additional milestone payments based on global development status and future sales milestones, as well as tiered royalty payments on future sales of these compounds. The total potential milestone payments are $39.0 million to Selten. We have assumed full responsibility for the development and commercialization of the licensed compounds for the treatment of PAH and related vascular diseases.
 In October 2017, we held a pre-IND meeting with FDA for VI-0106, our proprietary formulation of tacrolimus for the treatment of PAH. FDA addressed our questions related to preclinical, nonclinical and clinical data and the planned design of clinical trials of tacrolimus in class III and IV PAH patients, and clarified the requirements needed to file an IND to initiate a clinical trial in this indication. As discussed with FDA, we currently intend to design and conduct clinical trials that could qualify for Fast Track and/or Breakthrough Therapy designation.

 Tacrolimus for the treatment of PAH has received Orphan Drug Designation from FDA in the United States and the European Commission on a basis of a scientific opinion adopted by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency in the EU. We are focusing on the development of a proprietary oral formulation of tacrolimus to be used in a clinical development program and for commercial use. We anticipate filing an IND with FDA and completing the development of our proprietary formulation of tacrolimus in 2019. We are currently seeking alternatives for financing the development of tacrolimus.

Qsymia for Additional Indications
 We are currently considering further development of Qsymia for the treatment of various diseases, including obstructive sleep apnea and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”). We expect no future development until we have concluded our discussions with FDA regarding our CVOT for Qsymia. Products and Development Programs
 Our approved drugs and investigational drug candidates are summarized as follows:

  Qsymia for the Treatment of Obesity
 Many factors contribute to excess weight gain. These include environmental factors, genetics, health conditions, certain medications, emotional factors and other behaviors. All this contributes to more than 110 million Americans being obese or overweight with at least one weight‑related comorbidity. Excess weight increases the risk of cardiometabolic and other conditions including type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart disease, sleep apnea, stroke and osteoarthritis. According to the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) losing just 10% of body

weight may help obese patients reduce the risk of developing other weight‑related medical conditions, while making a meaningful difference in health and well‑being.
 Qsymia for the treatment of obesity was approved as an adjunct to a reduced‑calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adult patients with an initial BMI of 30 or greater (obese patients) or with a BMI of 27 or greater (overweight patients) in the presence of at least one weight‑related comorbidity, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus or high cholesterol, or dyslipidemia. Qsymia incorporates low doses of active ingredients from two previously approved drugs, phentermine and topiramate. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, Qsymia is believed to target appetite and satiety, or the feeling of being full, the two main mechanisms that impact eating behavior.
 Qsymia was approved with a REMS with a goal of informing prescribers and patients of reproductive potential regarding an increased risk of orofacial clefts in infants exposed to Qsymia during the first trimester of pregnancy, the importance of pregnancy prevention for females of reproductive potential receiving Qsymia and the need to discontinue Qsymia immediately if pregnancy occurs. The Qsymia REMS program includes a medication guide, patient brochure, healthcare provider training, distribution through certified home delivery and retail pharmacies, an implementation system and a time‑table for assessments.
 Upon receiving approval to market Qsymia, FDA required that we perform additional studies of Qsymia including a CVOT.  To date, there have been no indications throughout the Qsymia clinical development program nor post-marketing experience of any increase in adverse cardiovascular (“CV”) events.  Given this historical information, along with the established safety profiles of phentermine and topiramate, we continue to believe that Qsymia poses no true cardiovascular safety risk. We have held several meetings with FDA to discuss alternative strategies for obtaining CV outcomes data that would be substantially more feasible and that ensure timely collection of data to better inform on the CV safety of Qsymia.  We worked with cardiovascular and epidemiology experts in exploring alternate solutions to demonstrate the long-term cardiovascular safety of Qsymia. After reviewing a summary of Phase 3 data relevant to CV risk and post-marketing safety data, the cardiology experts noted that they believe there was an absence of an overt CV risk signal and indicated that they did not believe a randomized placebo-controlled CVOT would provide additional information regarding the CV risk of Qsymia. The epidemiology experts maintained that a well-conducted retrospective observational study could provide data to further inform on potential CV risk. We worked with the expert group to develop a protocol and conduct a retrospective observational study. We have submitted information from this study to FDA in support of a currently pending supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) seeking changes to the Qsymia label. Although we and consulted experts believe there is no overt signal for CV risk to justify the CVOT, we are committed to working with FDA to reach a resolution.  There is no assurance, however, that FDA will accept any measures short of those specified in the CVOT to satisfy this requirement.
 In May 2013, the EC issued a decision refusing the grant of marketing authorization in the EU for Qsiva™, the approved trade name for Qsymia in the EU. In September 2013, we submitted a request to the EMA for Scientific Advice, a procedure similar to the U.S. Special Protocol Assessment process, regarding use of a pre-specified interim analysis from the CVOT to assess the long-term treatment effect of Qsymia on the incidence of major adverse CV events in overweight and obese subjects with confirmed CV disease. Our request was to allow this interim analysis to support the resubmission of an application for a marketing authorization for Qsiva for the treatment of obesity in accordance with the EU centralized marketing authorization procedure. We received feedback in 2014 from the EMA and the various competent authorities of the EU Member States associated with review of the CVOT protocol. As for the EU, even if FDA were to accept a retrospective observational study in lieu of a CVOT, there would be no assurance that the EMA would accept the same.
 We have granted an exclusive license to Alvogen to commercialize and promote Qsymia for the treatment of obesity in South Korea.
 Foreign regulatory approvals, including EC marketing authorization to market Qsiva in the EU, may not be obtained on a timely basis, or at all, and the failure to receive regulatory approvals in a foreign country would prevent us from marketing our products that have failed to receive such approval in that market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 In June 2017, we entered into a settlement agreement with Actavis Laboratories FL, Inc., Actavis, Inc., and Actavis PLC, collectively referred to as Actavis, and in August 2017, we entered into a settlement agreement with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, S.A. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc., collectively referred to as DRL.  The settlement

agreement with Actavis will permit Actavis to begin selling a generic version of Qsymia on December 1, 2024, or earlier under certain circumstances. The settlement agreement with DRL will permit DRL to begin selling a generic version of Qsymia on June 1, 2025, or earlier under certain circumstances.
 PANCREAZE for the Treatment of Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency
 The pancreas produces enzymes to help with the digestion of food. EPI is a condition that results from a deficiency in the production and/or secretion of pancreatic enzymes. Due to a lack of these enzymes, people with EPI cannot properly digest the nutrients in food such as fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. EPI is associated with acute or chronic pancreatitis, which constitutes approximately 51% of the EPI market, cystic fibrosis, which constitutes approximately 20% of the EPI market and pancreatic cancer, which constitutes approximately 11% of the EPI market. There is no cure for EPI and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is the primary treatment for the condition.
 Approved in 2010, PANCREAZE is a pancreatic enzyme preparation consisting of pancrelipase, an extract derived from porcine pancreatic glands, as well as other enzyme classes, including porcine-derived lipases, proteases and amylases. PANCREAZE is specifically indicated for the treatment of EPI.
 Since its approval, PANCREAZE has been commercialized by Janssen. In June 2018, we acquired the commercial rights to PANCREAZE and PANCREASE MT in the U.S. and Canada, respectively. In connection with the acquisition of PANCREAZE, we and Janssen also entered into transition services agreements pursuant to which Janssen and a Canadian affiliate of Janssen will provide certain transition services to us in the U.S. and Canada as we transition to full control over the PANCREAZE supply chain. The transition in the U.S. occurred in the first quarter of 2019. We commercialize PANCREAZE in the U.S. and Canada by leveraging our existing commercial infrastructure and expanding it to include 10 additional contract sales representatives in the U.S. and possibly two sales representatives in Canada focused on gastro-intestinal and cystic fibrosis physicians.
 STENDRA/SPEDRA for the Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction
 ED affects an estimated 52% of men between the ages of 40 and 70. Prevalence increases with age and can be caused by a variety of factors, including medications (anti‑hypertensives, histamine receptor antagonists); lifestyle (tobacco, alcohol use); diseases (diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, prostate cancer); and spinal cord injuries. Left untreated, ED can negatively impact relationships and self‑esteem, causing feelings of embarrassment and guilt.
 STENDRA is an oral PDE5 inhibitor we have licensed from MTPC. STENDRA was approved in the U.S. by FDA on April 27, 2012, for the treatment of ED.
 On September 18, 2014, FDA approved an sNDA for STENDRA. STENDRA is now indicated to be taken as early as approximately 15 minutes before sexual activity. On January 23, 2015, the EC adopted the Commission Implementing Decision amending the marketing authorization for SPEDRA. SPEDRA is now approved in the EU to be taken as needed approximately 15 to 30 minutes before sexual activity.
 We have granted an exclusive license to Menarini to commercialize and promote SPEDRA for the treatment of ED in over 40 European countries, including the EU Member States, plus Australia and New Zealand. We have granted an exclusive license to Metuchen to market STENDRA in the United States, Canada, South America and India. We have also granted an exclusive license to Sanofi to commercialize avanafil in Africa, the Middle East, Turkey, and the CIS, including Russia. We are currently in discussions with potential partners to commercialize STENDRA in other territories where we do not currently have a commercial collaboration under our license with MTPC, including Mexico and Central America.
 On January 3, 2017, we granted Hetero a license to manufacture and commercialize the generic version of STENDRA described in its ANDA filing in the United States as of the date that is the later of (a) October 29, 2024, which is 180 days prior to the expiration of the last to expire of the patents-in-suit, or (b) the date that Hetero obtains final approval from FDA of the Hetero ANDA. The settlement agreement provides for a full settlement of all claims that were asserted in the suit.

 VI-0106 for the Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
 PAH is a chronic, life-threatening disease characterized by elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which are the arteries between the heart and lungs, due to pathologic proliferation of epithelial and vascular smooth muscle cells in the lining of these blood vessels and excess vasoconstriction. Pulmonary blood pressure is normally between 8 and 20 mmHg at rest as measured by right heart catheterization. In patients with PAH, the pressure in the pulmonary artery is greater than 25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg during physical activity.  These high pressures make it difficult for the heart to pump blood through the lungs to be oxygenated.
 The prevalence of PAH varies among specific populations, but it is estimated at between 15 and 50 cases per million adults.  PAH usually develops between the ages of 20 and 60 but can occur at any age, with a mean age of diagnosis around 45 years.  Idiopathic PAH is the most common type, constituting approximately 40% of the total diagnosed PAH cases, and occurs two to four times more frequently in females.  Risk factors for PAH include a family history of PAH, congenital heart disease, connective tissue disease, portal hypertension, sickle cell disease, thyroid disease, HIV infection, and use of certain drugs and toxins.  PAH patients are classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as class I, II, III, or IV, with the most impaired patients being class IV.
 The symptoms of PAH are non-specific and thus are unfortunately most frequently diagnosed when patients have reached an advanced stage of the disease.  Early symptoms may include shortness of breath during routine activity, fatigue, chest pain, racing heartbeat, pain in upper right side of abdomen, and decreased appetite.  As PAH progresses and worsens, symptoms may include feeling light-headed (especially during physical activity), fainting, swelling in the ankles or legs, and bluish lips or skin.  At its worse point, the patient develops right heart failure and is routinely hospitalized to manage their progressing disease which may ultimately lead to death.  Currently, lung transplantation is the only option for patients who are not responsive to medical therapy.
 The current medical therapies for PAH involve endothelin receptor antagonists (“ERA”) phosphodiesterase-5 (“PDE5”) inhibitors, prostacyclin analogues, selective IP receptor agonists, and soluble guanylate cyclase (“sGC”) stimulators, which aim to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.  All currently approved products treat the symptoms of PAH, but do not address the underlying disease.  According to LifeSci Capital (Feb 2016 Analysis), the U.S. and worldwide markets for PAH pharmaceutical treatments in 2015 exceeded $2.7 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively.
 We believe that bone morphogenic protein receptor 2 (“BMPR2”) signaling could inhibit vascular smooth muscle proliferation.  Reduced BMPR2 expression, including loss-of-function mutations in BMPR2, is prevalent in PAH patients and may contribute to smooth muscle proliferation. Studies have shown that low doses of tacrolimus have restored BMPR2 signaling and reversed proliferative effects in animal models. We believe that enhancement of BMPR2 signaling with tacrolimus may address a fundamental cause of PAH.
 On March 16, 2015, tacrolimus for the treatment of PAH received an Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S.  An Orphan Drug Designation can provide benefits to us, such as: tax credits on clinical research, simplification of administrative procedures (reduction of the waiting period and reduction of the amount of registration fees), and marketing exclusivity of seven years after the marketing approval is granted for the approved orphan indication.
 Stanford completed a randomized, double-blind Phase 2a with 23 class I and II PAH patients titrated to target blood levels.  All target blood levels were well tolerated with no drug related serious adverse events, nephrotoxicity or incident diabetes.  In addition, Stanford provided tacrolimus for compassionate use in three class III or IV PAH patients.  The compassionate use demonstrated dramatically reduced rates of hospitalizations and functional class improvements were observed.
 On January 6, 2017, we entered into a Patent Assignment Agreement with Selten, whereby we received exclusive, worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of BMPR2 activators for the treatment of PAH and related vascular diseases.  As part of the agreement, Selten assigned to us its license to a group of patents owned by Stanford which cover uses of tacrolimus and ascomycin to treat PAH. We are responsible for future financial obligations to Stanford under that license.
 We have also assumed full responsibility for the development and commercialization of the licensed compounds for the treatment of PAH and related vascular diseases. We paid Selten an upfront payment of $1.0 million, and we will pay additional milestone payments based on global development status and future sales milestones, as well as tiered royalty payments on future sales of these compounds.  The total potential milestone payments are $39.0 million 

 
  11

 
to Selten and $550,000 to Stanford. The majority of the milestone payments to Selten may be paid, at our sole option, either in cash or our common stock, provided that in no event shall the payment of common stock exceed fifty percent of the aggregate amount of such milestone payments.
 In October 2017, we held a pre-IND meeting with FDA for our proprietary formulation of tacrolimus for the treatment of PAH.  FDA addressed our questions related to preclinical, nonclinical and clinical data and the planned design of clinical trials of tacrolimus in class III and IV PAH patients, and clarified the requirements needed to file an IND to initiate a clinical trial in this indication. As discussed with FDA, we currently intend to design and conduct clinical trials that could qualify for Fast Track and/or Breakthrough Therapy designation and expect to file an IND in 2019.
 Tacrolimus for the treatment of PAH has received Orphan Drug Designation from FDA in the United States and, on August 23, 2017, from the EC (on the basis of a scientific opinion adopted by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency) in the EU. We are currently focusing on the development of a proprietary formulation of tacrolimus to be used in a clinical development program and for commercial use and filing an IND with FDA.
 Other Programs
 We have licensed and will evaluate opportunities to license from third parties the rights to other investigational drug candidates to treat various diseases and medical conditions. We expect to continue to use our expertise in designing and conducting clinical trials, formulation and investigational drug candidate development to commercialize pharmaceuticals for unmet medical needs or for disease states that are underserved by currently approved drugs. We intend to develop products with a proprietary position or that complement our other products currently under development, although there can be no assurance that any of these investigational product candidates will be successfully developed and approved by regulatory authorities. Government Regulations
 FDA Regulation
 Prescription pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre‑ and post‑marketing regulation by FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations govern, among other things, requirements for the testing, development, manufacturing, quality control, safety, efficacy, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of drug products.
 The activities required before a pharmaceutical agent may be marketed in the U.S. begin with pre‑clinical testing. Pre‑clinical tests generally include laboratory evaluation of potential products and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product and its formulations. The results of these studies and other information must be submitted to FDA as part of an investigational new drug application (“IND”) which must be reviewed by FDA before proposed clinical testing in human volunteers can begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices which establishes standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting results of, clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible, accurate, and that the rights, safety and well‑being of study participants are protected. Clinical trials must be under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical study must be conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board (“IRB”). The IRB will consider, among other things, regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from study subjects, as well as other ethical factors and the safety of human patients. The sponsoring company, FDA, or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 Typically, human clinical trials are conducted in three phases that may overlap. In Phase 1, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of patients to determine the early safety profile and pharmacology of the new therapy. In Phase 2, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease or medical condition in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In Phase 3, large‑scale, 

 
  12

 
multicenter clinical trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease or medical condition in order to provide substantial evidence of efficacy and safety required by FDA and others.
 The results of the pre‑clinical and clinical testing, together with chemistry and manufacturing information, are submitted to FDA in the form of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for a pharmaceutical product in order to obtain approval to commence commercial sales. In responding to an NDA, FDA may grant marketing approval or may request additional information or further research or studies if it determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria. FDA approval for a pharmaceutical product may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Under the goals and policies agreed to by FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) FDA has approximately twelve months in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and approximately eight months for a priority NDA. FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates and in certain circumstances, the review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended. A subsequent application for approval of an additional indication must also be reviewed by FDA under the same criteria as apply to original applications, and may not be approved as well. In addition, even if FDA approval is granted, it may not cover all the clinical indications for which approval is sought or may contain significant limitations in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications with respect to conditions of use. In addition, FDA may require the development and implementation of a REMS to address specific safety issues at the time of approval or after marketing of the product. A REMS may, for instance, restrict distribution and impose burdensome implementation requirements. Our approved product Qsymia is subject to a REMS program.
 Satisfaction of FDA premarket approval requirements for new drugs typically takes several years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or targeted disease. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and may impose costly procedures upon our activities. Success in early‑stage clinical trials or with prior versions of products does not assure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.
 Once approved, products are subject to continuing regulation by FDA. FDA may withdraw the product approval based on new information regarding the safety or efficacy of the product or if compliance with post‑marketing regulatory obligations is not maintained. In addition, FDA may require companies to conduct post‑marketing studies or trials, referred to as PMRs, to evaluate safety issues related to the approved product, and may withdraw approval or impose marketing restrictions based on the results of PMR studies or trials or other relevant data. FDA has required us to perform PMR studies and trials for both of our approved products, Qsymia and STENDRA. FDA has broad post‑market regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy civil monetary penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, or withdraw approvals. Additionally, all applicable clinical trials we conduct for our investigational drug candidates, both before and after approval, and the results of those applicable clinical trials when available, are required to be included in a clinical trials registry database that is available and accessible to the public via the Internet. Our failure to properly participate in the clinical trial database registry may subject us to significant civil penalties.
 Facilities used to manufacture drugs are subject to periodic inspection by FDA, and other authorities where applicable, and must comply with FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations. Compliance with cGMP includes adhering to requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, and records and reports. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product.
 FDA imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among other things, standards and regulations relating to direct‑to‑consumer advertising, off‑label promotion, industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by FDA. FDA has very broad enforcement authority. Failure to abide by these regulations can result in adverse publicity, and/or enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter directing the entity to correct deviations from FDA standards, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that 

 
  13

 
could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.
 Companies that manufacture or distribute drug products or that hold approved NDAs must comply with other regulatory requirements, including submitting annual reports, reporting information about adverse drug experiences, and maintaining certain records. In addition, we are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our manufacture and research. In each of these areas, as noted above, the government has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect upon us.
 Other Government Regulations
 In addition to laws and regulations enforced by FDA, we are also subject to regulation under NIH guidelines as well as under the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”) and implementing regulations from the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future federal, state or local laws and regulations, as our research and development may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, viruses and various radioactive compounds. As a Schedule IV controlled substance under the CSA, Qsymia is subject to DEA and state regulations relating to controlled substances including security requirements, record-keeping and certain reporting obligations as well as prescription procedures and limitations on prescription refills. In addition, the parties who perform our clinical and commercial manufacturing, distribution, dispensing and clinical studies for Qsymia are required to maintain necessary DEA registrations and state licenses. The DEA periodically inspects facilities for compliance with its rules and regulations.
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we or our partners are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials, commercial sales, and distribution of our investigational drug candidates. We or our partners must obtain separate approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we or our partners can commence marketing of the product in those countries. For example, in the EU, the conduct of clinical trials is governed by Directive 2001/20/EC which imposes obligations and procedures that are similar to those provided in applicable U.S. laws. The European Union Good Clinical Practice rules and EU Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) obligations must also be respected during conduct of the trials. Clinical trials must be approved by the competent authorities and the competent Ethics Committees in the EU Member States in which the clinical trials take place. A clinical trial application (“CTA”) must be submitted to each EU Member State’s national health authority. Moreover, an application for a positive opinion must be submitted to the competent Ethics Committee prior to commencement of clinical trials of a medicinal product. The competent authorities of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is conducted must authorize the conduct of the trial and the competent Ethics Committees must grant their positive opinion prior to commencement of a clinical trial in an EU Member State. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Although Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive in a manner that is not always uniform. This has led to variations in the rules governing the conduct of clinical trials in the individual EU Member States. The EU legislator adopted Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (the “Clinical Trials Regulation”) in 2014. The new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, which will replace the EU Clinical Trials Directive, introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU, including a new coordinated procedure for authorization of clinical trials that is reminiscent of the mutual recognition procedure for marketing authorization of medicinal products, and increased obligations on sponsors to publish clinical trial results. The Clinical Trials Regulation is expected to start to apply in 2020. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 To obtain marketing authorization for a medicinal product in the EU, we would be required to submit marketing authorization applications based on the ICH Common Technical Document to the competent authorities, and must demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of our medicinal products. This would require us to conduct human clinical trials to generate the necessary clinical data. Moreover, we would be required to demonstrate in our application that studies have been conducted with the medicinal product in the pediatric population as provided by a Pediatric 

 
  14

 
Investigation Plan (“PIP”) approved by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA. Alternatively, confirmation that we have been granted a waiver or deferral from the conduct of these studies by the PDCO must be provided.
 Medicinal products are authorized in the EU in one of two ways, either by the competent authorities of the EU Member States through the decentralized procedure, mutual recognition procedure or national procedure (single EU Member State), or through the centralized procedure by the European Commission following a positive opinion by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the EMA. The authorization process is essentially the same irrespective of which route is used.
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association (“EFTA”) countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, advanced therapy medicinal products, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. It is optional for those products that are containing a new active substance that is not yet authorized in the EEA or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which grant of centralized marketing authorization is in the interest of patients in the EU. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases. These are defined as circumstances in which a medicinal product is expected to be of a “major public health interest.” Three cumulative criteria must be fulfilled in such circumstances: the seriousness of the disease, such as heavy disabling or life‑threatening diseases, to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In these circumstances, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
 The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other (“concerned”) EU Member States of an assessment of an application for marketing authorization conducted by one EU Member State, known as the reference EU Member State. In accordance with this procedure, an applicant submits an application for marketing authorization to the reference EU Member State and the concerned EU Member States. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the Heads of Medicines Agencies (“CMDh”) for review. This review, which may also be escalated to the CHMP in case of disagreement in CMDh would result in a decision by the European Commission. This decision is binding on all EU Member States. In accordance with the mutual recognition procedure, the company applies for national marketing authorization in one EU Member State. The mutual recognition procedure allows companies that have a medicinal product already authorized in one EU Member State to apply for this authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU Member States. The national marketing authorization procedure is founded on the same basic EU regulatory process as the other marketing authorization procedures discussed in this Section. The national marketing authorization procedure, which is increasingly rare, permits a company to submit an application to the competent authority of a single EU Member State and, if successful, to obtain a marketing authorization that is valid only in this EU Member State.
 The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application in the EU is 210 days. This period does not include clock stops during which applicants respond to questions from the competent authority. The initial marketing authorization granted in the EU is valid for five years. The authorization may be renewed and remain valid for an unlimited period unless the national competent authority or the European Commission decides on justified grounds to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. The renewal of a marketing authorization is subject to a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of the product by the national competent authorities or the EMA.
 Innovative medicinal products authorized in the EU on the basis of a full marketing authorization application (as opposed to an application for marketing authorization that relies on data available in the marketing authorization dossier for another, previously approved, medicinal product) are entitled to eight years’ data exclusivity. During this period, applicants for authorization of generics or biosimilars of these innovative products cannot rely on data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product. Innovative medicinal products are also entitled to ten years’ market exclusivity. During this ten-year period no generic or biosimilar of this medicinal product can be placed on the EU market. The ten‑year period of market exclusivity can be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the Marketing Authorization Holder for the innovative product 

 
  15

 
obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 Similar to the U.S., marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and/or the competent authorities of the EU Member States. This oversight applies both before and after grant of manufacturing and marketing authorizations. It includes control of compliance with EU GMP rules and pharmacovigilance rules requiring marketing authorization holders to conduct pharmacovigilance activities, and to assess and monitor the safety of medicinal products. We cannot guarantee that we or Menarini, as the marketing authorization holder for SPEDRA in the EU, would be able to comply with the post‑marketing obligations imposed as part of the marketing authorization for SPEDRA. Failure to comply with these requirements may lead to the suspension, variation or withdrawal of the marketing authorization for SPEDRA in the EU.
 Various requirements apply to the manufacturing and placing on the EU market of medicinal products.  Manufacture of medicinal products in the EU requires a manufacturing authorization. The manufacturing authorization holder must comply with requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and APIs. These obligations extend to the manufacture of APIs outside of the EU for import into the EU. Similarly, the distribution of medicinal products into and within the EU is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. Marketing authorization holders may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including suspension of manufacturing authorization, in case of non-compliance with the EU or EU Member States’ requirements applicable to the manufacturing of medicinal products. 
 In the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products will also be subject to EU Member States’ laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EU Member State legislation that may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics (“SmPC”) as approved by the competent authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. It forms an intrinsic and integral part of the marketing authorization granted for the medicinal product. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off‑label promotion. The off‑label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The applicable laws at the EU level and in the individual EU Member States also prohibit the direct‑to‑consumer advertising of prescription‑only medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict communications concerning the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
 Failure to comply with the EU Member State laws implementing the Community Code on medicinal products, and EU rules governing the promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, with the EU Member State laws that apply to the promotion of medicinal products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti‑corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the EU Member State authorities, which may include any of the following: fines, imprisonment, orders forfeiting products or prohibiting or suspending their supply to the market, or requiring the manufacturer to issue public warnings, or to conduct a product recall.
 Interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self‑regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct in the individual EU Member States. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti‑bribery laws of the EU Member States. One example is the UK Bribery Act 2010. This Act applies to any company incorporated in or “carrying on business” in the UK, irrespective of where in the world the alleged bribery activity occurs. This Act could have implications for our interactions with physicians in and outside the UK. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
 Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publically disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her 

 
  16

 
competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
 United States Healthcare Reform
 In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to in this report as the “Affordable Care Act,” was adopted in the United States. This law has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions that are expected to impact our business and operations. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, expansion of the 340B drug pricing program, and fraud and abuse and enforcement. These changes have impacted and will continue to impact existing government healthcare programs and have resulted in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program.
 The Affordable Care Act made significant changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Effective March 23, 2010, rebate liability expanded from fee‑for‑service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well. The Affordable Care Act also made changes to the 340B drug pricing program, which are described below under the heading “Coverage and Reimbursement.”  With regard to the amount of the rebates owed, the Affordable Care Act increased the minimum Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price for most innovator products and from 11% to 13% for non‑innovator products; changed the calculation of the rebate for certain innovator products that qualify as line extensions of existing drugs; and capped the total rebate amount at 100 percent of the average manufacturer price. In addition, the Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation changed the definition of average manufacturer price. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the federal agency that administers Medicare and the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, issued final regulations that became effective on April 1, 2016 to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. In addition, the Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay an annual, nondeductible branded prescription drug fee to the federal government beginning in 2011, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee does not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee of $2.8 billion in 2019 and thereafter, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law.
 Additional provisions of the Affordable Care Act may negatively affect our revenues in the future. For example, as part of the Affordable Care Act’s provisions closing a coverage gap that currently exists in most Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole,” manufacturers were required to provide a 50 percent discount on branded prescription drugs dispensed to beneficiaries during their “donut hole” period as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (“BBA”) increased such manufacturer point-of-sale discounts to 70 percent effective as of January 1, 2019. We currently have limited coverage under Medicare Part D for our drugs, but coverage could increase in the future.
 Some of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be fully implemented, and certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. In addition, there have been efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act and to alter the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and related laws. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly referred to as the “individual mandate,” effective January 1, 2019. On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, and judicial challenges related to the Affordable Care Act remain possible. It is unclear how the Affordable Care Act and its 

 
  17

 
implementation, as well as efforts to repeal or replace, or invalidate, the Affordable Care Act, or portions thereof, will affect our business.  It is possible that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our existing products or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved.
 Some states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs by raising the income limit to 133% of the federal poverty level as permitted under the Affordable Care Act. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact our sales, business and financial condition.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 In both U.S. and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our products successfully and to attract commercialization partners for our products, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third‑party payors, including, in the United States, governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. Third‑party payors decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement and co‑pay levels. Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medicines and examining their cost‑effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost‑effectiveness of our products. Even with studies, our products may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost‑effective than existing products, and third‑party payors may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, in whole or in part.
 Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. We anticipate that the United States Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost‑containment measures include: controls on government funded reimbursement for drugs; new or increased requirements to pay prescription drug rebates to government healthcare programs; controls on healthcare providers; challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means; requirements to try less expensive products or generics before a more expensive branded product; changes in drug importation laws; expansion of use of managed care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person; and public funding for cost‑effectiveness research, which may be used by government and private third‑party payors to make coverage and payment decisions. Further, federal budgetary concerns could result in the implementation of significant federal spending cuts, including cuts in Medicare and other health related spending in the near‑term. For example, beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs and biologics, were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2027.  These cuts reduce reimbursement payments related to our products, which could potentially negatively impact our revenue.
 Payors also are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price and Actual Acquisition Cost. CMS surveys and publishes retail community pharmacy acquisition cost information in the form of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost files to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. It is difficult to project the impact of these evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of payors to cover our products.
 We participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and amended by the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 as well as subsequent legislation. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug, which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the U.S. in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, 

 
  18

 
discounts and other price concessions. Our failure to comply with these price reporting and rebate payment options could negatively impact our financial results.
 Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low‑income patients. The Affordable Care Act expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities: certain free standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, each as defined by the Affordable Care Act, but exempts “orphan drugs” from the ceiling price requirements for these covered entities. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Changes to the definition of average manufacturer price and the Medicaid Drug Rebate amount under the Affordable Care Act or otherwise also could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations.
 The Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”), which administers the 340B program, issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities, which became effective on January 1, 2019.  It is currently unclear how HRSA will apply its enforcement authority under the new regulation.  Implementation of this final rule and the issuance of any other final regulations and guidance could affect our obligations under the 340B program in ways we cannot anticipate.  HRSA also is implementing a 340B ceiling price reporting requirement during the first quarter of 2019 pursuant to which we are required to report the 340B ceiling prices for our covered outpatient drugs to HRSA on a quarterly basis.   In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in the inpatient setting.
 Pricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. The Medicaid rebate amount is computed each quarter based on our submission to CMS of our current average manufacturer prices and best prices for the quarter. If we become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. Price recalculations also may affect the 340B ceiling price at which we are required to offer our products to certain covered entities, and we may be required to issue refunds to covered entities.
 We are liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. Civil monetary penalties can be applied if we are found to have charged 340B covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price. In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false average manufacturer price or best price information to the government, we may be liable for significant civil monetary penalties per item of false information. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly average manufacturer price and best price data on a timely basis could result in a significant civil monetary penalty per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failure also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, no federal payments would be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs.
 CMS and the Office of the Inspector General have pursued manufacturers that were alleged to have failed to report these data to the government in a timely manner. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. We cannot assure you that our submissions will not be found by CMS to be incomplete or incorrect.
 In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and certain federal grantees, we participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) pricing program, established by Section 603 of the Veterans 

 
  19

 
Health Care Act of 1992. Under this program, we are obligated to make our product available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies—VA, Department of Defense, Public Health Service, and Coast Guard—that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price (“FCP”). The FCP is based on the non‑federal average manufacturer price (“Non‑FAMP”) which we calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. We also participate in the Tricare Retail Pharmacy program, established by Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2008, and related regulations, under which we pay quarterly rebates on utilization of innovator products that are dispensed to Tricare beneficiaries through Tricare retail network pharmacies. The rebates are calculated as the difference between Annual Non‑FAMP and FCP.
 We expect to experience pricing pressures in the United States in connection with the sale of our products due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals. In various EU countries, we expect to be subject to continuous cost‑cutting measures, such as lower maximum prices, lower or lack of reimbursement coverage and incentives to use cheaper, usually generic, products as an alternative.
 We are unable to predict what additional legislation, regulations or policies, if any, relating to the healthcare industry or third‑party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation, regulations or policies would have on our business. Any cost‑containment measures, including those listed above, or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate profitably.
 Once an applicant receives marketing authorization in an EU Member State, through any application route, the applicant is then required to engage in pricing discussions and negotiations with a separate pricing authority in that country. The legislators, policymakers and healthcare insurance funds in the EU Member States continue to propose and implement cost‑containing measures to keep healthcare costs down, due in part to the attention being paid to healthcare cost‑containment and other austerity measures in the EU. Certain of these changes could impose limitations on the prices pharmaceutical companies are able to charge for their products. The amounts of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or third‑party payors for these products may increase the tax obligations on pharmaceutical companies such as ours, or may facilitate the introduction of generic competition with respect to our products. Furthermore, an increasing number of EU Member States and other foreign countries use prices for medicinal products established in other countries as “reference prices” to help determine the price of the product in their own territory. Consequently, a downward trend in prices of medicinal products in some countries could contribute to similar downward trends elsewhere. In addition, the ongoing budgetary difficulties faced by a number of EU Member States, including Greece and Spain, have led and may continue to lead to substantial delays in payment and payment partially with government bonds rather than cash for medicinal products, which could negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Moreover, in order to obtain reimbursement of our medicinal products in some countries, including some EU Member States, we may be required to conduct Health Technology Assessments (“HTAs”) that compare the cost‑effectiveness of our products to other available therapies. There can be no assurance that our medicinal products will obtain favorable reimbursement status in any country.
 In the EU, the sole legal instrument at the EU level governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products is Council Directive 89/105/EEC (the “Price Transparency Directive”). The aim of this Directive is to ensure that pricing and reimbursement mechanisms established in the EU Member States are transparent and objective, do not hinder the free movement and trade of medicinal products in the EU and do not hinder, prevent or distort competition on the market. The Price Transparency Directive does not provide any guidance concerning the specific criteria on the basis of which pricing and reimbursement decisions are to be made in individual EU Member States. Neither does it have any direct consequence for pricing nor reimbursement levels in individual EU Member States. The EU Member States are free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices and/or reimbursement levels of medicinal products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the medicinal product, or alternatively adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company responsible for placing the medicinal product on the market, including volume‑based arrangements and reference pricing mechanisms.
 HTA of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States. These EU Member States include the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Sweden. The HTA process in the EEA Member States is governed by the national laws of these countries. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and 

 
  20

 
societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost‑effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market.
 The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product vary between EU Member States. A negative HTA by a leading and recognized HTA body concerning one of our medicinal products could not only undermine our ability to obtain reimbursement for such product not only in the EU Member State in which the negative assessment was issued, but also in other EU Member States. For example, EU Member States that have not yet developed HTA mechanisms could rely to some extent on the HTA performed in countries with a developed HTA framework, such as France, Germany or Sweden, when adopting decisions concerning the pricing and reimbursement of a specific medicinal product.
 In 2011, Directive 2011/24/EU was adopted at the EU level. This Directive concerns the application of patients’ rights in cross‑border healthcare. The Directive is intended to establish rules for facilitating access to safe and high‑quality cross‑border healthcare in the EU. It also provides for the establishment of a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual EU Member States. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This could lead to harmonization between EU Member States of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTA and their impact on pricing and reimbursement decisions.
 On January 31, 2018, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on HTA. This legislative proposal is intended to boost cooperation among EU Member States in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and providing the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The proposal provides that EU Member States will be able to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU Member States will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement. The European Commission has stated that the role of the draft HTA regulation is not to influence pricing and reimbursement decisions in the individual EU Member States. However, this consequence cannot be excluded.
 Fraud and Abuse and Privacy and Data Security Laws and Regulations
 The healthcare industry, and thus our business, is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change. Both federal and state governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts.
 The restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and privacy and data security laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:

· | the federal healthcare Anti‑Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly or willingly offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare items or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Liability under the Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute protecting certain
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  21

 

common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exemption or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny. Moreover, the anti-kickback statute is subject to evolving interpretation and there are no safe harbors for many common practices, including patient or product support programs, educational and research grants, or charitable donations. We seek to comply with the exemptions and safe harbors whenever possible, but our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti‑kickback liability;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal civil False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties against individuals and entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the U.S. Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Many pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the civil False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper marketing activities, including providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing consulting fees, grants, free travel, and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe the company’s products; and inflating prices reported to private price publication services, which are used to set drug payment rates under government healthcare programs. In addition, in recent years the government has pursued civil False Claims Act cases against a number of pharmaceutical companies for causing false claims to be submitted as a result of the marketing of their products for unapproved, and thus non‑reimbursable, uses. More recently, federal enforcement agencies are and have been investigating certain pharmaceutical companies’ product and patient assistance programs, including manufacturer reimbursement support services, relationships with specialty pharmacies, and grants to independent charitable foundations. False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory penalties per false or fraudulent claim or statement. Because of the potential for large monetary exposure, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claim laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non‑government health benefit programs;

· | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HIPAA”) imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information. In addition, most healthcare providers who prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) which are collectively referred to as “HIPAA.” We are not a HIPAA‑covered entity and we do not operate as a business associate to any covered entities. Therefore, the HIPAA privacy and security requirements do not apply to us (other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits). However, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or for aiding and abetting and/or conspiring to commit a violation of HIPAA. We are unable to predict whether our actions could be subject to prosecution in the event of an impermissible disclosure of health information to us. In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) was signed into law on June 28, 2018 and largely takes effect January 1, 2020. The law contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about California residents and affords those individuals new rights relating to their personal information that may

affect our ability to use personal information. The CCPA has substantial penalties for non-compliance, and we continue to assess its impact on our business. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information. The collection and use of personal health data and other personal data in the EU is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), an EU-wide regulation that became fully enforceable on May 25, 2018, replacing the EU Data Protection Directive, imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. The GDPR imposes restrictions on the processing (e.g., collection, use, disclosure) of personal data, including a number of requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals prior to processing their personal data, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. GDPR also imposes strict restrictions on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the United States. These obligations and restrictions concern, in particular, the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relate, the information provided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the EEA or Switzerland, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data, as well as substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in substantial fines and other administrative penalties. Compliance with GDPR may be onerous and increase our cost of doing business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data security continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data security issues with the potential to affect our business. These privacy and data security laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Moreover, patients about whom we or our partners obtain information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may have contractual rights that limit our ability to use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals' privacy rights or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business;

· | analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Some state laws also require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to certain healthcare providers in the states. Other states prohibit providing meals to prescribers or other marketing‑related activities and restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. Some states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states and cities require identification or licensing of sales representatives. In addition, some states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct. Foreign governments often have similar regulations, which we also will be subject to in those countries where we market and sell products;

· | the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain pharmaceutical manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“CMS”) information related payments and other transfers of value, directly or indirectly, to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives; and

intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in anti‑bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. and foreign regulators, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with United States or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third‑party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or government investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws or regulations described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative mandatory penalties, imprisonment, damages, fines, exclusion from government‑funded healthcare programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws and regulations, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, data security and fraud laws and regulations may prove costly.
 Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may interpret the GDPR and applicable related national laws differently and impose requirements additional to those provided in the GDPR. In addition, guidance on implementation and compliance practices may be updated or otherwise revised, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU. When processing personal data of subjects in the EU, we must comply with the applicable data protection laws. In particular, when we rely on third party services providers processing personal data of subjects in the EU we must enter into suitable agreements with these providers and receive sufficient guarantees that the providers meet the requirements of the applicable data protection laws, particularly the GDPR which imposes specific and relevant obligations.
 Although there are legal mechanisms to allow for the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the US, a decision of the European Court of Justice in the Schrems case (Case C-362/14 Maximillian Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner) that invalidated the safe harbor framework has increased uncertainty around compliance with EU privacy law requirements. As a result of the decision, it was no longer possible to rely on the safe harbor certification as a legal basis for the transfer of personal data from the EU to entities in the US. On February 29, 2016, however, the European Commission announced an agreement with the United States Department of Commerce (“DOC”) to replace the invalidated Safe Harbor framework with a new EU-US “Privacy Shield.” On July 12, 2016, the European Commission adopted a decision on the adequacy of the protection provided by the Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield is intended to address the requirements set out by the European Court of Justice in its ruling by imposing more stringent obligations on companies, providing stronger monitoring and enforcement by the DOC and Federal Trade Commission, and making commitments on the part of public authorities regarding access to information. US companies have been able to certify to the US Department of Commerce their compliance with the privacy principles of the Privacy Shield since August 1, 2016. 
 On September 16, 2016, an Irish privacy advocacy group brought an action for annulment of the EC decision on the adequacy of the Privacy Shield before the European Court of Justice (Case T-670/16). In October 2016, a further action for annulment was brought by three French digital rights advocacy groups (Case T-738/16). Case T-670/16 was declared inadmissible. Case T-738/16 is still pending before the European Court of Justice. The United States was admitted as an intervener in the action on September 4, 2018. If the European Court of Justice invalidates the Privacy Shield, it will no longer be possible to rely on the Privacy Shield certification to support transfer of personal data from the EU to entities in the US. Adherence to the Privacy Shield is not, however, mandatory. US-based companies are permitted to rely either on their adherence to the Privacy Shield or on the other authorized means and procedures to transfer personal data provided by the GDPR. If we or our vendors fail to comply with applicable data privacy laws, or if the legal mechanisms we or our vendors rely upon to allow for the transfer of personal data from the EEA or Switzerland to the US (or other countries not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection) are not considered adequate, we could be subject to government enforcement actions and significant penalties

against us, and our business could be adversely impacted if our ability to transfer personal data outside of the EEA or Switzerland is restricted, which could adversely impact our operating results.
 Collaboration Agreements
 Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation
 In January 2001, we entered into an exclusive development, license and clinical trial and commercial supply agreement with MTPC for the development and commercialization of avanafil, a PDE5 inhibitor compound for the oral and local treatment of male and female sexual dysfunction. Under the terms of the agreement, MTPC agreed to grant an exclusive license to us for products containing avanafil outside of Japan, North Korea, South Korea, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. We agreed to grant MTPC an exclusive, royalty‑free license within those countries for oral products that we develop containing avanafil. In addition, we agreed to grant MTPC an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive, royalty‑bearing license within those countries for non‑oral products that we develop containing avanafil. The MTPC agreement contains a number of milestone payments to be made by us based on various triggering events.
 The term of the MTPC agreement is based on a country‑by‑country and on a product‑by‑product basis. The term shall continue until the later of 10 years after the date of the first sale for a particular product or the expiration of the last‑to‑expire patents within the MTPC patents covering such product in such country. In the event that our product is deemed to be insufficiently effective or insufficiently safe relative to other PDE5 inhibitor compounds based on published information or not economically feasible to develop due to unforeseen regulatory hurdles or costs as measured by standards common in the pharmaceutical industry for this type of product, we have the right to terminate the agreement with MTPC with respect to such product.
 In August 2012, we entered into an amendment to our agreement with MTPC that permits us to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and tablets for STENDRA ourselves or through third parties. In 2015, we transferred the manufacturing of the API and tablets for STENDRA to Sanofi.
 On February 21, 2013, we entered into the third amendment to our agreement with MTPC which, among other things, expands our rights, or those of our sublicensees, to enforce the patents licensed under the MTPC agreement against alleged infringement, and clarifies the rights and duties of the parties and our sublicensees upon termination of the MTPC agreement. In addition, we were obligated to use our best commercial efforts to market STENDRA in the U.S. by December 31, 2013, which was achieved.
 On July 23, 2013, we entered into the fourth amendment to our agreement with MTPC which, among other things, changes the definition of net sales used to calculate royalties owed by us to MTPC.
 Menarini Group
 On July 5, 2013, we entered into a license and commercialization agreement (the “Menarini License Agreement”) and a supply agreement (the “Menarini Supply Agreement”) with the Menarini Group through its subsidiary Berlin‑Chemie AG (“Menarini”).
 Under the terms of the Menarini License Agreement, Menarini received an exclusive license to commercialize and promote our drug SPEDRA for the treatment of ED in over 40 countries, including the EU, plus Australia and New Zealand. Additionally, we agreed to transfer to Menarini ownership of the marketing authorization for SPEDRA in the EU for the treatment of ED, which was granted by the EC in June 2013. Each party agreed not to develop, commercialize, or in‑license any other product that operates as phosphodiesterase type‑5 inhibitor for the treatment of ED for a limited time period, subject to certain exceptions.
 Under the Menarini License Agreement, we have received payments of $52.4 million relating to license and milestone payments through December 31, 2018. Additionally, we are entitled to receive potential milestone payments based on certain net sales targets, plus royalties on SPEDRA sales. Menarini will also reimburse us for payments made to cover various obligations to MTPC during the term of the Menarini License Agreement. The Menarini License Agreement will terminate on a country‑by‑country basis in the relevant territories upon the latest to occur of the following: (i) the expiration of the last‑to‑expire valid VIVUS patent covering SPEDRA; (ii) the expiration of data protection covering SPEDRA; or (iii) 10 years after the SPEDRA product launch. In addition, Menarini may terminate 

 
  25

 
the Menarini License Agreement if certain additional regulatory obligations are imposed on SPEDRA, and we may terminate the Menarini License Agreement if Menarini challenges our patents covering SPEDRA or if Menarini commits certain legal violations. Either party may terminate the Menarini License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy.
 Under the terms of the Menarini Supply Agreement, we supplied Menarini with STENDRA drug product until December 31, 2018. Menarini also has the right to manufacture STENDRA independently, provided that it continues to satisfy certain minimum purchase obligations to us. Following the expiration of the Menarini Supply Agreement, Menarini is responsible for its own supply of STENDRA. Either party may terminate the Menarini Supply Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy, or upon the termination of the Menarini License Agreement.
 Sanofi
 On December 11, 2013, we entered into the Sanofi License Agreement with Sanofi. Under the terms of the Sanofi License Agreement, Sanofi received an exclusive license to commercialize and promote avanafil for therapeutic use in humans in the Sanofi Territory. Under the Sanofi License Agreement, we have received payments of $10.0 million relating to license and milestone payments through December 31, 2018.
 On July 31, 2013, we entered into a Commercial Supply Agreement with Sanofi Chimie to manufacture and supply the API for our drug avanafil on an exclusive basis in the United States and other territories and on a semi‑exclusive basis in Europe, including the EU, Latin America and other territories. On November 18, 2013, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Sanofi Winthrop Industrie to manufacture and supply the avanafil tablets on an exclusive basis in the United States and other territories and on a semi‑exclusive basis in Europe, including the EU, Latin America and other territories. We have obtained approval from FDA and the EMA for Sanofi Chimie to be a qualified supplier of avanafil API and of Sanofi Winthrop Industrie as a qualified supplier of the avanafil tablets.

On December 7, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the Commercial Supply Agreement with Sanofi Chimie, pursuant to which certain amendments were made to the Commercial Supply Agreement, which include: (i) beginning January 1, 2019, Sanofi Chimie will manufacture and supply API for avanafil on an exclusive basis in all countries where we have the right to sell avanafil; (ii) beginning January 1, 2019, the yearly minimum quantities of API that we must purchase from Sanofi Chimie will be adjusted, as well as adjustments to the associated pricing and payment terms; and (iii) with the initial five year term of the Commercial Supply Agreement expiring on December 31, 2018, we and Sanofi Chimie have agreed to extend the term of the Commercial Supply Agreement until December 31, 2023 unless either party makes a timely election to terminate the agreement and that thereafter the Commercial Supply Agreement will auto-renew for successive one year terms unless either party makes a timely election not to renew.
 In March 2017, we and Sanofi entered into the Termination, Rights Reversion and Transition Services Agreement (the “Transition Agreement”) effective February 28, 2017. Under the Transition Agreement, effective upon the thirtieth day following February 28, 2017, the Sanofi License Agreement terminated for all countries in the Sanofi Territory as a termination by Sanofi for convenience notwithstanding any notice requirements contained in the Sanofi License Agreement. The Commercial Supply Agreement and the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement will continue in effect. In addition, under the Transition Agreement, Sanofi will provide us with certain transition services in support of ongoing regulatory approval efforts while we seek to obtain a new commercial partner or partners for the Sanofi Territory. We will pay certain transition service fees to Sanofi as part of the Transition Agreement.
 Metuchen Pharmaceuticals, LLC
 On September 30, 2016, we entered into the Metuchen License Agreement and the Metuchen Supply Agreement with Metuchen. Under the terms of the Metuchen License Agreement, Metuchen received an exclusive, license to develop, commercialize and promote STENDRA in the Metuchen Territory, effective October 1, 2016. We and Metuchen have agreed not to develop, commercialize, or in-license any other product that operates as a PDE-5 inhibitor in the Metuchen Territory for a limited time period, subject to certain exceptions. The license agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last-to-expire payment obligations under the license agreement; upon expiration of the term of the license agreement, the exclusive license granted under the license agreement shall become fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable as to us but not certain trademark royalties due to MTPC.

 
  26

 

 Metuchen will obtain STENDRA exclusively from us for a mutually agreed term pursuant to the supply agreement. Metuchen may elect to transfer the control of the supply chain for STENDRA for the Metuchen Territory to itself or its designee by assigning to Metuchen our agreements with the contract manufacturer. For 2016 and each subsequent calendar year during the term of the supply agreement, if Metuchen fails to purchase an agreed minimum purchase amount of STENDRA from us, it will reimburse us for the shortfall as it relates to our out of pocket costs to acquire certain raw materials needed to manufacture STENDRA. Upon the termination of the supply agreement (other than by Metuchen for our uncured material breach or upon completion of the transfer of the control of the supply chain), Metuchen’s agreed minimum purchase amount of STENDRA from us shall accelerate for the entire then current initial term or renewal term, as applicable. The initial term under the Supply Agreement will be for a period of five years, with automatic renewal for successive two-year periods unless either party provides a termination notice to the other party at least two years in advance of the expiration of the then current term. On September 30, 2016, we received $70 million from Metuchen under the license agreement. Metuchen will also reimburse us for payments made to cover royalty and milestone obligations to MTPC during the term of the license agreement, but will otherwise owe us no future royalties.
 Selten Pharma, Inc.
 On January 6, 2017, we entered into a Patent Assignment Agreement with Selten, whereby we received exclusive, worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of BMPR2 activators for the treatment of PAH and related vascular diseases.  As part of the agreement, Selten assigned to us its license to a group of patents owned by Stanford, which cover uses of tacrolimus and ascomycin to treat PAH. We are responsible for future financial obligations to Stanford under that license.
 We have also assumed full responsibility for the development and commercialization of the licensed compounds for the treatment of PAH and related vascular diseases. We paid Selten an upfront payment of $1.0 million, and we will pay additional milestone payments based on global development status and future sales milestones, as well as tiered royalty payments on future sales of these compounds.  The total potential milestone payments are $39.0 million to Selten and $550,000 to Stanford. The majority of the milestone payments to Selten may be paid, at our sole option, either in cash or our common stock, provided that in no event shall the payment of common stock exceed fifty percent of the aggregate amount of such milestone payments.
 Alvogen Malta Operations (ROW) Ltd
 In September 2017, we entered into a license and commercialization agreement (the “Alvogen License Agreement”) and a commercial supply agreement (the “Alvogen Supply Agreement”) with Alvogen Malta Operations (ROW) Ltd (“Alvogen”). Under the terms of the Alvogen License Agreement, Alvogen will be solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for all sales and marketing activities for Qsymia in South Korea. We received an upfront payment of $2.5 million in September 2017, which was recorded in license and milestone revenue in the third quarter of 2017, and are eligible to receive additional payments upon Alvogen achieving marketing authorization, commercial launch and reaching a sales milestone for a potential total of $7.5 million. Additionally, we will receive a royalty on Alvogen’s Qsymia net sales in South Korea. Under the Alvogen Supply Agreement, we will supply product to Alvogen. Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc
 In June 2018, we acquired the commercial rights to PANCREAZE and PANCREASE MT in the U.S. and Canada from Janssen. In connection with the acquisition of PANCREAZE, we and Janssen also entered into transition services agreements pursuant to which Janssen and a Canadian affiliate of Janssen will provide certain transition services to us in the U.S. and Canada as we transition to full control over the PANCREAZE supply chain. The transition in the U.S. occurred in the first quarter of 2019. We commercialize PANCREAZE in the U.S. and Canada by leveraging our existing commercial infrastructure and expanding it to include 10 additional contract sales representatives in the U.S. and possibly two sales representatives in Canada focused on gastro-intestinal and cystic fibrosis physicians. We also entered into a Long-Term Collaboration Agreement with Johnson & Johnson Health Care Systems Inc., a New Jersey corporation and an affiliate of Janssen, pursuant to which they will cooperate in the reporting and certification of pricing and sales data and the payment of rebates and discounts under certain governmental programs.

 Other
 In October 2001, we entered into an assignment agreement (the “Assignment Agreement”) with Thomas Najarian, M.D. for a combination of pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of obesity and other disorders (the “Combination Therapy”) that became the focus of our development program for Qsymia. The Combination Therapy and all related patent applications (the “Combination Therapy Patents”) were transferred to us with worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the Combination Therapy and exploit the Combination Therapy Patents. In addition, the Assignment Agreement requires us to pay royalties on worldwide net sales of a product for the treatment of obesity that is based upon the Combination Therapy and the Combination Therapy Patents until the last‑to‑expire of the assigned Combination Therapy Patents. To the extent that we decide not to commercially exploit the Combination Therapy Patents, the Assignment Agreement will terminate and the Combination Therapy and the Combination Therapy Patents will be assigned back to Dr. Najarian. In 2006, Dr. Najarian joined the Company as a part‑time employee and served as a Principal Scientist. In November 2013, Dr. Najarian’s employment with the Company ended, and he continues to be available as a consultant. Patents, Proprietary Technology and Data Exclusivity
 We own or are the exclusive licensee of more than 30 patents and numerous published patent applications in the U.S. and Canada. We intend to develop, maintain and secure intellectual property rights and to aggressively defend and pursue new patents to expand upon our current patent base. Our portfolio of patents, which primarily relates to Qsymia, our FDA‑approved drug for the treatment of obesity, STENDRA, our FDA‑approved drug for the treatment of ED, and tacrolimus is summarized as follows:

 *These expiration dates are based on the number of days of patent term adjustment (“PTA”) calculated by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). An independent calculation of PTA suggested that the patents may be entitled to fewer days of PTA than determined by the USPTO.
 The EU has adopted a harmonized approach to data and marketing exclusivity under Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 and Directive 2001/83/EC. The exclusivity scheme applies to products that have been authorized in the EU by either the European Commission, through the centralized procedure, or the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) under the Decentralized, Mutual Recognition or national procedures. The approach (known as the 8+2+1 formula) permits eight years of data exclusivity and 10 years of marketing exclusivity. Within the first eight years of the 10 years, an applicant for a marketing authorization for a generic or biosimilar medicinal product is not permitted to cross refer to the preclinical and clinical trial data relating to the reference product. Even if the generic or biosimilar product is authorized after expiry of the eight years of data exclusivity, it cannot be placed on the market until the full 10‑year market exclusivity has expired. This 10‑year market exclusivity may be extended cumulatively to a maximum period of 11 years if during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for a new (second) therapeutic indication which, during the scientific evaluation prior to its authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 In addition to the Canadian patents identified in the table, we also hold foreign counterparts, patents and patent applications in major foreign jurisdictions related to our U.S. patents. We have developed and acquired exclusive rights to patented technology in support of our development and commercialization of our approved drugs and investigational drug candidates, and we rely on trade secrets and proprietary technologies in developing potential drugs. We continue to place significant emphasis on securing global intellectual property rights and are aggressively pursuing new patents to expand upon our strong foundation for commercializing investigational drug candidates in development.
 Manufacturing
 Our commercial products, Qsymia, PANCREAZE and STENDRA, together with their respective APIs and finished products, as well as our clinical supplies, are manufactured on a contract basis. In addition, packaging for the commercial distribution of the Qsymia and PANCREAZE product capsules and the STENDRA product tablets is performed by contract packaging companies. We expect to continue to contract with other third‑party providers for manufacturing services, including APIs, finished products, and packaging operations as needed. We believe that our current agreements and purchase orders with third‑party manufacturers provide for sufficient operating capacity to support the anticipated commercial demand for Qsymia, PANCREAZE and STENDRA and our clinical supplies. However, if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of Qsymia, PANCREAZE or STENDRA for our commercial sales, or the clinical supplies to support our clinical trials, or if we should encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with our manufacturers or packagers, we may lose potential sales, have difficulty entering into collaboration agreements for the commercialization of STENDRA for territories in which we do not have a commercial collaboration or our clinical trials may be delayed.
 Catalent Pharma Solutions, LLC (“Catalent”) manufactures our clinical and commercial supplies for Qsymia. Catalent has been successful in validating the commercial manufacturing process for Qsymia at a scale that has been able to support the launch of Qsymia in the U.S. market.
 In connection with the acquisition of PANCREAZE, we and Janssen also entered into transition services agreements pursuant to which Janssen and a Canadian affiliate of Janssen will provide certain transition services to us in the U.S. and Canada as we transition to full control over the PANCREAZE supply chain. The transition in the U.S. occurred in the first quarter of 2019. Nordmark Arzneimittel GmbH & Co. KG (“Nordmark”) is the Company’s sole source of clinical and commercial supplies for PANCREAZE.
 On July 31, 2013, we entered into a Commercial Supply Agreement with Sanofi Chimie, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi, pursuant to which Sanofi Chimie manufactures and supplies the API for STENDRA. On November 18, 2013, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Sanofi Winthrop Industrie, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi, pursuant to which Sanofi Winthrop Industrie manufactures and supplies the tablets for avanafil.

 We currently do not have any manufacturing facilities and intend to continue to rely on third parties for the supply of the starting materials, API and finished dosage forms (tablets and capsules). However, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in entering into additional supplier agreements or that we will be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for any suppliers in a timely manner or at all.
 We attempt to prevent disruption of supplies through supply agreements, purchase orders, appropriate forecasting, maintaining stock levels and other strategies. In the event we are unable to manufacture our products, either directly or indirectly through others or on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, we may not be able to commercialize our products as planned. Although we are taking these actions to avoid a disruption in supply, we cannot provide assurance that we may not experience a disruption in the future.
 Marketing and Sales
 We commercialize Qsymia and PANCREAZE in the U.S. primarily through a specialty sales force, supported by an internal commercial team. Our efforts to expand the appropriate use of Qsymia include scientific publications, participation and presentations at medical conferences, and development and implementation of patient-directed support programs. We have rolled out marketing programs to encourage targeted prescribers to gain more experience with Qsymia. We have increased our investment in digital media in order to amplify our messaging to information-seeking consumers. The digital messaging encourages those consumers most likely to take action to speak with their physicians about obesity treatment options. We believe our enhanced web-based strategies will deliver clear and compelling communications to potential patients. We also provide the Q and Me® Patient Support Program online which supports Qsymia patients make the behavioral changes needed for sustained weight-loss. We launched PANCREAZE in the U.S. in February of 2019, which included 10 contract sales representatives and additional marketing and promotional activities.
 Product Distribution and REMS
 We rely on Cardinal Health 105, Inc. (“Cardinal Health”) a third‑party distribution and supply‑chain management company, to warehouse Qsymia and PANCREAZE and distribute them to the certified home delivery pharmacies and wholesalers that then distribute our products directly to patients and certified retail pharmacies. Cardinal Health provides billing, collection and returns services. Cardinal Health is our exclusive supplier of distribution logistics services, and accordingly we depend on Cardinal Health to satisfactorily perform its obligations under our agreement with them. We have also teamed with MedVantx Pharmacy Services to provide direct-to-patient distribution of Qsymia.
 Pursuant to the REMS program applicable to Qsymia, our distribution network is through a broader network of certified retail pharmacies and through a small number of certified home delivery pharmacies and wholesalers. We have contracted through a third‑party vendor to certify the retail pharmacies and collect required data to support the Qsymia REMS program. In addition to providing services to support the distribution and use of Qsymia, each of the certified pharmacies has agreed to comply with the REMS program requirements and, through our third‑party data collection vendor, will provide us with the necessary patient and prescribing HCP data. In addition, we have contracted with third‑party data warehouses to store this patient and HCP data and report it to us. We rely on this third‑party data in order to recognize revenue and comply with the REMS requirements for Qsymia, such as data analysis. This distribution and data collection network requires significant coordination with our sales and marketing, finance, regulatory and medical affairs teams, in light of the REMS requirements applicable to Qsymia.
 Competition
 Competition in the pharmaceutical and medical products industries is intense and is characterized by costly and extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. We are aware of several pharmaceutical companies also actively engaged in the development of therapies for the treatment of obesity, diabetes and sexual health and medical device companies engaged in the development of therapies for the treatment of sleep apnea. Many of these companies have substantially greater research and development capabilities as well as substantially greater marketing, financial and human resources than VIVUS. Our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we are currently marketing or researching and developing. Some of the drugs that may compete with Qsymia may not have a REMS requirement and the accompanying complexities such a requirement presents. Such developments could render Qsymia and STENDRA less competitive or possibly obsolete.

 Qsymia for the treatment of chronic weight management competes with several approved anti-obesity drugs including, Belviq® (lorcaserin), marketed by Eisai Inc., Eisai Co., Ltd.’s U.S. subsidiary; Xenical® (orlistat), marketed by Roche; alli®, the over-the-counter version of orlistat, marketed by GlaxoSmithKline; Contrave® (naltrexone/bupropion), Nalpropion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s anti-obesity compound; and Saxenda® (liraglutide), an anti-obesity compound marketed by Novo Nordisk A/S. 
 Agents approved for type 2 diabetes that have demonstrated weight loss in clinical studies may also compete with Qsymia. These include Farxiga™ (dapagliflozin) from AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb, an SGLT2 inhibitor; Jardiance® (empagliflozin) from Boehringer Ingelheim, an SGLT2 inhibitor; Victoza® (liraglutide) from Novo Nordisk A/S, a GLP-1 receptor agonist; Invokana® (canaglifozin) from Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals, an SGLT2 inhibitor and Glyxambi® (empagliflozin/linagliptin) from Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly, an SGLT2 inhibitor and DPP-4 inhibitor combination product. Also, EnteroMedics® Inc. markets the Maestro Rechargeable System for certain obese adults, the first weight loss treatment device that targets the nerve pathway between the brain and the stomach that controls feelings of hunger and fullness.
 In addition, there are several other investigational drug candidates in Phase 2 clinical trials. Zafgen’s beloranib, currently in Phase 2 for severe obesity, is a methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) inhibitor, which is believed to work by re establishing balance to the ways the body packages and metabolizes fat. In January 2013, Rhythm Pharmaceuticals (“Rhythm”) announced the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial with RM 493, a small peptide melanocortin 4 receptor (“MC4R”) agonist, for the treatment of obesity. Rhythm announced in September 2013, that RM 493 is being studied in Phase 1B for the treatment of obesity in individuals with a genetic deficiency in the MC4R pathway. There are a number of generic pharmaceutical drugs that are prescribed for obesity, predominantly phentermine, which is sold at much lower prices than we charge for Qsymia and is also widely available in retail pharmacies. The availability of branded prescription drugs, generic drugs and over the counter drugs could limit the demand and the price we are able to charge for Qsymia.
 We may also face competition from the off-label use of the generic components in our drugs. In particular, it is possible that patients will seek to acquire phentermine and topiramate, the generic components of Qsymia. Neither of these single-agent generic drugs has a REMS program. Although these products have not been approved by FDA for use in the treatment of chronic obesity, the off-label use of the generic drugs in the U.S. or the importation of the generic drugs from foreign markets could adversely affect the commercial potential for our drugs and adversely affect our overall business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Qsymia may also face challenges and competition from newly developed generic products. Under the U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, newly approved drugs and indications may benefit from a statutory period of non-patent marketing exclusivity. The Hatch-Waxman Act stimulates competition by providing incentives to generic pharmaceutical manufacturers to introduce non-infringing forms of patented pharmaceutical products and to challenge patents on branded pharmaceutical products. We received two notifications under paragraph IV of the Hatch-Waxman Act challenging certain of our Qsymia patents, and we filed suit against both challengers. In June 2017, we entered into a settlement agreement with Actavis Laboratories FL, Inc., Actavis, Inc., and Actavis PLC, collectively referred to as “Actavis,” and in August 2017, we entered into a settlement agreement with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, S.A. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc., collectively referred to as “DRL.” The settlement agreement with Actavis will permit Actavis to begin selling a generic version of Qsymia on December 1, 2024, or earlier under certain circumstances. The settlement agreement with DRL will permit DRL to begin selling a generic version of Qsymia on June 1, 2025, or earlier under certain circumstances. It is possible that one or more additional companies may file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) and could receive FDA approval to market a generic version of Qsymia before the entry dates specified in our settlement agreements with Actavis and DRL. If a generic version of Qsymia is launched, our business will be negatively impacted.
 There are also surgical approaches to treat severe obesity that are becoming increasingly accepted. Two of the most well established surgical procedures are gastric bypass surgery and adjustable gastric banding, or lap bands. In February 2011, FDA approved the use of a lap band in patients with a BMI of 30 (reduced from 35) with comorbidities. The lowering of the BMI requirement will make more obese patients eligible for these types of bariatric procedures. In addition, other potential approaches that utilize various implantable devices or surgical tools are in development. Some of these approaches are in late stage development and may be approved for marketing.

 PANCREAZE for the treatment of pancreatic insufficiency competes with Creon®, marketed by AbbVie, Inc., Zenpep®, marketed by Allergan Inc., Pertzye®, marketed by Digestive Care, Inc., and UltresaTM, marketed by Aptalis Phama US, Inc. 
 STENDRA for the treatment of ED competes with PDE5 inhibitors in the form of oral medications including Viagra® (sildenafil citrate), marketed by Pfizer, Inc.; Cialis® (tadalafil), marketed by Eli Lilly and Company; Levitra® (vardenafil), co-marketed by GlaxoSmithKline plc and Schering-Plough Corporation in the U.S.; and STAXYN® (vardenafil in an oral disintegrating tablet (“ODT”)), co-promoted by GlaxoSmithKline plc and Merck & Co., Inc. Additionally, generic formulations of sildenafil citrate and tadalafil are currently available on the market and, on January 3, 2017, we granted Hetero a license to manufacture and commercialize the generic version of STENDRA described in its ANDA filing in the United States as of the date that is the later of (a) October 29, 2024, which is 180 days prior to the expiration of the last to expire of the patents-in-suit, or (b) the date that Hetero obtains final approval from FDA of the Hetero ANDA.
 New developments, including the development of other drug technologies and methods of preventing the incidence of disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries at a rapid pace. These developments may render our drugs and future investigational drug candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. Compared to us, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater:

· | research and development resources, including personnel and technology;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | regulatory experience;
--+-----------------------


· | investigational drug candidate development and clinical trial experience;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | experience and expertise in exploitation of intellectual property rights; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | access to strategic partners and capital resources.
--+----------------------------------------------------

  As a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our investigational drug candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs or surgical approaches that are more effective, more useful and less costly than ours and may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products. In addition, our competitors may be more effective in commercializing their products. We currently outsource our manufacturing and therefore rely on third parties for that competitive expertise. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop or contract for these capabilities on acceptable economic terms, or at all.
 Avanafil qualifies as an innovative medicinal product in the EU. Innovative medicinal products authorized in the EU on the basis of a full marketing authorization application (as opposed to an application for marketing authorization that relies on data in the marketing authorization dossier for another, previously approved medicinal product) are entitled to eight years’ data exclusivity. During this period, applicants for approval of generics or biosimilars of these innovative products cannot rely on data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product. Innovative medicinal products are also entitled to 10 years’ market exclusivity. During this 10‑year period no generic or biosimilar medicinal product can be placed on the EU market. The 10‑year period of market exclusivity can be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the Marketing Authorization Holder for the innovative product obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. If we do not obtain extended patent protection and data exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.
 Employees
 As of February 20, 2019, we had 57 employees located at our corporate headquarters in Campbell, California and in the field. None of our current employees are represented by a labor union or are the subject of a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good, and we have never experienced a work stoppage at any of our facilities.

 Insurance
 We maintain product liability insurance for our clinical trials and commercial sales and general liability and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for our operations. Insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. Although we have obtained product liability insurance coverage, we may be unable to maintain this product liability coverage for our approved drugs in amounts or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against all potential risks.
