ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OUR COMPANY
Hertz Holdings was incorporated in Delaware in 2015 to serve as the top-level holding company for Rental Car Intermediate Holdings, LLC, which wholly owns Hertz, Hertz Global's primary operating company. Hertz was incorporated in Delaware in 1967 and is a successor to corporations that have been engaged in the vehicle rental and leasing business since 1918.
We are engaged principally in the business of renting vehicles primarily through our Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty brands, and we operate our vehicle rental business globally from approximately 11,400 corporate and franchisee locations in North America, Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, the Middle East and New Zealand. We remain one of the largest worldwide vehicle rental companies and our Hertz brand name is one of the most recognized globally. We have an extensive network of airport and off airport rental locations in the U.S. and in all major European markets. In addition to vehicle rental, we provided integrated vehicle leasing and fleet management solutions through our Donlen subsidiary, which sold substantially all of its assets and certain liabilities on March 30, 2021 (the "Donlen Sale"), as disclosed in Note 3, "Divestitures," to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included in this 2021 Annual Report.
COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, affecting multiple global regions. The impact of this pandemic has been extensive in many aspects of society, which has resulted in significant disruptions to the global economy, as well as businesses around the world. In an effort to halt the spread of COVID-19, many governments around the world placed significant restrictions on travel, individuals voluntarily reduced their air and other travel in attempts to avoid the outbreak, and many businesses announced closures and imposed travel restrictions. In 2021, individuals across the globe have increasingly gained access to COVID-19 vaccinations, particularly in the U.S. As a result, many of the government-imposed restrictions have been lifted or eased, and travel, particularly domestic leisure travel, has experienced a strong rebound. There remains continued uncertainty about the duration of the negative impact from COVID-19 and its variants, including the length and scope of travel restrictions and business closures that may be imposed by governments of impacted countries or voluntarily undertaken by individuals and private businesses.
Emergence from Bankruptcy
On May 22, 2020, the Debtors filed petitions under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. The Chapter 11 Cases were jointly administered by the Bankruptcy Court under the caption In re The Hertz Corporation, et al., Case No. 20-11218 (MFW).
On May 14, 2021, the Debtors filed the Plan of Reorganization, and the solicitation version of the Supplement to the Disclosure Statement which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on May 14, 2021. On June 10, 2021, the Plan of Reorganization was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. On June 30, 2021, the Plan of Reorganization became effective in accordance with its terms and the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11 (the "Chapter 11 Emergence"). For additional information about our restructured debt and new equity in connection with the Plan of Reorganization, see Note 6, "Debt," and Note 16, "Equity and Mezzanine Equity – Hertz Global," to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included in this 2021 Annual Report. Additional information about the Chapter 11 Cases, including access to documents filed with the Bankruptcy Court, is available online at https://restructuring.primeclerk.com/hertz, a website administered by Prime Clerk.

Our Strategy
Our strategy is focused on excellence in execution of our rental operations, electrification of the fleet, shared mobility, connected cars and exiting vehicles from the fleet directly to consumers. Our core assets and capabilities underpin this strategy and our partnerships with Tesla, Uber and Carvana are positioning us at the center of the modern mobility ecosystem. We will continue building on our brand strength and global fleet management expertise, combining it with new investments in technology, electrification, shared mobility and a digital-first customer experience. Our key fleet management capabilities will allow us to diversify and profitably grow in new areas of the mobility sector.
OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS
In the second quarter of 2021, in connection with our Chapter 11 Emergence and changes in how our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews operating results and allocates resources, we revised our reportable segments to include Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean in our Americas RAC reportable segment, which historically was our U.S. RAC reportable segment; these regions had previously been included in our International RAC reportable segment. Accordingly, all periods have been restated to conform with the revised presentation. The Company has identified two reportable segments, which are consistent with its operating segments, as follows:
•Americas RAC - Rental of vehicles as well as sales of value-added services, in the U.S., Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean. We maintain a substantial network of company-operated rental locations in this segment and we also have franchisees and partners that operate rental locations under our brands; and
•International RAC - Rental and leasing of vehicles as well as sales of value-added services in locations other than the U.S., Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean. We maintain a substantial network of company-operated rental locations, a majority of which are in Europe. Our franchisees and partners also operate rental locations in approximately 110 countries and jurisdictions, including many of the countries in which we also have company-operated rental locations.
Also, in the second quarter of 2021, as a result of the Donlen Sale, as further disclosed in Note 3, "Divestitures," to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included in this 2021 Annual Report, the All Other Operations reportable segment which was primarily comprised of the Donlen business was no longer deemed to be a reportable segment.
In addition to the above reportable segments, we have corporate operations. We assess performance and allocate resources based upon the financial information for our operating segments.
For further financial information on our segments, see (i) Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations and Selected Operating Data by Segment" and (ii) Note 19, "Segment Information," to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included in this 2021 Annual Report.

Americas RAC and International RAC Segments
Brands
Our Americas RAC and International RAC vehicle rental businesses are primarily operated through three brands — Hertz, Dollar, and Thrifty. We offer multiple brands in order to provide customers a full range of rental services at different price points, levels of service, offerings and products. Each of our brands generally maintains separate airport counters, reservations, marketing and other customer contact activities. We achieve synergies across our brands by, among other things, utilizing a single fleet and fleet management team and combined vehicle maintenance, vehicle cleaning and back office functions, where applicable.
Our top tier brand, Hertz, is one of the most recognized brands in the world offering premium services that define the industry. This is consistent with numerous published best-in-class vehicle rental awards that we historically have won both in the U.S. and internationally. We go to market under the tagline of “Hertz. Let's Go!” which represents our commitment to quality, seamless travel and customer service. We have a number of innovative offerings, such as Hertz Gold Plus Rewards, Hertz Ultimate Choice and unique vehicles offered through our EV fleet and specialty collections. We continue to maintain our position as a premier provider of vehicle rental services through an intense focus on service, loyalty, quality and product innovation.
Our smart value brand, Dollar, is the choice for financially-focused travelers looking for a dependable car at a price they can afford. The Dollar brand’s main focus is serving the airport vehicle rental market, comprised of family, leisure and small business travelers. Dollar’s tagline of “We never forget whose dollar it is” indicates the brand’s mission to provide a reliable rental experience at a price that works. Dollar operates primarily through company-owned locations in the U.S. and Canada.
Our deep value brand, Thrifty, is the brand for cost-conscious travelers to find a good deal. The Thrifty brand’s main focus is serving the airport vehicle rental market, comprised of leisure travelers. Thrifty’s tagline “The Absolute Best Car for Your Money” indicates the brand’s focus on being the rental company that puts you in control of where you splurge and where you save. Thrifty operates primarily through company-owned locations in the U.S. and Canada. 
In certain locations outside the U.S., we also offer our Firefly brand which is a deep value brand for price conscious leisure travelers. We have Firefly locations servicing local area airports in select non-U.S. leisure markets where other deep value brands have a significant presence.
Operations
Locations
We operate our brands at both airport and off airport locations which utilize common vehicle fleets, are supervised by common country, regional and local area management, use many common systems and rely on common vehicle maintenance and administrative centers. Additionally, our airport and off airport locations utilize common marketing activities and have many of the same customers. We regard both types of locations as aspects of a single, unitary, vehicle rental business. Off airport revenues comprised approximately 32% of our worldwide vehicle rental revenues in 2021 and approximately 46% in 2020. Our Americas RAC vehicle rental operations have company-operated locations primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Our International RAC vehicle rental operations have company-operated locations in Australia, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Slovakia, Spain and the United Kingdom.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued)

Airport
We have approximately 1,900 airport rental locations in our Americas RAC segment and approximately 1,400 airport rental locations in our International RAC segment. We believe that our extensive global network of locations contributes to the consistency of our service, cost control, Vehicle Utilization, competitive pricing and our ability to offer one-way rentals.
For our airport company-operated rental locations, we have obtained concessions or similar leasing agreements or arrangements, granting us the right to conduct a vehicle rental business at the respective airport. Our concessions were obtained from the airports' operators, which are typically governmental bodies or authorities, following either negotiation or bidding for the right to operate a vehicle rental business. The terms of an airport concession typically require us to pay the airport's operator concession fees based upon a specified percentage of the revenues we generate at the airport, subject to a minimum annual guarantee. Under most concessions, we must also pay fixed rent for terminal counters or other leased properties and facilities. Most concessions are for a fixed length of time, while others create operating rights and payment obligations that are terminable at any time. As a result of the impact from COVID-19 we received rent concessions in the form of abatement and payment deferrals of fixed and variable rent payments for certain of our airport locations. See Note 9, "Leases," to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements under the caption Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included in this 2021 Annual Report for further details.
The terms of our concessions typically do not forbid us from seeking, and in a few instances actually require us to seek, reimbursement from customers for concession fees we pay; however, in certain jurisdictions the law limits or forbids our doing so. Where we are required or permitted to seek such reimbursement, it is our general practice to do so. Certain of our concession agreements may require the consent of the airport's operator in connection with material changes in our ownership. A growing number of larger airports are building consolidated airport vehicle rental facilities to alleviate congestion at the airport. These consolidated rental facilities provide a more common customer experience and may eliminate certain competitive advantages among the brands as competitors operate out of one centralized facility for both customer rental and return operations, share consolidated busing operations and maintain image standards mandated by the airports.
Off Airport
We have approximately 3,500 off airport locations in our Americas RAC segment and approximately 4,600 off airport rental locations in our International RAC segment. Our off airport rental customers include people who prefer to rent vehicles closer to their home or place of work for business or leisure purposes, as well as those needing to travel to or from airports. Our off airport customers also include people who have been referred by, or whose rental costs are being wholly or partially reimbursed by, insurance companies following accidents in which their vehicles were damaged, those expecting to lease vehicles that are not yet available from their leasing companies and replacement renters. In addition, our off airport customers include drivers for our TNC Partners, which is further described in “TNC Rentals” below.
When compared to our airport rental locations, an off airport rental location typically uses smaller rental facilities with fewer employees, conducts pick-up and delivery services and serves replacement renters using specialized systems and processes. On average, off airport locations generate fewer transactions per period than airport locations.
Our off airport locations offer us the following benefits:
•Provide customers a more convenient and geographically extensive network of rental locations, thereby creating revenue opportunities from replacement renters, non-airline travel renters and airline travelers with local rental needs;
•Provide a more balanced revenue mix by reducing our reliance on air travel and therefore reducing our exposure to external events that may disrupt airline travel trends;
HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
THE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued)

•Contribute to higher Vehicle Utilization as a result of the longer average rental periods associated with off airport business, compared to those of airport rentals;
•Insurance replacement rental volume is less seasonal than that of other business and leisure rentals, which permits efficiencies in both vehicle and labor planning; and
•Cross-selling opportunities exist for us to promote off airport rentals among frequent airport Hertz Gold Plus Rewards program renters and, conversely, to promote airport rentals to off airport renters.
Customers and Business Mix
We conduct various sales and marketing programs to attract and retain customers. Our sales force calls on companies and other organizations whose employees and associates need to rent vehicles for business purposes or for replacement rental needs, including insurance and leasing companies, automobile repair companies and vehicle dealers. In addition, our sales force works with membership associations, tour operators, travel companies, TNC and other groups whose members, participants and customers rent vehicles for either business or leisure purposes. We advertise our vehicle rental offerings through a variety of traditional media channels, partner publications (e.g., affinity clubs and airline and hotel partners), direct mail and digital marketing. In addition to advertising, we conduct other forms of marketing and promotion, including travel industry business partnerships and press and public relations activities. As a result of cost-reduction initiatives, we have reduced the extent of our marketing and advertising activities over the last two years. See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations and Selected Operating Data by Segment" for further details.
We categorize our vehicle rental business based on the purpose and type of location from which customers rent from us. The following charts set forth the percentages of rental revenues and rental transactions in our Americas RAC and International RAC segments based on these categories.

Customers who rent from us for “business” purposes include those who require vehicles in connection with commercial activities, including drivers for our TNC Partners and delivery service providers, the activities of governments and other organizations or for temporary vehicle replacement purposes. Most business customers rent vehicles from us on terms that we have negotiated with their employers or other entities with which they are associated, and those terms can differ from the terms on which we rent vehicles to the general public. We have negotiated arrangements relating to vehicle rental with many businesses, governments and other organizations.
Customers who rent from us for “leisure” purposes include individual travelers booking vacation travel rentals with us and people renting to meet other personal needs. Leisure rentals are generally longer in duration and generate more revenue per transaction than business rentals. Leisure rentals also include rentals by customers of U.S. and international tour operators, which are usually a part of tour packages that can include air travel and hotel accommodations.

Demand for airport rentals is generally correlated with airline travel patterns, and transaction volumes generally follow global airline passenger traffic ("enplanement") and Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") trends. Customers often make reservations for airport rentals when they book their flight plans, which make our relationships with travel agents, associations and other partners (e.g., airlines and hotels) a key competitive strategy in generating consistent and recurring revenue streams. As discussed above, individuals across the globe have increasingly gained access to COVID-19 vaccinations resulting in many government-imposed travel restrictions being lifted or eased, and travel, particularly domestic leisure travel, has experienced a strong rebound. However, there remains continued uncertainty about the duration of the negative impact from COVID-19 and its variants, including the length and scope of travel restrictions and business closures that may be imposed by governments of impacted countries or voluntarily undertaken by individuals and private businesses.
Off airport rentals include insurance replacements, and we have agreements with the referring insurers establishing the relevant rental terms, including the arrangements made for billing and payment. We have identified approximately 200 insurance companies, ranging from local or regional vehicle carriers to large, national companies, as our target insurance replacement market. As of December 31, 2021, we were a preferred or recognized supplier for 62% of these insurance companies and a co-primary for 19% of them.
Customer Service Offerings
At our major airport rental locations and certain smaller airport and off airport locations, customers participating in our Hertz Gold Plus Rewards program are able to rent vehicles in an expedited manner. Participants in our Hertz Gold Plus Rewards program often bypass the rental counter entirely and proceed directly to their vehicle upon arrival at our facility. Participants in our Hertz Gold Plus Rewards program are also eligible to earn Hertz Gold Plus Rewards points that may be redeemed for free rental days or converted to awards of other companies' loyalty programs. Hertz's Gold Plus Rewards program offers three elite membership tiers which provide more frequent renters the opportunity to earn additional reward points and vehicle upgrades. For the year ended December 31, 2021, rentals by Hertz Gold Plus Rewards members accounted for approximately 30% of our worldwide rental transactions. We believe the Hertz Gold Plus Rewards program provides us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly among frequent travelers, and we have targeted such travelers for participation in the program. We offer electronic rental agreements and returns for our Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty customers in the U.S. Simplifying the rental transaction saves customers time and provides greater convenience through access to digitally available rental contracts.
When Hertz Gold Plus Rewards members make a reservation for a midsize car or above, they have access to exclusive vehicles based on their membership tier via our Hertz Ultimate Choice program which allows customers to 
HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
THE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued)

choose their vehicle from a range of makes, models and colors available within the zone indicated on their reservation. Alternatively, they may upgrade at pick-up for a fee by choosing a vehicle from the Premium Upgrade zone. The Hertz Ultimate Choice program is offered at 62 U.S. and Canada airport locations as of December 31, 2021.
TNC Rentals
We have partnered with certain companies in the TNC market in North America to offer vehicle rentals to their drivers in select cities. Using vehicles for TNC rentals results in an increased supply of higher mileage, and thus more economical, used vehicles for our vehicle disposition programs discussed below. Drivers for our TNC Partners reserve vehicles online through TNC Partner websites and pick up vehicles from select locations. TNC drivers can extend the vehicle rental on a weekly basis. In October 2021, we announced an exclusive partnership with Uber to make Teslas available for their drivers to rent on the Uber network in the U.S. We believe that this arrangement will improve driver-level economics relative to internal combustion vehicles.
Hertz 24/7
We offer a car and van-sharing membership service, referred to as Hertz 24/7, which rents vehicles by the hour and/or by the day, at various locations internationally, primarily in Europe. Members reserve vehicles online, then receive the vehicles at convenient locations using keyless entry, without the need to visit a Hertz rental office. Members are charged an hourly or daily vehicle-rental fee which includes fuel, insurance, 24/7 roadside assistance and in-vehicle customer service. Hertz 24/7 specializes in Business-to-Business-to-Consumer (B2B2C) services working with retail partners to provide vans at their locations and with corporations providing pool fleets for use by their employees.
Other Customer Service Offerings
We offer a Mobile Gold Alerts service, available to participating Hertz Gold Plus Rewards customers, through which a text message and/or email with the vehicle information and location is sent approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival, providing the option to choose another vehicle. We offer Hertz e-Return, which allows customers to drop off their vehicle and go without the need to visit the rental counter. Customers can also use cashless toll lanes with our PlatePass offering where the license plate acts as a transponder. We also offer a vehicle-subscription service on a monthly or weekend basis in select locations that provides a flexible, cost-effective alternative to vehicle ownership, with no long-term commitment required, referred to as Hertz My Car and My Hertz Weekend. As a result of COVID-19, we implemented enhanced safety measures to provide customers confidence while renting our vehicles. The Hertz Gold Standard Clean seal ensures that each vehicle is sealed prior to rental following a rigorous 15-point cleaning and sanitization process that follows U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.
Rates
We rent a wide variety of makes and models of vehicles. We rent vehicles on an hourly (in select international markets), daily, weekend, weekly, monthly or multi-month basis, with rental charges computed on a limited or unlimited mileage rate, or on a time rate plus a mileage charge. Our rates vary by brand and at different locations depending on local market conditions and other competitive and cost factors. While vehicles are usually returned to the locations from which they are rented, we also allow one-way rentals from and to certain locations. We also generate revenues from reimbursements by customers of airport concession fees, unless the law limits or forbids us from doing so, and vehicle licensing costs, fueling charges, and charges for value-added services such as supplemental equipment (e.g., child seats and ski racks), loss or collision damage waiver, theft protection, liability and personal accident/effects insurance coverage, premium emergency roadside service and satellite radio.
Reservations
We price and accept reservations for our vehicles through each of our brands. Reservations are generally for a class of vehicles, such as compact, midsize or sport utility vehicle.
HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
THE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued)

We distribute pricing and content and accept reservations through multiple channels. Direct reservations are accepted at Hertz.com, Dollar.com and Thrifty.com, which have global and local versions in multiple languages. Hertz.com offers a range of products, prices and additional services as well as Hertz Gold Plus Rewards benefits, serving both company-operated and franchise locations. In addition to our websites, direct reservations are enabled via our Hertz and Dollar smartphone apps, which include additional connected products and services.
Customers may also seek reservations via travel agents or third-party travel websites. In many of those cases, the travel agent or website utilizes an Application Programming Interface connection to Hertz or a third-party operated computerized reservation system, also known as a Global Distribution System, to contact us and make the reservation.
In our major markets, including the U.S. and all other countries with company-operated locations, customers may also reserve vehicles for rental from us and our franchisees worldwide through local, national or toll-free telephone calls to our reservations center, directly through our rental locations or, in the case of insurance replacement rentals, through proprietary automated systems serving the insurance industry.
Franchisees
In certain U.S. and international markets, we have found it efficient to issue licenses under franchise arrangements to independent franchisees who are engaged in the vehicle rental business. Franchisees rent vehicles that they own or lease to customers, primarily under our Hertz, Dollar or Thrifty brand. In certain markets and under certain circumstances, franchisees may acquire franchises for multiple brands.
Franchisees generally pay an initial license fee, royalties based on a percentage of their revenues as well as other fees, and in return are provided the use of the applicable brand name, certain operational support and training, reservations through our reservation channels, and other services. Additionally, franchisees may utilize our vehicles to support one-way business intra country. Franchisee arrangements enable us to offer expanded national and international service and a broader one-way rental program. In addition to vehicle rental, certain international franchisees engage in vehicle leasing, and the rental of chauffeur-driven vehicles, camper vans and motorcycles.
The transfer of a franchisee license is limited without our consent and such licenses are generally terminable by us only for cause or after a fixed term. Many of these agreements also include a company right of first refusal should a franchisee receive a bona fide offer to sell the license. Franchisees in the U.S. typically may terminate on prior notice, generally 180 days. In Europe and certain other international jurisdictions, franchisees typically do not have early termination rights. We continue to issue new licenses and, from time to time, re-acquire franchised businesses or sell corporate locations to franchisees.
Franchise operations, including fleet acquisition, are generally financed independently by the franchisees and we do not have an investment interest in the franchisees. Fees from franchisees, including initial franchise fees, generally support the cost of our brand awareness programs, reservations system, sales and marketing efforts and certain other services and are approximately 2% of our worldwide vehicle rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Seasonality
Our vehicle rental operations are historically a seasonal business, excluding the year ended December 31, 2020 which was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as discussed above, with decreased levels of business in the winter months and heightened activity during the spring and summer months ("our peak season") for the majority of countries where we generate our revenues. To accommodate increased demand, we typically increase our available fleet and staff, which is comprised of a significant number of part-time and seasonal workers, during the second and third quarters of the year. A number of our other major operating costs, including airport concession fees, commissions and vehicle liability expenses, are directly related to revenues or transaction volumes. Certain operating expenses, including real estate taxes, rent, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other facility-related 
HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
THE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued)

expenses, the costs of operating our information technology systems and minimum staffing costs, remain fixed and cannot be adjusted for seasonal demand.
The following chart sets forth this seasonal nature of our vehicle rental operations, as well as the impact of COVID-19, primarily in 2020, by presenting the proportionate contribution of each quarter to full year revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Fleet
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we operated a peak rental fleet in our Americas RAC and International RAC segments of approximately 389,300 vehicles and 78,400 vehicles, respectively. Purchases of vehicles are financed by active and ongoing global borrowing programs and through cash from operations. The vehicles purchased are either program vehicles or non-program vehicles. We periodically review the efficiencies of an optimal mix between program and non-program vehicles in our fleet and adjust the ratio of program and non-program vehicles as needed based on contract negotiations, vehicle economics and availability. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our approximate average holding period for a rental vehicle was 25 months in our Americas RAC segment and 20 months in our International RAC segment which are longer than historical holding periods as a result of supply chain constraints due to the Chip Shortage.
In October 2021, we announced our plan to significantly expand our EV rental fleet in North America, as discussed below in Corporate Responsibility—Fuel Efficient Fleet.
HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
THE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued)

Our fleet composition is as follows:
Fleet Composition by Vehicle Manufacturer*
As of December 31, 2021
Americas RAC                    International RAC*
* Vehicle manufacturers Daimler AG (Mercedes Benz and Smart), Renault, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Volvo and Rover Group together comprise another 12% of the International RAC fleet and are included as "Other" in the overall and International RAC charts above. 
We maintain vehicle maintenance centers which provide maintenance for our fleet, many of which include sophisticated vehicle diagnostic and repair equipment, and are accepted by automobile manufacturers, as eligible, to perform warranty work. Collision damage and major repairs are generally performed by independent contractors.
Repurchase Programs
Program vehicles are purchased under repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs with vehicle manufacturers wherein the manufacturers agree to repurchase vehicles at a specified price or guarantee the depreciation rate on the vehicles during established repurchase periods, subject to, among other things, certain vehicle condition, mileage and holding period requirements. Repurchase prices under repurchase programs are based on the original cost less a set daily depreciation amount. These repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs limit our residual risk with respect to vehicles purchased under the programs and allow us to reduce the variability of depreciation expense for each vehicle, however, typically the acquisition cost is higher. Program vehicles generally provide us with flexibility to increase or reduce the size of our fleet based on market demand. When we increase the percentage of program vehicles, the average age of our fleet decreases since the average 
HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
THE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued)

holding period for program vehicles is shorter than for non-program vehicles. During 2021, the number of program vehicles in our fleet decreased primarily due to the impact from the Chip Shortage on new vehicle production.
Program vehicles as a percentage of all vehicles purchased within our Americas RAC and International RAC segments during the last three fiscal years were as follows:
Hertz Car Sales, Rent2Buy and Other Vehicle Disposition Channels
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the vehicles sold in our U.S. and international vehicle rental operations that were not repurchased by manufacturers were sold through auction and dealer direct wholesale channels and retail channels.
In October 2021, we announced a nationwide agreement with Carvana with respect to our vehicle disposition process. With demand for used vehicles at an all-time high, we recognized the opportunity to streamline our vehicle disposition cycle, while at the same time filling a need in the used car market. The Carvana arrangement allows us to digitize and modernize our retail sales process while providing Carvana with a greater supply of used vehicles. This is intended to reduce our reliance on wholesale channels and allows us to renew our vehicle supply more rapidly, thereby strengthening our business.
Our retail sales channel, Hertz Car Sales, consists of a network of company-operated vehicle sales locations throughout the U.S. dedicated to the sale of vehicles from our rental fleet. Vehicles disposed of through our retail outlets provide for ancillary vehicle sales revenue, such as warranty, financing and title fees.
We also offer Rent2Buy in 26 states in the U.S., an innovative program in which customers are able to rent a vehicle from our rental fleet and if the customer purchases the vehicle, the customer is credited with a portion of their rental charges. The purchase transaction is completed through the internet and by mail in those states where permitted.
Markets and Competition
Competition among vehicle rental industry participants is intense and is primarily based on vehicle availability and quality, price, service, reliability, rental locations, product innovation and competition from online travel agents and vehicle rental brokers. We believe that the strength of the Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty brands, our extensive worldwide ownership of vehicle rental operations and our commitment to innovation, including our EV initiatives, provide us with a strong competitive advantage. Our principal vehicle rental industry competitors are Avis Budget Group, Inc., 
HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
THE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued)

which currently operates the Avis, Budget, ZipCar and Payless brands, and Enterprise Holdings, which operates the Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company, National Car Rental and Alamo Rent A Car brands. There are also local and regional vehicle rental companies, transportation network companies which provide ride-hailing services that have some overlap in customer use cases, largely with respect to short length trips in urban areas, and peer-to-peer car sharing marketplaces. 
U.S.
The U.S. represents approximately $28 billion in estimated annual industry revenues for 2021. The average number of vehicles in the U.S. vehicle rental industry in 2021 was about 2 million vehicles. U.S. industry Revenue Per Unit Per Month in 2021 was approximately $1,320.
Europe
Europe represents approximately $11 billion in estimated annual industry revenues for 2021. Europe has generally demonstrated a lower historical reliance on air travel because the European off airport vehicle rental market has been significantly more developed than it is in the U.S. Within Europe, the largest markets in which we do business are France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Throughout Europe, we do business through company-operated rental locations and through our partners or franchisees.
Asia Pacific
Asia Pacific represents approximately $14 billion in estimated annual industry revenues for 2021. Within this region, the largest markets in which we do business are Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. In each of these markets we do business through company-operated rental locations and through our partners or franchisees.
Middle East and Africa
The Middle East and Africa represent approximately $3 billion in estimated annual industry revenues for 2021. Within these regions, the largest markets in which we do business are Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates. In each of these markets we do business through our franchisees.
Latin America
Latin America represents approximately $3 billion in estimated annual industry revenues for 2021. Within Latin America, the largest markets in which we do business are Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Panama. In each of these markets our Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty brands are present through our partners or franchisees.
EMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 23,000 persons, consisting of approximately 17,000 persons in the U.S. and approximately 6,000 persons internationally, a decrease internationally of 14% from December 31, 2020 due primarily to a restructuring program affecting approximately 900 employees in our international operations, specifically in Europe.
Certain employees outside the U.S. are covered by a wide variety of union contracts and governmental regulations affecting, among other things, compensation, job retention rights and pensions. Labor contracts covering the terms of employment of approximately 27% of our workforce in the U.S. (including those in the U.S. territories) are presently in effect with local unions, affiliated primarily with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the International Association of Machinists. Labor contracts covering approximately 11% of these employees will expire during 2022. We have had no material work stoppage as a result of labor problems during the last ten years, and we believe our labor relations to be good. Nevertheless, we may be unable to negotiate new labor contracts on terms advantageous to us, or without labor interruption.

In addition to the employees referred to above, we engage outside services, as is customary in the industry, principally for the non-revenue movement of rental vehicles between rental locations.
Human Capital Management
We continue to evolve for our customers, employees, partners, franchisees and communities. With respect to our employees, our Board and Board committees periodically review of our employee programs and initiatives, providing oversight to how we should attract, retain and develop a workforce that aligns with our values and strategies, including through competitive compensation and benefits, learning and development opportunities and cultivating an engaged and inclusive culture. In addition, we conduct anonymous surveys, seeking feedback from our broad employee base on topics including, but not limited to, effectiveness of company communication, confidence in leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and total rewards packages and career growth and development opportunities. Survey results are reviewed by our senior management and shared with employees, along with action plans, for leveraging employee insights to drive meaningful improvements in our employees' experiences.
Our people are our greatest asset and we strive to have a constant focus and attention on matters concerning our employees including retention and professional development as well as employees’ physical, emotional and financial well-being. We are committed to an inclusive workplace around the globe that champions equality, values different backgrounds and celebrates individuality. We regularly assess our benefits and program offerings to provide a compelling and comprehensive portfolio, which currently includes:
•Competitive salaries and wages;
•Retirement savings with a 401(k) Plan and an employer match, up to a certain percentage;
•Comprehensive health insurance, including medical, dental and vision plans for employees and their dependents;
•Employer provided life insurance with no cost to employees;
•No-cost employee assistance program, providing confidential counseling to help employees and their families dealing with hardships;
•Paid parental leave;
•Free health screenings and programs for tobacco cessation, weight management and wellness coaching;
•Employee referral program;
•Employee and family rental car and car sales discounts;
•Employee tuition reimbursement program;
•Employee relief fund that provides immediate, short-term financial assistance to North America employees through employee contributions and company match to assist employees dealing with natural disasters;
•Training and development opportunities; and
•Employee resource groups.
We are committed to protecting the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners. Beginning in 2020, COVID-19 caused an unprecedented crisis for the travel and tourism industry, disrupting work practices, consumer behavior and long-term strategic plans. Despite these challenges, we have maintained our priority of supporting our people and our communities. We implemented heightened safety measures for employees and customers and introduced the Hertz Gold Standard Clean process, an enhanced 15-point cleaning process. We deployed protocols, signage and employee training to ensure compliance with COVID-19 Centers for Disease Control guidelines and local regulations. We equipped our employees with personal protective equipment as well as plexiglass guards, implemented enhanced facility and vehicle cleaning practices, mandated face-coverings and established processes for assessing possible COVID-19 exposures and responding to known or suspected COVID-19 cases. In addition, we partnered with LabCorp Employer Services to provide at-home COVID-19 test kits at no charge to employees. We are committed to seeking ways to best support our employees and customers and adapting our processes in response to changing guidelines as we continue to navigate through the COVID-19

pandemic. We also partnered with Rite Aid to provide educational and interactive COVID-19 vaccine webinars. In addition, we hosted multiple onsite COVID-19 vaccination clinics.
Outside of the U.S., we are committed to offering similar comprehensive programs that leverage the best of global benefits but also tailored by country to reflect local practices and culture. We evaluate our total benefits and programs annually and use feedback from employees to make thoughtful changes to ensure our programs continue to meet the needs of employees.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
We recognize our influence and are committed to do the right thing, the right way, every time – for our employees and customers, as well as our communities and our planet. Delivering on this responsibility is a never-ending journey – one that we're proud to be on. We are committed to managing our businesses ethically and responsibly as we believe doing so enables us to realize the continuous improvement, sustainable innovation and enhanced business performance that are critical to our success.
Our People and Communities
At the heart of Hertz Global is our people. Our employees help drive our progress, innovation and success. We strive to empower our employees so they can build trust with our customers and the communities we serve around the world. As discussed above in Human Capital Management, attracting and retaining top talent is more than a measure of our business success; it is a measure of who we are and what we value. In addition, we engage with our communities, and, through our global charitable giving and volunteer program, we are committed to making a positive difference in the areas where we work, live and serve.
Diversity
We are committed to championing and preserving a culture of diversity and inclusion. We believe the varied perspectives, experiences, skills and talents of our employees represent a significant part of our culture – as well as our success and reputation as a company.
As a global business, we have a firm commitment to equal opportunity, non-discrimination and anti-harassment. In addition, we adhere to all relevant laws and mandatory reporting requirements. We are proud to have a diverse workforce reflective of our customers, suppliers, communities and investors around the world, and are committed to a journey that gives growth and opportunities throughout our organization. We embrace and encourage our employees' differences in age, race, religion, disability, ethnicity, sexual orientation and other characteristics that make our employees unique.
At every level, we are committed to developing policies, practices and ways of working that support diversity and inclusion, and aim to create a workplace where everyone feels respected and heard.
Communities

The Environment
We are committed to reducing the impact our operations have on the environment and the communities we operate in through sustainable business practices, strategic decision-making, community partnerships and smart investments in future technologies, and in 2021, announced our plans to position us to be a leader in the future mobility ecosystem.
Climate Performance
We recognize the importance of reducing our greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions as both a climate and business imperative. We recently committed to setting GHG emissions reduction goals through the Science Based Target initiative (“SBTi”). We are committed to being at the center of the modern mobility ecosystem and believe our planned investments in EVs and charging infrastructure will enhance the sustainability of our operations.
Fuel Efficient Fleet
In 2021, we made a commitment to position ourselves at the center of modern mobility and entered into new and expanded relationships around EV and technology. We are also investing in new EV infrastructure across our global operations by installing a combination of Level 2 and Level 3 DC fast chargers throughout our network. As discussed in TNC Rentals above, we also entered into a partnership with Uber to provide EVs to drivers using the Uber network that can further accelerate the adoption of EVs.
We also partner with our corporate customers to create personalized travel programs aimed at reducing carbon emissions and fuel costs associated with their vehicle rentals, including access to a program through a leading third-party administrator for purchase of related carbon offsets. Additionally, we offer customization to help our corporate customers reduce fuel costs and expand their employees’ use of low- and zero-emission vehicles. 
We also are the exclusive rental car member of the Corporate Electric Vehicle Alliance, a consortium of companies focused on accelerating the transition to EVs.
Waste Reduction and Recycling
We work to integrate environmental sustainability across our operations, from our car washes to the way we build our rental locations. Resource conservation and waste reduction is at the forefront of that integration. We are committed to waste reduction across our global footprint. Recycling efforts include, but are not limited to, recycling used oils and solvents, tires, batteries, information technology equipment and general mixed materials.
Facilities and Construction
We seek to maximize energy and water efficiency at our facilities and rely on renewable energy at an increasing number of locations. We incorporate sustainable design and construction practices based on Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ("LEED") standards. LEED is administered by the U.S. Green Building Council and is the most widely used and respected green building rating system. Our world headquarters in Estero, Florida is LEED Gold® certified, and we have six additional rental locations in Estero, St. Louis, Charlotte, Denver, Dulles and Newark airports that are LEED certified. In addition to LEED, ISO 14001 sets environmental management standards and certifies facilities to those standards. Our Hertz European Service Center ("HESC") in Dublin, Ireland and our Heathrow International Airport location have achieved and maintain ISO 14001 certifications. HESC also holds and maintains ISO 45001 certification demonstrating the facility meets criteria to improve employee safety and reduce workplace risks. Both LEED and ISO standards enhance the health and comfort of building occupants, improve overall building performance and deliver cost savings.

In addition to incorporating leading standards into our buildings, we also strive to include on-site renewables consisting of solar photovoltaic systems at seven locations, which decreases our carbon footprint while lowering utility costs.
Our Business
Governance
We are committed to ensuring appropriate oversight and accountability of Corporate Responsibility. Our Corporate Responsibility Executive Steering Council (the "Council") is responsible for establishing environmental, social and governance ("ESG") key performance indicators and their integration into our business which is expected to commence in 2022. The Council reports to the Board's Governance Committee and its subcommittees and working groups set and implement policies and projects that move the needle on company-wide ESG goals.
Ethics
We are committed to operating in compliance with all applicable laws and maintaining the highest standards of ethical conduct. Our expectations may be high, but they are clear. Integrity is essential to every aspect of our business, both in policy and practice. Our Standards of Business Conduct informs when we should ask for further direction to support a policy or procedure and provides information, guidance and references covering a range of topics.
Supplier Diversity
We recognize that supporting diversity goes beyond our internal policies and practices, and we seek to build sustainable relationships with suppliers who integrate diversity into their own hiring processes and supply chain. Through our Supplier Diversity Program, we are committed to the equal and fair treatment of all suppliers. We aim to provide minority-owned, woman-owned and other socially or economically disadvantaged small businesses who perform at high levels the opportunity to compete to deliver products and services that support our brands.
As a long-standing member of the National Minority Supplier Development Council, the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council and the Airport Minority Advisory Council, we actively seek to do business with suppliers who are certified by such councils that recognize women and minorities.
Through these efforts, we seek to emphasize and ensure a supplier representation that fully reflects the customers and communities we serve. We believe that leveraging the global diversity of our workforce and supplier relations will enable us to address the local needs of the communities in which we live and work around the world
Data Protection
Hertz is committed to operating in compliance with all applicable privacy and data security laws. We have standards and policies in place to ensure the proper handling, use and storage of customer and employee information, including privacy protection, maintenance of data integrity and security. In addition, our employees participate in mandatory training and ongoing engagement that ensures our entire team is on the same page regarding compliance with our policies and practices.
INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT
There are three types of generally insurable risks that arise in our operations:
•legal liability arising from the operation of our vehicles (i.e., vehicle liability);
•legal liability to members of the public and employees from other causes (i.e., general liability/workers' compensation); and
HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
THE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued)

•risk of property damage and/or business interruption and/or increased cost of operating as a consequence of property damage.
In addition, we offer optional liability insurance and other products providing insurance coverage, which create additional risk exposures for us. Our risk of property damage is also increased when we waive the provisions in our rental contracts that hold a renter responsible for damage or loss under an optional loss or damage waiver that we offer. We bear these and other risks, except to the extent the risks are transferred through insurance or contractual arrangements.
In many cases we self-insure our risks or insure risks through wholly-owned insurance subsidiaries. We mitigate our exposure to large liability losses by maintaining excess insurance coverage, subject to deductibles and caps, through unaffiliated carriers. For our international operations outside of Europe and for our long-term vehicle leasing operations, we maintain some liability insurance coverage with unaffiliated carriers.
Third-Party Liability
In our U.S. operations, we are required by applicable financial responsibility laws to maintain insurance against legal liability for bodily injury, death or property damage to third parties arising from the operation of our vehicles, sometimes called “vehicle liability,” in stipulated amounts. In most jurisdictions, we satisfy those requirements by qualifying as a self-insurer, a process that typically involves governmental filings and demonstration of financial responsibility, which sometimes requires the posting of a bond or other security. In the remaining jurisdictions, we obtain an insurance policy from an unaffiliated insurance carrier and indemnify the carrier for any amounts paid under the policy. The regulatory method for protecting against such vehicle liability should be considered in the context of the Graves Amendment, as we generally bear limited economic responsibility for U.S. vehicle liability attributable to the negligence of our drivers, except to the extent that we successfully transfer such liability to others through insurance or contractual arrangements.
For our vehicle rental operations in Europe, we have established a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Probus Insurance Company Europe DAC (“Probus”), a direct writer of insurance domiciled in Ireland. In certain European countries with company-operated locations, we have purchased from Probus the vehicle liability insurance required by law. In other European countries, this coverage is purchased from unaffiliated carriers. Accordingly, as with our U.S. operations, we bear economic responsibility for vehicle liability in our European vehicle rental operations, except to the extent that we transfer such liability to others through insurance or contractual arrangements. For our international operations outside of Europe, we maintain some form of vehicle liability insurance coverage with unaffiliated carriers. The nature of such coverage and our economic responsibility for covered losses varies considerably. Nonetheless, we believe the amounts and nature of the coverage we obtain is adequate in light of the respective potential hazards.
In our U.S. and international operations, from time to time in the course of our business, we become legally responsible to members of the public for bodily injury, death or property damage arising from causes other than the operation of our vehicles, sometimes known as “general liability.” As with vehicle liability, we bear economic responsibility for general liability losses, except to the extent we transfer such losses to others through insurance or contractual arrangements. In addition, to mitigate these exposures, we maintain excess liability insurance coverage with unaffiliated insurance carriers.
In our U.S. vehicle rental operations, we offer an optional liability insurance product, Liability Insurance Supplement (“LIS”), that provides vehicle liability insurance coverage substantially higher than state minimum levels to the renter and other authorized operators of a rented vehicle. LIS coverage is primarily provided under excess liability insurance policies issued by an unaffiliated insurance carrier, the risks under which are reinsured with a wholly-owned subsidiary, HIRE Bermuda Limited.
In our U.S. vehicle rental operations and our company-operated international vehicle rental operations in many countries, we offer optional products providing Personal Accident Insurance / Personal Effects Coverage (“PAI/PEC”) and Emergency Sickness Protection ("ESP") insurance coverage to the renter and the renter's immediate 
HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
THE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued)

family members traveling with the renter for accidental death or accidental medical expenses arising during the rental period or for damage or loss of their property during the rental period. PAI/PEC and ESP coverages are provided under insurance policies issued by unaffiliated carriers or, in Europe, by Probus.
Our offering of LIS, PAI/PEC and ESP coverage in our U.S. vehicle rental operations is conducted pursuant to limited licenses or exemptions under state laws governing the licensing of insurance producers.
Provisions on our books for self-insured public liability and property damage vehicle liability losses are made by charges to expense based upon evaluations of estimated ultimate liabilities on reported and unreported claims.
Damage to Our Property
We bear the risk of damage to our property, unless such risk is transferred through insurance or contractual arrangements.
To mitigate our risk of large, single-site property damage losses globally, we maintain property insurance with unaffiliated insurance carriers in such amounts as we deem adequate in light of the respective hazards, where such insurance is available on commercially reasonable terms.
Our rental contracts typically provide that the renter is responsible for damage to or loss (including loss through theft) of rented vehicles. We generally offer an optional rental product, known in various countries as “loss damage waiver,” “collision damage waiver” or “theft protection,” under which we waive or limit our right to make a claim for such damage or loss.
Collision damage costs and the costs of stolen or unaccounted-for vehicles, along with other damage to our property, are charged to expense as incurred, net of reimbursements.
Other Risks
To manage other risks associated with our businesses, or to comply with applicable law, we purchase other types of insurance carried by business organizations, such as worker's compensation and employer's liability, commercial crime and fidelity, performance bonds, directors' and officers' liability insurance, terrorism insurance and cyber security insurance from unaffiliated insurance companies in amounts deemed by us to be adequate in light of the respective hazards, where such coverage is obtainable on commercially reasonable terms.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
We are subject to numerous types of governmental controls, including those relating to prices and advertising, privacy and data protection, currency controls, labor matters, credit and charge card operations, insurance, environmental protection, used vehicle sales and licensing.
Dealings with Renters
In the U.S., vehicle rental transactions are generally subject to Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code, which governs leases of tangible personal property. Vehicle rental is also specifically regulated in more than half of the states of the U.S. and many other international jurisdictions. The subjects of these regulations include the methods by which we advertise, the methods used to quote and charge prices, the consequences of failing to honor reservations, the terms on which we deal with vehicle loss or damage (including the protections we provide to renters purchasing loss or damage waivers) and the terms and method of sale of the optional insurance coverage that we offer. Some states (including California, Nevada and New York) regulate the price at which we may sell loss or damage waivers, and many state insurance regulators have authority over the prices and terms of the optional insurance coverage we offer. See “Insurance and Risk Management—Damage to Our Property” above for further discussion regarding the loss or damage waivers and optional insurance coverages that we offer renters. In addition, various consumer protection laws and regulations may generally apply to our business operations. 
HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
THE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued)

Internationally, regulatory regimes vary greatly by jurisdiction and include increasing scrutiny from consumer law regulators in Europe and a stronger focus on corporate compliance, but the regimes do not generally prevent us from dealing with customers in a manner similar to that employed in the U.S.
Both in the U.S. and internationally, we are subject to increasing regulation relating to customer privacy and data protection. In general, we are required to disclose our data collection and processing practices as well as our use and sharing of data that we collect from or about renters. In doing so, we are obligated to take reasonable steps to protect customer data while it is in our possession and comply with individual privacy right requests. Our failure to do so could subject us to substantial legal liability, require us to bear significant remediation costs or seriously damage our reputation.
Changes in Regulation
Changes in government regulation of our businesses have the potential to materially alter our business practices or our profitability. Depending on the jurisdiction, those changes may come about through new legislation, the issuance of new laws and regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and treaties by a court, regulatory body or governmental official. Those changes may have prospective and/or retroactive effect, particularly when a change is made through reinterpretation of laws or regulations that have been in effect for some time. Moreover, changes in regulation that may seem neutral on their face may have a more significant effect on us than on our competitors, depending on the circumstances. Several U.S. states historically required “bundled pricing” by rental vehicle companies but those same states subsequently enacted statutory exceptions to allow for the separate pass-through of certain fees (e.g., airport concession fees, customer facility charges and vehicle licensing fees) with proper disclosure. In addition, the Canadian Competition Bureau has interpreted Canadian consumer law to prohibit “drip pricing” such that base rate advertising is not allowed and the first price that consumers view on the websites of rental vehicle companies must reflect the bundled price for the proposed rental. Recent or potential changes in law or regulation that affect us relate to insurance intermediaries, customer privacy, like-kind exchange programs, data security and rate regulation and our retail vehicle sales operations.
In addition, our operations, as well as those of our competitors, could also be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations. We are not aware of any current proposal to impose such a regime in the U.S. or internationally. Such a regime could, however, be quickly imposed if there was a serious disruption in supply for any reason, including an act of war, terrorist incident or other problem affecting petroleum supply, refining, distribution or pricing.
Environmental
We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign environmental and safety laws, regulations, directives, rules and ordinances concerning, among other things, the operation and maintenance of vehicles; the ownership and operation of tanks for the storage of petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel fuel and oil; and the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of waste materials, including oil, vehicle wash sludge and waste water.
When applicable, we estimate and accrue for certain environmental costs, such as to study potential environmental conditions at sites deemed to require investigation or clean-up activities and for costs to implement remediation actions, including ongoing maintenance, as required. Based on information currently available, we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition. However, it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remedial actions and thus future costs associated with such matters may exceed the amount of the estimated accrued amount.
