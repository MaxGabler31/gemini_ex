ITEM 1. OUR BUSINESS

Air Group operates three airlines, Alaska, Virgin America and Horizon. McGee Air Services, an aviation services provider, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska. Together with regional partner airlines, we fly to 118 destinations with 1,200 daily departures through an expansive network across the United States, Mexico, Canada, and Costa Rica. With global airline partners, we provide our guests with a network of more than 900 destinations worldwide. During 2017, we carried an all-time high 44 million guests and earned consolidated net income of $1.0 billion, which represents a 27% increase over net income of $814 million in 2016. Our adjusted net income was $823 million, which excludes special items and merger-related costs of $118 million, and a $280 million benefit from new tax laws enacted in 2017. 
Our mission is "creating an airline people love." The "ing" is to recognize that we are never done; we are continually working to improve. We believe our success depends on our ability to provide safe air transportation, develop relationships with guests by providing exceptional customer service and low fares, and maintain a low cost structure to compete effectively. It is important to us that we achieve our objective as a socially responsible company that values not just performance, but people, the communities we serve, and environment. 
In 2017 we focused much of our energy on integrating Virgin America. We achieved several milestones, including merging most back office functions, kicking off station co-locations and launching technology that enables our front-line employees to be agile between Alaska and Virgin America applications. In January 2018, Alaska and Virgin America obtained a single operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), our most significant integration milestone to date. These accomplishments will ease our transition to a single Passenger Service System (PSS) in the Spring of 2018, which will help us unlock many of the revenue synergies expected from the acquisition. We remain on track to complete all of our integration milestones on schedule, and continue to be optimistic about the value of our combined company. 
With the integration well underway, we remain committed to our strategic focus to become the go-to airline for people on the West Coast. The acquisition of Virgin America positioned us as the fifth largest airline in the U.S., with an unparalleled ability to serve West Coast travelers. To do so, we believe we need to meet our guest's evolving needs through innovation in our onboard offerings and provide unique destinations with better schedules, while retaining the best of both the Alaska and Virgin America brand experiences. We have begun to implement this strategy in a number of ways, including merging our loyalty programs, allowing us to bring the award winning benefits of our Mileage Plan™ program to Virgin America's loyal customer base; rolling out Free Movies and Free Chat to Virgin America's entire fleet; and kicking off the first of several cabin enhancements of Alaska's Boeing aircraft with expressive mood lighting. 
While aircraft and technology enable us to provide air transportation, we recognize this is fundamentally a people business. Our employees maintain and strengthen our relationships with guests, and our success depends on our employees working together to successfully execute our strategy. In 2017, Alaska was once again named one of America's Best Employers by Forbes Magazine for the third year in a row. We know that engaged employees provide excellent service. In that vein, in 2017, Alaska ranked highest in J.D. Power and Associates annual survey of customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers for the tenth year in a row. Virgin America was also recognized for excellent service by Conde Nast Traveler and Travel + Leisure magazine also for the tenth year in a row. Customer service matters, and we believe the combination of Alaska and Virgin America will only enhance the experience for our guests. 
Operationally, Alaska held the No. 1 spot in the Wall Street Journal's "Middle Seat" scorecard for U.S. airlines for four consecutive years and the No. 2 spot for 2017. Although we were not the leader in on-time performance in 2017, we led the industry for on-time performance among major airlines for the previous seven years. We are focused on becoming the industry leader in operational performance once again as we fully integrate Alaska and Virgin America operations and we are off to a great start in 2018. For achieving safety, customer service, operational and financial goals, we rewarded our employees with $135 million for their service in 2017.
In support of the communities that we serve, we strive to be an industry leader in environmental and community stewardship. Our combined fleet is one of the youngest, most fuel-efficient fleets in North America and we look forward to further enhancements in this area. As a result of our environmental and corporate sustainability leadership, we ranked higher than any other North American airline in this year's Dow Jones Sustainability Index. We are also proud of our community stewardship - Air Group donated $14 million to over 1,300 charitable organizations, and our employees volunteered more than 32,000 hours of community service, focused on youth and education, medical research, and transportation and community outreach in 2017.

One of our leadership principles is to "give back" and we are proud of the efforts and voluntarism of our employees across the system. 
We continued to generate strong profits in 2017, marking our 14th consecutive annual profit on an adjusted basis. Our liquidity and capital position remain strong, positioning us among those of high-quality industrial companies. Due to our strong financial health and outlook, we are one of only three U.S. airlines with investment grade credit ratings. With the cash generated by our continued success, we have been able to invest in our business to achieve profitable growth and to enhance the guest experience. 
As we look to the future, we will build on our success by executing our strategic plan in the following areas: 
Be Safe and On time
We have an unwavering commitment to run a safe operation, and we will not compromise this commitment in the pursuit of other initiatives. Alaska and Horizon were the first U.S. major airlines to receive FAA validation and acceptance of our Safety Management System (SMS) in 2016. In 2017, Virgin America adopted SMS, ensuring a consistent safety process across our carriers. Additionally, all Virgin America employees received training for the Alaska Air Group SMS, our "Ready, Safe, Go" principles, and our mobile safety reporting system. Once again, in 2017, 100% of our Alaska and Horizon aircraft technicians completed the requirements for the FAA's "Diamond Certificate of Excellence" award. This is the 16th consecutive year Alaska Airlines has received the award and the 16th time in the last 18 years Horizon has received this award. We also believe that maintaining safe operations, through adherence to well-defined processes, and ensuring every Air Group employee is aware of their individual contribution to our operation, is critical to ensuring on-time performance. The rigor we apply to running a safe operation has resulted in Alaska consistently being one of the top airlines in North America for on-time performance.
Focus on People
Our business is fundamentally a people business, and our success depends on our nearly 23,000 employees. Engaged employees deliver higher productivity, superior execution and better customer service. In merging Alaska Airlines and Virgin America employees and labor groups, we kept a vigilant focus on creating an unbeatable culture. In January 2017, we rolled out "Momentum" training for all Virgin America employees to help bridge the two airlines and blend our cultures. We implemented Culture Champion initiatives to help employees build relationships across airlines, allowing them to share concerns and feedback directly with executive leadership. Similarly, our "QX Factor" program brought new energy to the Horizon employee experience. Our people programs and integration plan are focused on ensuring employees feel valued, informed and engaged in meaningful ways as we build our future. 
Aligning our employees' goals with Air Group's goals is important in achieving success. All permanent employees of our airlines participate in our Performance-Based Pay (PBP) and Operational Performance Rewards (OPR) programs, which encourage employees to work together to achieve metrics related to safety, profitability, on-time performance, low costs, customer loyalty, and customer satisfaction. Over the last five years, our incentive programs have paid out on average more than one month's pay, for most employees. 
Build a deep emotional connection for our brand
To be the go-to airline for people on the West Coast, we must be recognized for creating an airline that people love. In 2017, we built upon the strong brand connection we have with our guests in our Pacific Northwest markets and the state of Alaska by broadening our focus to include California. We rolled out fresh, modern marketing campaigns showcasing benefits such as our network growth, low fares, our Buy One Get One companion fare credit card promotional offer, and unique onboard experience elements. We are enthusiastic about our plans for continued investment in key products that will provide meaningful improvements to our guests, such as Gogo satellite internet which we will begin installing in early 2018. Additionally, we partnered with key sponsors in the Bay Area, including sports franchises such as the San Francisco Giants and the San Jose Sharks, as well as noted professional athletes including Kevin Durant of the Golden State Warriors. 
We continue to invest in key products that will provide meaningful improvements to our guests and further drive an emotional connection to our brand. This includes Free Chat and Free Movies and the launch of Gogo satellite service, already mentioned above. We’ve rolled out new digital products to improve the guest experience, including a new inflight entertainment portal and the beta launch of First Class meal pre-select. We’ve nearly completed retrofits of our Boeing fleet to include Premium Class, while adding larger overhead bins to many of our aircraft. Expanding our airport lounge portfolio, we’ve opened a third lounge at Sea-Tac airport and plan to open a lounge at JFK in 2018. Finally, guests can also look forward to an integrated onboard food and beverage program in 2018, which will emphasize fresh and local West Coast products on our aircraft.

Defend and grow our customer base
Competition in our markets is fierce and we know we must defend our customer base as we grow our network presence, by providing our guests with an increased choice of schedule times and fares, and allowing us to effectively compete for new guests. We will continue to introduce guests to our award-winning service, Mileage Plan™ program, and Visa signature credit card as we grow our network. We work hard to ensure our guests have a great experience on our airlines and provide an exceptional product at a low fare.
Win with low costs and low fares
We believe that our low-fare model gives us a competitive advantage by providing value to, and building trust with our guests. We also know that, in order to provide low fares in our growing network, while returning value to our shareholders, it is imperative for us to maintain a competitive cost structure. In 2017, our unit costs, excluding fuel and special items, remained flat year over year on a consolidated basis. We understand the importance of low costs to the business model and the success of the company and we have a long track record of reducing unit costs. Although our unit costs are expected to rise in 2018 primarily due to pilot wages and maintenance costs, we continue to focus on productivity, cost management, low overhead and leveraging capacity growth. We also manage increasing fuel costs by flying larger, more fuel-efficient aircraft, which have increased our fuel efficiency as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon by 3.5% over the last five years. As we continue to integrate Virgin America into our operations, we are committed to achieving our stated cost and revenue synergy goals. It is critical that we achieve these goals in order to continue our cost reduction efforts. 
During fiscal 2017, we added 44 new markets to the combined network. For 2018, we plan to grow our system-wide capacity approximately 7.5% as compared to 2017. Approximately 70% of growth in 2018 is attributable to existing routes and locations, with the rest attributable to our plans to fly 13 daily departures from Paine Field-Snohomish County Airport in Everett, Washington to eight West Coast markets starting in fall 2018.
AIR GROUP
Alaska Air Group is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 and the holding company of Alaska, Virgin America, Horizon, McGee Air Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska, and other business units. Alaska, Virgin America and Horizon operate as airlines however, the business plans, competition and economic risks differ substantially for Horizon in comparison to Alaska and Virgin America. McGee Air Services operates as an aviation services provider, focused on providing ground and ramp handling services to airlines. Alaska Airlines is an Alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937. Virgin America is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 2004 and acquired by Air Group on December 14, 2016. Horizon is a Washington corporation that began service and was incorporated in 1981. It was acquired by Air Group in 1986. McGee Air Services is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 2016. Alaska and Virgin America operate fleets of narrowbody passenger jets. Together, the operations of Alaska and Virgin America are referred to as "mainline" operations. Alaska also contracts with Horizon, SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest) and Peninsula Airways, Inc. (PenAir) for regional capacity such that Alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights. Horizon began operating E175 regional jet aircraft in 2017 in addition to its fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to Alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase agreement (CPA). The majority of our revenues are generated by transporting passengers. The percentage of revenues by category is as follows:

 | 2017 | | 2016(a) | | 2015 | 2014 | | 2013
Mainline passenger revenue | 74 | % | | 69 | % | 70 | % | | 70 | % | 70 | %

We offer extensive passenger service from the western U.S. throughout the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Mexico, and Costa Rica. Our largest concentration of departures are in Seattle, Portland, and the Bay Area. We also offer cargo service throughout our network and have dedicated cargo aircraft that operate primarily to and within the state of Alaska. 

In 2017, we carried 35 million revenue passengers in our mainline operations. At December 31, 2017, our mainline operating fleet consisted of 154 B737 jet aircraft and 67 Airbus A320 family jet aircraft compared to 155 B737 aircraft and 63 Airbus aircraft as of December 31, 2016.

FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM 
In 2017, we maintained two frequent flyer plans: the Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan™ and Virgin America Elevate®. To provide consistency and clarity to our guests, we merged the two programs throughout the year, and Elevate® was officially sunset in December 2017. 
Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan™ provides a comprehensive suite of frequent flyer benefits. Miles can be earned by flying on our airlines or on one of our 18 airline partners, by using the Alaska Airlines credit card, or through other non-airline partners. Alaska's extensive list of airline partners includes carriers associated with each of the three major global alliances, making it easier for our members to earn miles and reach elite status in our frequent flyer program. Through Alaska and our global partners, Mileage Plan™ members have access to a large network of over 900 worldwide travel destinations. Further, members can receive 30,000 bonus miles upon signing up for the Alaska Airlines Visa Signature card and meeting a minimum spend threshold, and earn triple miles on Alaska Airlines and Virgin America purchases. Alaska Airlines Visa Signature cardholders and small business cardholders in the U.S., and Platinum and World Elite Mastercard holders in Canada, also receive an annual companion ticket that allows members to purchase an additional ticket for $99 plus taxes, with no restrictions or black-out dates, and a free first checked bag for up to seven people traveling in the same itinerary. Earned miles can be redeemed for flights on our airlines, or partner airlines, or for upgrades to First Class on Alaska Airlines. We believe all of these benefits give our Mileage Plan™ members more value for their travel.
Mileage Plan™ and Elevate® revenues represented approximately 11% of Air Group's total revenues in 2017. Mileage Plan™ helps drive revenue growth by attracting new customers and building customer loyalty through the benefits that we provide. 
AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER AIRLINES
Our agreements fall into three different categories: Frequent Flyer, Codeshare and Interline agreements. Frequent Flyer agreements offer mileage credits and redemptions for our Mileage Plan™ members. Alaska offers one of the most comprehensive frequent flyer programs for our Mileage Plan™ members through frequent flyer partnerships with 18 domestic and international carriers. 
Codeshare agreements allow one or more marketing carriers to sell seats on a single operating carrier that services passengers under multiple flight numbers. The sale of codeshare seats can vary depending on the sale arrangement. For example, in a free-sale arrangement, the marketing carrier sells the operating carrier's inventory without any restriction; whereas in a block space arrangement, a fixed amount of seats are sold to the marketing carrier by the operating carrier. The interchangeability of the flight code between carriers provides a greater selection of flights for customers, along with increased flexibility for mileage accrual and redemption. 
Interline agreements allow airlines to jointly offer a competitive, single-fare itinerary to customers traveling via multiple carriers to a final destination. An interline itinerary offered by one airline may not necessarily be offered by the other, and the fares collected from passengers are prorated and distributed to interline partners according to preexisting agreements between the carriers. Frequent flyer, codeshare and interline agreements help increase our traffic and revenue by providing more route choices to our guests. 
Alaska has marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide frequent flyer and codesharing opportunities. Alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by:
 8



• | offering our guests more travel destinations and better mileage credit/redemption opportunities, including elite qualifying miles on U.S. and international airline partners;


• | giving our frequent flyer program a competitive advantage because of our partnership with carriers from all three of the major global alliances;


• | giving us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines; and


• | providing members of our alliance partners’ frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on Alaska, Virgin America and our regional partners while earning mileage credit in our partners’ programs.


Most of our codeshare relationships are free-sale codeshares, where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory, but takes no inventory risk. Our marketing agreements have various termination dates, and one or more may be in the process of renegotiation at any time. 
The comprehensive summary of Alaska's alliances with other airlines is as follows:

OTHER REVENUE
Other revenue consists of freight and mail, certain frequent flyer and ancillary revenue. While some of our product features are included in our base pricing, we have unbundled certain ancillary features that our guests separately value. Major ancillary revenue products include checked bag fees, change fees and lounge memberships. We also promote and sell products in-flight to enhance the guest experience, including our Tom Douglas signature meals, snacks, alcoholic beverages, in-flight entertainment and Wi-Fi. Total other revenue, excluding frequent flyer program revenue, represents about 7% of our total revenues.
GENERAL
The airline industry is highly competitive and subject to various uncertainties, including economic conditions, volatile fuel prices, industry instability, new competition, a largely unionized work force, the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital, government regulation—including taxes and fees, and potential aircraft incidents. Airlines have high fixed costs, primarily for wages, aircraft fuel, aircraft ownership and facilities rents. Because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly based on the number of passengers carried, a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results. In other words, a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating and financial results. Passenger demand and ticket prices are, in large measure, influenced by the general state of the economy, current global economic and political events, and total available airline seat capacity.
In 2017, the airline industry's profits declined when compared to the record setting year of 2016, primarily due to rising fuel prices, higher labor costs, and increased competitive fare actions reducing ticket prices. Despite some of these headwinds, the industry continued to report strong profits in 2017. In the current strong industry environment, airlines are making significant investments in airports, in more fuel-efficient planes and in new services to differentiate their customer service offering. Thus, the level of competition is expected to continue to increase. 
FUEL
Our business and financial results are highly affected by the price and the availability of aircraft fuel. The cost of aircraft fuel is volatile and outside of our control, and it can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results. Over the past five years, aircraft fuel expense ranged from 18% to 34% of operating expenses. Fuel prices are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil and refining margins and can vary by region in the U.S.

The prices we have paid for crude oil on an average annual basis for the past five years have ranged from a low of $43 per barrel in 2016 to a high of $98 in 2013. For us, a $1 per barrel change in the price of oil equates to approximately $19 million of fuel cost annually. Said another way, a one-cent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately $8 million per year.
Refining margins, which represent the price of refining crude oil into aircraft fuel, are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel but also contributed to the price volatility in recent years. Average annual West Coast refining margin prices have fluctuated between $13 per barrel and $36 per barrel in the last five years, and averaged $18 per barrel in 2017.
 10

Generally, West Coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the Gulf Coast or on the East Coast. Our average raw fuel cost per gallon increased 21% in 2017, after decreasing 19% in 2016 and 39% in 2015.
The percentages of our aircraft fuel expense by crude oil and refining margins, as well as the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense of operating expenses are as follows:

 | 2017 | | 2016 (a) | | 2015 | 2014 | | 2013
Crude oil | 66 | % | | 69 | % | 62 | % | | 72 | % | 71 | %
Refining margins | 23 | % | | 20 | % | 26 | % | | 18 | % | 19 | %
Other(b) | 11 | % | | 11 | % | 12 | % | | 10 | % | 10 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %
Aircraft fuel expense | 22 | % | | 18 | % | 22 | % | | 32 | % | 34 | %


(a) | Includes information for Virgin America for the period December 14, 2016 through December 31, 2016.


(b) | Other includes gains and losses on settled fuel hedges, unrealized mark-to-market fuel hedge gains or losses, taxes and other into-plane costs.

We use crude oil call options as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices. Call options effectively cap our pricing for crude oil, limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption. With call options, we are hedged against spikes in crude oil prices, and during a period of decline in crude oil prices, we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums. We begin hedging approximately 18 months in advance of crude oil consumption.
We believe that operating fuel-efficient aircraft is the best hedge against high fuel prices. Alaska operates an all-Boeing 737 fleet, Virgin America operates an all-Airbus A320 family fleet, and Horizon currently operates a fleet including Embraer 175 jet aircraft and Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft. Air Group's fuel-efficiency rate expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon (ASMs/g) improved from 75.3 ASMs/g in 2013 to 77.9 ASMs/g in 2017. These improvements have not only reduced our fuel consumption rate, but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our aircraft emit.
COMPETITION
Competition in the airline industry is intense and unpredictable. Our competitors consist primarily of other airlines and, to a lesser extent, other forms of transportation. Competition can be direct, in the form of another carrier flying the exact non-stop route, or indirect, where a carrier serves the same two cities non-stop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport. We compete with other domestic airlines and a limited number of international airlines on nearly all of our scheduled routes. Our largest competitor is Delta, who has significantly increased its capacity in Seattle over the past few years. Approximately 75% of our capacity to and from Seattle competes with Delta. As we grow in California and expand our transcontinental route offerings, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines have also become large competitors and have increased their capacity in markets we serve. Our California and transcontinental routes have a higher concentration of competitors when compared to our historical route structure which was predominately concentrated in the Pacific Northwest. Based on schedules filed with the U.S. Department of Transportation, we expect the amount of competitive capacity overlap with all carriers to increase by more than 6% in the first half of 2018, weighted based on our network. 
We believe that the following principal competitive factors are important to our guests:


• | Safety record

Safety is our top priority and is at the core of everything we do. In 2017, we were ranked by AirlineRatings.com as one of only two U.S. airlines in the Top 20 safest airlines in the world. We also received our 16th Diamond Award of Excellence from the Federal Aviation Administration, recognizing both Alaska and Horizon aircraft technicians for their commitment to training.


• | Customer service and reputation

We compete with other airlines in areas of customer service such as on-time performance, guest amenities—including first class and other premium seating, quality of on-board products, aircraft type and comfort. In 2017, Alaska Airlines ranked highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers by J.D. Power and Associates for the tenth year in a row. We have installed Boeing Space Bins on the majority of our Boeing 737-900ER fleet, providing additional overhead bin space for our guests. In 2017, we launched a Premium Class of service on our B737 aircraft that provides extra 
 11

legroom, early boarding, premium snacks and a complimentary alcoholic beverage. Additionally, in 2017 we increased the distance between seats in our first class cabins on the Alaska B737-900 and B737-900ER fleet, providing significantly more space for guests flying in the First Class cabin. We expect to fully complete the First Class cabin upgrades on the B737-900 and B737-900ER fleet in early 2018. 
Starting in 2018, we will begin reconfiguring the interior and livery of the Airbus fleet. The new livery and interior reconfiguration will provide guests a consistent brand experience across the Mainline fleet. The projects are expected to be complete in late 2019.
Our employees are a key element of our product. We have a highly engaged workforce that strives to provide a high degree of service and hospitality to our guests both at the airport and in flight. We heavily emphasize our service standards with our employees through training and education programs and monetary incentives related to operational performance and guest surveys.


• | Fares and ancillary services

Fare pricing is a significant competitive factor in the airline industry, and the increased availability of fare information on the Internet allows travelers to easily compare fares and identify competitor promotions and discounts. Pricing is driven by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, market-specific capacity, market share per route/geographic area, cost structure, fare vs. ancillary revenue strategies, and demand. 
For example, airlines often discount fares to drive traffic in new markets or to stimulate traffic when necessary to improve load factors. In addition, traditional network carriers have been able to reduce their operating costs through bankruptcies and mergers, while low-cost carriers have continued to grow their fleets and expand their networks, potentially enabling them to better control costs per available seat mile (the average cost to fly an aircraft seat one mile), which in turn may enable them to lower their fares. These factors can reduce our pricing power and that of the airline industry as a whole.
Domestic airline capacity is dominated by four large carriers, representing over 80% of total seats. Accordingly, if these carriers discount their fares or enter into our core markets, we must match those fares in order to maintain our load factors, often resulting in year-over-year decreases in our yields. We will defend our core markets and, if necessary, redeploy capacity to better match supply with demand. We believe the restructuring we've completed over the past decade has decreased our costs, enabling us to offer competitive fares while still earning returns for our shareholders.

• | Routes served, flight schedules, codesharing and interline relationships, and frequent flyer programs

We also compete with other airlines based on markets served, the frequency of service to those markets and frequent flyer opportunities. Some airlines have more extensive route structures than we do, and they offer significantly more international routes. In order to expand opportunities for our guests, we enter into codesharing and interline relationships with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges. These relationships allow us to offer our guests access to more destinations than we can on our own, gain exposure in markets we don't serve and allow our guests more opportunities to earn and redeem frequent flyer miles. The Mileage Plan™ offers some of the most comprehensive benefits to our members with the ability to earn and redeem miles on 18 partner carriers. 
In addition to domestic or foreign airlines that we compete with on most of our routes, we compete with ground transportation in our short-haul markets. To some extent, our airlines also compete with technology, such as video conferencing and internet-based meeting tools that have changed the need for, or frequency of, face-to-face business meetings.
TICKET DISTRIBUTION

Our tickets are distributed through three primary channels:


• | Direct to customer: It is less expensive for us to sell through our direct channels at alaskaair.com and virginamerica.com. As a result, we continue to take steps to drive more business to our websites. In addition, we believe these channels are preferable from a branding and customer-relationship standpoint in that we can establish ongoing communication with the customer and tailor offers accordingly.


• | Traditional and online travel agencies: Both traditional and online travel agencies typically use Global Distribution Systems (GDS) to obtain their fare and inventory data from airlines. Bookings made through these agencies result in a fee

 12

that is charged to the airline. Many of our large corporate customers require us to use these agencies. Some of our competitors do not use this distribution channel and, as a result, have lower ticket distribution costs.


• | Reservation call centers: Our call centers are located in Phoenix, AZ, Kent, WA, and Boise, ID. We generally charge a $15 fee for booking reservations through the call centers.

Our sales by channel are as follows: 

 | 2017 | | 2016 (a) | | 2015 | 2014 | | 2013
Direct to customer | 62 | % | | 61 | % | 60 | % | | 57 | % | 55 | %
Traditional agencies | 22 | % | | 23 | % | 23 | % | | 25 | % | 27 | %
Online travel agencies | 11 | % | | 11 | % | 11 | % | | 12 | % | 13 | %
Reservation call centers | 5 | % | | 5 | % | 6 | % | | 6 | % | 5 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %


(a) | Includes results for Virgin America for the period December 14, 2016 through December 31, 2016.

SEASONALITY AND OTHER FACTORS
Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to fewer departures and passengers. Profitability typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel, including increased activity in the state of Alaska. However, we have significantly improved the seasonality of our operations by our continued growth from the West Coast to leisure destinations, like Hawaii and Costa Rica, and expansion to leisure and business destinations in the mid-continental and eastern U.S.
In addition to passenger loads, factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include: 

• | pricing initiatives by us or our competitors,

•      changes in fuel costs, 

• | increases in competition at our primary airports,


• | general economic conditions and resulting changes in passenger demand, and


• | increases or decreases in passenger and volume-driven variable costs.


Many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter, causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft, canceling flights and accommodating displaced passengers. Due to our geographic area of operations, we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions, particularly in the state of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest, than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread weather-related risks over larger route systems. We also are susceptible to Air Traffic Control due to our heavy concentration of departures from Seattle and San Francisco. 
No material part of our business, or that of our subsidiaries, is dependent upon a single customer, or upon a few high-volume customers.
EMPLOYEES
Our business is labor intensive. As of December 31, 2017, we employed 23,156 (13,896 at Alaska, 3,538 at Virgin America, 3,943 at Horizon, and 1,779 at McGee Air Services) active full-time and part-time employees. Wages and benefits, including variable incentive pay, represented approximately 39% of our total non-fuel operating expenses in 2017 and 40% in 2016.
Most major airlines, including Alaska, Virgin America, and Horizon, have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements (CBA). Airlines with unionized work forces generally have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces, and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition or slowing demand. 
 13

As part of the integration, we have been working to bring represented Alaska Airlines and Virgin America work groups under single collective bargaining agreements. The process for combining workgroups begins with the union filing a petition with the National Mediation Board (NMB), at which point the NMB performs a review to assess a ‘single carrier determination’ for the airlines. Following this single carrier determination, the NMB makes a representation determination depending on size of the pre-merger bargaining units and will either extend the certification if one is significantly larger than the other or require a vote.  Once representation is determined, the NMB certifies the union as the bargaining representative for the work group. The parties must also work together to achieve agreed upon single collective bargaining agreements.  Integration also requires the pre-merger work groups to agree upon and finalize integrated seniority lists. As of December 31, 2017 we have labor integration agreements with pilots and clerical, office, and passenger services employees, meaning all agreements are completed to define how and when we will combine the Alaska and Virgin America groups into one. The remaining work groups are still in process of completing similar such agreements. The time frame to reach single CBA and full transition to work rules for each group will vary. 
At December 31, 2017, labor unions represented 84% of Alaska’s, 84% of Virgin America's, 44% of Horizon’s, and 90% of McGee Air Services' employees. 
Our relations with U.S. labor organizations are governed by the Railway Labor Act (RLA). Under the RLA, collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date. If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the RLA and/or described in the agreement. After receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either party may request the NMB to initiate a process including mediation, arbitration, and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in self-help.

REGULATION

GENERAL

The airline industry is highly regulated, most notably by the federal government. The Department of Transportation (DOT), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers.

 17


• | DOT: In order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation in the U.S., a domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the DOT. Subject to certain individual airport capacity, noise and other restrictions, this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two points in the U.S. Certificates do not expire, but may be revoked for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes, regulations, orders or the terms of the certificates. While airlines are permitted to establish their own fares without government regulation, the DOT has jurisdiction over the approval of international codeshare agreements, marketing alliance agreements between major domestic carriers, international and some domestic route authorities, Essential Air Service market subsidies, carrier liability for personal or property damage, and certain airport rates and charges disputes. International treaties may also contain restrictions or requirements for flying outside of the U.S. and impose different carrier liability limits than those applicable to domestic flights. The DOT has been active in implementing a variety of “consumer protection” regulations, covering subjects such as advertising, passenger communications, denied boarding compensation and tarmac delay response. Airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the DOT from time to time for alleged violations of consumer protection and other economic regulations. We are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate.


• | FAA: The FAA, through Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs), generally regulates all aspects of airline operations, including establishing personnel, maintenance and flight operation standards. Domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air carrier operating certificate issued by the FAA. Pursuant to these regulations, we have established, and the FAA has approved, our operations specifications and a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate. Each maintenance program provides for the ongoing maintenance of the relevant aircraft type, ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls. From time to time, the FAA issues airworthiness directives (ADs) that must be incorporated into our aircraft maintenance program and operations. All airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the FAA from time to time for alleged violations of FARs or ADs. At this time, we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate.


• | TSA: Airlines serving the U.S. must operate a TSA-approved Aircraft Operator Standard Security Program (AOSSP), and comply with TSA Security Directives (SDs) and regulations. Under TSA authority, we are required to collect a September 11 Security Fee of $5.60 per one-way trip from passengers and remit that sum to the government to fund aviation security measures. Airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the TSA from time to time for alleged violations of the AOSSP, SDs or security regulations. We are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate.

The Department of Justice and DOT have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters. The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services. Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act. To the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers, we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies and international treaties.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY MATTERS

We are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the U.S. and other countries. We are also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, OSHA, and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations. We maintain our safety, health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements.
In the future there may be legislation to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions. Over the course of several years, we have transitioned to more fuel-efficient aircraft fleets and reduced our emissions with the goal of continuing that trend.
The Airport Noise and Capacity Act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system. Authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews. We believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions.

Although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters, individually or collectively, will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods.
 18

INSURANCE
We carry insurance of types customary in the airline industry and in amounts deemed adequate to protect our interests and property and to comply both with federal regulations and certain credit and lease agreements. The insurance policies principally provide coverage for Airline Hull, Spares and Comprehensive Legal Liability, War and Allied Perils, and Workers’ Compensation. In addition, we currently carry a Cyber Insurance policy in the event of security breaches from malicious parties. 
We believe that our emphasis on safety and our state-of-the-art flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of our insurance.
