 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Founded in 1941, Coach, Inc., the predecessor to Tapestry, Inc. (the "Company"), was incorporated in the state of Maryland in 2000. During fiscal 2015, the Company acquired Stuart Weitzman Holdings LLC, a luxury women's footwear company. During fiscal 2018, the Company acquired Kate Spade & Company, a lifestyle accessories and ready-to-wear company. Later in fiscal 2018, the Company changed its name to Tapestry, Inc.
Tapestry, Inc. is a leading New York-based house of accessible luxury accessories and lifestyle brands. Our global house of brands unites the magic of Coach, kate spade new york and Stuart Weitzman. Each of our brands are unique and independent, while sharing a commitment to innovation and authenticity defined by distinctive products and differentiated customer experiences across channels and geographies. We use our collective strengths to move our customers and empower our communities, to make the fashion industry more sustainable, and to build a company that’s equitable, inclusive, and diverse. Individually, our brands are iconic. Together, we can stretch what’s possible.
OUR STRATEGY
In fiscal 2020, the Company announced and embarked on a strategic multi-year growth plan (the "Acceleration Program"). The guiding principle under the Acceleration Program is to better meet the needs of each of its brands' unique customers by:
•Sharpening our Focus on the Consumer: Operating with a clearly defined purpose and strategy for each brand and an unwavering focus on the consumer at the core of everything we do.
•Leveraging Data and Leading with a Digital-First Mindset: Building significant data and analytics capabilities to drive decision-making and increase efficiency; Offering immersive customer experiences across our e-commerce and social channels to meet the needs of consumers who are increasingly utilizing digital platforms to engage with brands; Rethinking the role of stores with an intent to optimize our fleet.
•Transforming into a Leaner and More Responsive Organization: Moving with greater agility, simplifying internal processes and empowering teams to act quickly to meet the rapidly changing needs of the consumer. The Company achieved approximately $200 million and $300 million of annual gross run rate expense savings in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, respectively.
The Company does not expect to incur expenses related to the Acceleration Program in the fiscal year ending July 1, 2023 ("fiscal 2023").
Covid-19 Impact
The outbreak of Covid-19 has continued to impact a significant majority of the regions in which we operate, resulting in significant global business disruptions. In response, the Company took strategic actions to reinforce its liquidity and financial flexibility, as well as to comply with local regulations to protect employees and customers. While the ongoing pandemic continues to present challenges, such as the supply chain related pressures facing the industry, increased freight costs, temporary closures and other additional necessary actions to protect our stakeholders, the Company has been adapting to the current environment by remaining flexible in the short-term while continuing to focus on its long-term strategy and multi-year growth agenda. 
OUR BRANDS
The Company has three reportable segments:
•Coach includes global sales of Coach products to customers through Coach operated stores, including e-commerce sites and concession shop-in-shops, and sales to wholesale customers and through independent third party distributors. This segment represented 73.6% of total net sales in fiscal 2022.
•Kate Spade includes global sales primarily of kate spade new york brand products to customers through Kate Spade operated stores, including e-commerce sites and concession shop-in-shops, sales to wholesale customers and through independent third party distributors. This segment represented 21.6% of total net sales in fiscal 2022.
•Stuart Weitzman includes global sales of Stuart Weitzman brand products primarily through Stuart Weitzman operated stores, sales to wholesale customers, through e-commerce sites and through independent third party distributors. This segment represented 4.8% of total net sales in fiscal 2022.
Corporate, which is not a reportable segment, represents certain costs that are not directly attributable to a brand. These costs primarily include administrative and information systems expense. 
Coach
Founded in 1941, Coach is a leading design house of accessible luxury accessories and lifestyle collections, with a long-standing reputation built on quality craftsmanship. Defined by a free-spirited, all-American attitude, the brand approaches design with a modern vision, reimagining luxury for today with an authenticity and innovation that is uniquely Coach.

Stores — Coach operates freestanding retail stores, including flagships, and outlet stores as well as concession shop-in-shop locations. These stores are located in regional shopping centers, metropolitan areas throughout the world and established outlet centers.
Retail stores carry an assortment of products depending on their size, location and customer preferences. Coach operates a limited number of flagship stores that offer the fullest expression of the Coach brand and are located in tourist-heavy, densely populated cities globally. Coach outlet stores serve as an efficient means to sell manufactured-for-outlet product and discontinued retail inventory outside the retail channel. The outlet store design, visual presentations and customer service levels support and reinforce the brand's image. Through these outlet stores, we target value-oriented customers in established outlet centers that are close to major markets.

DESIGN AND MERCHANDISING
Our creative leaders are responsible for conceptualizing and implementing the design direction for our brands across the consumer touchpoints of product, stores and marketing. At Tapestry, each brand has a dedicated design and merchandising team; this ensures that Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman speak to their customers with a voice and positioning unique to their brand. Designers have access to the brands' extensive archives of product designs, which are a valuable resource for new product concepts. Our designers collaborate with strong merchandising teams that analyze sales, market trends and consumer preferences to identify market opportunities that help guide each season's design process and create a globally relevant product assortment. Leveraging our strategic investments in data and analytics tools across Tapestry's platform, merchandisers are able to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior that empowers our teams to respond to changes in consumer preferences and demand as well as scale opportunities across brands with greater speed and efficiency. Our merchandising teams are committed to managing the product life cycle to maximize sales and profitability across all channels. The product category teams, each comprised of design, merchandising, product development and sourcing specialists help each brand execute design concepts that are consistent with the brand's strategic direction.
Our design and merchandising teams also work in close collaboration with all of our licensing partners to ensure that the licensed products are conceptualized and designed to address the intended market opportunity and convey the distinctive perspective and lifestyle associated with our brands. 
MARKETING
We use a 360-degree approach to marketing for each of our brands, synchronizing our efforts across all channels to ensure consistency at every touchpoint. Our global marketing strategy is to deliver a consistent, relevant and multi-layered message every time the consumer comes in contact with our brands through our communications and visual merchandising. Each brand's distinctive positioning is communicated by our creative marketing, visual merchandising and public relations teams, as well as outside creative agencies. We also have a sophisticated consumer and market research capability, which helps us assess consumer attitudes and trends.
We engage in several consumer communication initiatives globally, including direct marketing activities at a national, regional and local level. Total expenses attributable to the Company's marketing-related activities in fiscal 2022 were $551.6 million, or approximately 8% of net sales, compared to $395.2 million in fiscal 2021, or approximately 7% of net sales. 
Our wide range of marketing activities utilize a variety of media, including digital, social, print and out-of-home. Our respective brand websites serve as effective communication vehicles by providing an immersive brand experience, showcasing the fullest expression across all product categories.
As part of our direct marketing strategy, we use databases of consumers to generate personalized communications in direct channels such as email and text messages to drive engagement and build awareness. Email contacts are an important part of our communication and are sent to selected consumers to stimulate consumer purchases and build brand awareness. Visitors to our e-commerce sites provide an opportunity to increase the size of these consumer databases, in addition to serving as a point of transactions globally, except where restricted.
The Company has several regional informational websites for locations where we have not established an e-commerce presence. The Company utilizes and continues to explore digital technologies such as social media websites as a cost effective consumer communication opportunity to increase on-line and store sales, acquire new customers and build brand awareness.
MANUFACTURING
Tapestry carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of “better brand” partners that have demonstrated integrity, quality and reliable delivery. The Company continues to evaluate new manufacturing sources and geographies to deliver the finest quality products at the best cost and to mitigate the impact of manufacturing in inflationary markets. 
Our raw material suppliers, independent manufacturers and licensing partners must achieve and maintain high quality standards, which are an integral part of our brands' identity. Before partnering with a new manufacturing vendor for finished goods, the Company evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards review. In addition, for manufacturers of finished goods we request a social compliance report that was conducted within six months of the date of submission. Suppliers that fail to meet our standards are not approved until an acceptable report is provided. Periodic evaluations of existing, previously approved facilities are conducted on a recurring basis. We believe that our manufacturing partners are in material compliance with the Company’s integrity standards. 
These independent manufacturers each or in aggregate support a broad mix of product types, materials and a seasonal influx of new, fashion-oriented styles, which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences. 
We have longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware. Although our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers, we maintain a strong level of oversight in the selection of the raw materials and compliance with quality control standards is monitored through on-site quality inspections at independent manufacturing facilities.
We maintain strong oversight of the supply chain process for each of our brands from design through manufacturing. We are able to do this by maintaining sourcing management offices in Vietnam, mainland China, the Philippines, Cambodia and Spain that work closely with our independent manufacturers. This broad-based, global manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost, lead times and construction capabilities. We have and may continue to experience disruptions at third-party manufacturing facilities across certain geographies due to Covid-19. Refer to "Executive Overview" in Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for additional information.
During fiscal 2022, manufacturers of Coach products were primarily located in Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines and Indonesia and no individual vendor provided 10% or more of the brand's total purchases. During fiscal 2022, Kate Spade products were manufactured primarily in Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia and China. Kate Spade had one vendor, located in Indonesia, who individually provided over 10% of the brand's total purchases (or approximately 11%). Stuart Weitzman products were primarily manufactured in Spain. During fiscal 2022, Stuart Weitzman had four vendors, all located in Spain, who individually provided over 10% of the brand's total units (or approximately 44% in the aggregate).
FULFILLMENT
The Company’s fulfillment network is designed to ship each brand's products from our manufacturers to fulfillment centers around the world for inspection, storage, order processing and delivery. These fulfillment centers are either directly operated by the Company or operated by independent third parties, and the Company leverages multi-brand fulfillment centers where appropriate. Our facilities use bar code scanning warehouse management systems, where our fulfillment center employees use handheld scanners to read product bar codes. This allows for accurate storage and order processing, and allows us to provide excellent service to our customers. Our products are primarily shipped to retail stores, wholesale customers and e-commerce customers. 
Product fulfillment occurs at facilities throughout the world that are either company run or managed by third parties. In North America we maintain fulfillment centers in Jacksonville, Florida, and West Chester, Ohio, operated by Tapestry. Globally we utilize fulfillment centers in mainland China, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Spain, owned and operated by third-parties. We also utilize local fulfillment centers, through third-parties in Japan, parts of Greater China (mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Macao SAR, and Taiwan), South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Spain, the U.K., Canada, Australia, and starting in fiscal 2023 in Mexico which will support the market in the United States. These facilities utilize automated warehouse management systems that interface to our Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system.
In fiscal 2022, the Company entered into a lease agreement for a facility to be located in Las Vegas, Nevada. This facility is expected to become a multi-brand fulfillment center that is intended to increase capacity and continue to enhance fulfillment capabilities. 
INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
The Company’s information systems are integral in supporting the Company’s long-term strategies. Our information technology platform is a key capability used to support digital growth and drive consumer centricity and data-driven decision making. We are continually working on enhancing our digital technology platforms and elevating our e-commerce capabilities through new functionalities to our direct-to-consumer channels, including enhancements to our omni-channel, utilizing cloud based technology infrastructure. 
The Company began implementing a point-of-sale system in fiscal 2021 which supports all in-store transactions, distributes management reporting for each store, and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis. This daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment. The implementation is complete for Coach, Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade Europe stores. The Kate Spade North America rollout is in-progress, and expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.
The Company maintains global information security and privacy compliance programs, comprised of risk management policies and procedures surrounding the Company’s information systems, cybersecurity practices and protection of consumer and employee personal data and confidential information. The Board of Directors has ultimate oversight of the Company’s risk management policies and procedures, and has delegated primary responsibility for monitoring the risks and programs in this area to the Audit Committee, which receives quarterly updates on information security and privacy risk and compliance. The Board of Directors receives periodic updates on these topics as well. As part of the Company’s compliance programs, all global employees are required to take annual training on information security, including cybersecurity, and global data privacy requirements and compliance measures. We also conduct periodic internal and third party assessments to test our cybersecurity controls, perform cyber simulations and annual tabletop exercises, and continually evaluate our privacy notices, policies and procedures surrounding our handling and control of personal data and the systems we have in place to help protect us from cybersecurity or personal data breaches. Additionally, we maintain network security and cyber liability insurance in order to provide a level of financial protection in the event of certain covered cyber losses and data breaches.
TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS
Tapestry owns all of the material trademark rights around the world used in connection with the production, marketing, distribution and sale of all branded products for Coach, Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade. In addition, it licenses trademarks and copyrights used in connection with the production, marketing and distribution of certain categories of goods and limited edition collaborative special projects. Tapestry also owns and maintains registrations in countries around the world for trademarks in relevant classes of products. Major trademarks include TAPESTRY, COACH, STUART WEITZMAN, KATE SPADE and kate spade new york. It also owns brand-specific trademarks such as COACH and Horse & Carriage Design, COACH and Story Patch Design, COACH and Lozenge Design, COACH and Tag Design, Signature C Design for the COACH brand; kate spade new york and Spade Design, and spade flower monogram for the kate spade new york brand; and the stacked Stuart Weitzman Logo for the Stuart Weitzman brand. Tapestry is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although Tapestry believes that the Coach, Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade names are important for its business. In addition, Tapestry owns a number of design patents and utility patents for its brands' product designs. Tapestry aggressively polices its trademarks, and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally. It pursues counterfeiters through leads generated internally, as well as through its network of investigators, the respective online reporting form for each brand, the Tapestry hotline and business partners around the world.
The Company expects that its material trademarks will remain in full force and effect for as long as it continues to use and renew them. 
SEASONALITY
The Company's results are typically affected by seasonal trends. During the first fiscal quarter, we typically build inventory for the winter and holiday season. In the second fiscal quarter, working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income, especially during the holiday season. In fiscal 2022, due to the increased in-transit times, the Company started to build inventory in the fourth fiscal quarter for the fiscal 2023 winter and holiday season.
Fluctuations in net sales, operating income and operating cash flows of the Company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales, including macroeconomic events, such as Covid-19, or adverse weather conditions.
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Most of the Company's imported products are subject to duties, indirect taxes, quotas and non-tariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the U.S. and other countries or may impact the cost of such products. The Company is not materially restricted by quotas or other government restrictions in the operation of its business, however customs duties do represent a component of total product cost. To maximize opportunities, the Company operates complex supply chains through foreign trade zones, bonded logistic parks and other strategic initiatives such as free trade agreements. For example, we have historically received benefits from duty-free imports on certain products from certain countries pursuant to the U.S. General System of Preferences ("GSP") program. The GSP program expired in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, resulting in additional duties that have negatively impacted gross margin. Additionally, the Company operates a direct import business in many countries worldwide. As a result, the Company is subject to stringent government regulations and restrictions with respect to its cross-border activity either by the various customs and border protection agencies or by other government 
agencies which control the quality and safety of the Company’s products. The Company maintains an internal global trade, customs and product compliance organization to help manage its import/export and regulatory affairs activity.
COMPETITION
The product categories in which we operate are highly competitive. The Company competes primarily with European and American luxury and accessible luxury brands as well as private label retailers. In varying degrees, depending on the product category involved, we compete on the basis of style, price, customer service, quality, brand prestige and recognition, among others. Over the last decade, these luxury and accessible luxury brands have grown and are expected to continue to grow, encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors. This increased competition drives interest in these brand loyal categories. We believe, however, that we have significant competitive advantages because of the recognition of our brands and the acceptance of our brands by consumers.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
As a people-centered and purpose led Company, Tapestry’s corporate responsibility framework, Our Social Fabric, unites teams across the Company’s business to work to meet our 2025 Corporate Responsibility Goals ("2025 Goals") and a shared objective: to create the accessible luxury company of the future that balances true fashion authority with meaningful, positive change. Our Social Fabric focuses on three pillars: Our People, Our Planet and Our Communities.
•Our People:
◦We aim to bolster Tapestry’s purpose and culture by embedding equity, inclusion and diversity throughout our organization, holding our leaders accountable for our equity, inclusion and diversity ("EI&D") goals and attracting and retaining talent with a compelling and fulfilling employee experience.
◦We have set 2025 goals focused on building diversity in our leadership team, reducing differences in our employee survey results based on gender and ethnicity, focusing on progression and establishing core wellness standards to enable our employees to manage their work and personal lives.

•Our Planet: 
◦We aim to sustain and restore our planet through continuous innovation in solutions that improve biodiversity and reduce our impact on climate change with a focus on renewable energy, increased use of environmentally preferred materials and production methods, and circular business models that design out waste and pollution, keep products in use, and restore natural systems.
◦We have set 2025 goals focused on utilizing 100% renewable energy in our own operations; tracing and mapping our raw materials, environmentally responsible sourcing of leather, increasing the recycled content of our packaging, reducing waste in our corporate and distribution centers and water across our company and supply chain. We have also committed to setting science-based emissions reduction targets in line with Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi's) criteria and 1.5⁰C. 
•Our Communities:
◦We aim to support and empower the communities where our employees live and work, and provide the resources and investment needed to strengthen the regions where we operate, through volunteer efforts, philanthropic initiatives, product donations, and social impact programming.
◦We have set 2025 goals focused on volunteerism programs, philanthropic initiatives and supply chain empowerment programs.
The Company’s corporate responsibility strategy, including oversight, management and identification of risks, is ultimately governed by Board of Directors and overseen by an Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance ("ESG") Steering Committee, which is comprised of members of our executive leadership team, and driven by an ESG Task Force, which is comprised of senior leaders and cross-functional members from major business functions. The Board approves long-term sustainability goals, strategic moves or major plans of action and receives updates at least annually. Tapestry's Governance and Nominations Committee of the Board receives quarterly updates on sustainability strategy, including climate-related topics, progress towards the 2025 goals and other ESG related initiatives. 
The Company is a signatory to the United Nations ("UN") Global Compact, and as such, our corporate responsibility strategy is aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

HUMAN CAPITAL
At Tapestry, being true to yourself is core to who we are. When each of us brings our individuality to our collective ambition, our creativity is unleashed. This global house of brands was built by unconventional entrepreneurs and unexpected solutions, so when we say we believe in dreams, we mean we believe in making them happen. 
Where differences intersect, new thinking emerges. So we cultivate a place for people who are both warm and rigorous, work that is both challenging and fun, a culture led by both head and heart. Most of all, we bring together the unique spirits of our people and our brands and give them a place to move their work and our industry forward. We believe that difference sparks brilliance, so we welcome people and ideas from everywhere to join us in stretching what’s possible.
Governance and Oversight
Our Board of Directors and its committees provide governance and oversight of the Company's strategy, including over issues of human capital management. The Board has designated the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors (the “HR Committee”) as the primary committee responsible for the Company’s human capital strategy, overseeing executive compensation programs, performance and talent development, succession planning, engagement and regular review of employee benefits and well-being strategies. Together with the Board, the HR Committee also provides oversight of the Company’s EI&D strategies. The full Board of Directors and the HR Committee receive at least quarterly updates on the Company’s talent development strategies and other applicable areas of human capital management.
Unlocking the power of our people is a key strategic focus area for the Company, supported by significant engagement from the Company’s senior leadership on talent development and human capital management, as reflected in the key programs and focus areas described below.
Employees
As of July 2, 2022, the Company employed approximately 18,100 employees globally. Of these employees, approximately 14,400 employees worked in retail locations, of which 5,500 were part-time employees. This total excludes seasonal and temporary employees that the Company employs, particularly during the second quarter due to the holiday season. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are good, and has never encountered a strike or work stoppage.
Equity, Inclusion and Diversity
Our company name Tapestry, represents the diversity of our brands and the diversity of our people. We know that having a diverse range of perspectives, backgrounds and experiences makes us more innovative and successful and it brings us closer to our consumer. Our goal is to create a culture that is equitable, inclusive and diverse - where all of our employees, customers and stakeholders thrive. 
Our EI&D strategy is grounded in our purpose and values and will be a core element to unlocking the power of our people. There are four pillars under this strategy:
•Talent. Attracting, retaining and developing top talent with a compelling and fulfilling employee experience.
•Culture. Empower people to express their distinctive strengths and power our engine of growth through leadership development, education and engagement programs.
•Community. Serve the communities in which we live and work through strategic partnerships that advance EI&D priorities.
•Marketplace. Develop solutions that set the standard for excellence through our platform of brands – for employees, customers, vendors, suppliers and our investors.
The Company has established an Inclusion Council, led by a diverse team of passionate employees, as well as several employee resource groups (“ERGs”) and task forces, connecting our employees to communities with the support of their colleagues and encouraging cultural awareness. In fiscal 2022 the Company appointed a Chief Inclusion and Social Impact Officer, a newly created position to continue to shape and deliver the Company's EI&D strategy and oversee the Company's social impact efforts through advocacy, philanthropy and volunteerism. 
Additionally, we believe educating our employees is crucial in achieving our EI&D goals. We have established a global multi-year EI&D learning road map, including bespoke inclusion and unconscious bias training programs to accommodate our dynamic employee population. In fiscal 2022 the Company launched Inclusion Works, a peer learning online platform with a group-centered experience, bite-size content, and actionable learning. Furthermore, the Company has focused on providing employees with resources to foster continuing education and conversation on EI&D through 'Tapestry UNSCRIPTED', which is an internal speaker series for our employees designed to bring our values to life. We feel hosting bold conversations about our values provides an opportunity for us to be inspired, discover ideas, and ignite personal passions.
Tapestry is committed to the support of underrepresented groups through our corporate efforts. We are a member of the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, the largest business coalition committed to advancing Diversity and Inclusion. Our focus on fostering an equitable work environment has led to continued recognition from Forbes on the list of “Best Employers for Diversity” and Human Rights Campaign’s list of “Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality”. Additionally, we have been certified as a "Great Place to Work" for 2022. The Company is dedicated to building a workforce with leadership teams better reflecting our general corporate population in North America. The Company monitors the representation of women and ethnic minorities at different levels throughout the company, and discloses this information in our website at www.tapestry.com/responsibility/our-people.
Total Rewards
Tapestry is dedicated to being a place where our employees love to work, where they feel recognized and rewarded for all that they do. Maintaining a competitive program helps us attract, motivate and retain the key talent we need to achieve outstanding business and financial results. To accomplish this goal, we strive to appropriately align our total compensation with the pay, benefits and rewards offered by companies that compete with us for talent in the marketplace. 
Our Total Compensation Program includes cash pay, annual and long term incentives, benefits and other special programs that our employees value. We strive to pay each employee fairly and competitively across our brands. Tapestry's primary compensation principle is to "pay for performance." Tapestry's practice is to pay a competitive base salary and to provide employees with the opportunity to earn an annual bonus tied to Tapestry's and its brands' financial performance. Approximately 2,000 of our employees, including nearly all of our store managers, received an annual long term equity award in 2022, which align employee interests with those of our stockholders, rewards employees for enhancing stock holder value and supports retention of key employees. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, Tapestry announced that it is committing to a $15 U.S. minimum wage for hourly employees. 
Our benefits package is designed to be competitive and comprehensive, which varies by location and jurisdiction. Our benefits, along with competitive pay, includes medical benefits and paid wellness days and parental leave, in accordance with local policies and regulations, for directly hired full-time and part-time employees. In fiscal 2022 we transitioned from sick days to wellness days to better reflect the purpose of this paid time off. The Company also offers retirement benefits for its employees, which are managed in accordance with local jurisdictions. To support employees in achieving their career and financial goals, the Company also provides access to learning opportunities on personal finances as well as physical and mental wellness through various platforms as available based on location.
Talent Acquisition and Development
Hiring talented employees is critically important to us, as we consider our employees around the world to be our greatest asset. Our recruitment and sourcing strategy focuses on tapping diverse sources to attract the best talent to our organization and then retaining them through our continued investments in resources that provide our employees with the tools for career advancement. Our internal opportunity program encourages employees to stretch themselves in their career development, aligning their capabilities with career interests and goals. We strive to provide a working environment where our people can grow and progress their careers within the Company. 
We are committed to helping our employees develop the knowledge, skills and abilities needed for continued success, and encourage employee development at all levels and every career stage. Our development programs enable individual and team success through targeted initiatives and resources, offering a wide-ranging curriculum focused on professional and leadership development for leaders, managers, and individual contributors, including through our Common Thread people management program, Emerging Leaders High-Potential Program, Leader Transition Acceleration Program, and third-party learning platforms in addition to other trainings and education facilitated through the Company for all employees. 
As a company, performance management is critical to our ability to reach our goals and foster a culture of success. By having a dynamic, performance-driven culture, we can achieve greater results, maximize employee, manager and team performance and offer exciting development and career opportunities. As our focus extends beyond the performance of our employees to the performance of our Company as a whole, we have mechanisms in place to facilitate comprehensive upward feedback through robust cross-functional feedback tools and a cadence of regular pulse surveys that inform on how we can continue to strive for excellence in our work culture. 
Well-being and Safety
At Tapestry, we are committed to providing a safe working environment for our people, as well as supporting our people in achieving and maintaining their health and well-being goals. Work-life integration is top of mind, and we provide resources and benefits to help achieve this balance. We provide our employees with supplemental resources to achieve wellness such as access to our Employee Assistance Program, regular employee programming and subscriptions to Headspace, a smartphone application dedicated to meditation and mindfulness. 
At Tapestry, we believe in encouraging and empowering our employees to take part in building a welcoming and inclusive community. We provide all employees with supplemental time-off to perform community service through nonprofits of their personal choice and through team and Company sponsored volunteering events. In our commitment to supporting our communities, we have three foundations which provide monetary support to nonprofit organizations across communities that we are a part of. Additionally, on an annual basis, our foundations match up to $10,000 in donations to eligible non-profits per employee in North America. 
Beginning in fiscal 2020, we had to make changes to our operations in order to continue to prioritize the health and safety of our people in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. To do so, we engaged medical professionals to consult on our health and safety protocols and provide Covid-19 education webinars for our employees on topics ranging from pandemic safety, vaccine education and mental wellness. We have also provided our employees with additional paid time off to receive their Covid-19 vaccine, booster and to recover from any resulting side effects. As the landscape of this pandemic evolves, we continue to adapt and enforce safety protocols at our retail stores, distribution centers and corporate offices. Our corporate offices have transitioned to a hybrid model, with flexible work options for most of our corporate employees. However, we continue to monitor and comply with all local and federal Covid-19 guidance and adjust our operations accordingly. Refer to the "Executive Overview" in Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for additional information about the Company's response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
