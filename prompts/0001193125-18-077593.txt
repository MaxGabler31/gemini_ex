Overview 
 Veritone, Inc. (collectively with our subsidiaries, referred to as Veritone, Company, we, our, and us) is a provider of artificial intelligence, or AI, computing solutions. We have developed aiWARE, a proprietary AI operating system that unlocks the power of cognitive computing to transform audio, video and other unstructured data and analyze it in conjunction with structured data in a seamless, orchestrated and automated manner to generate actionable intelligence. Our aiWARE platform, or A1 platform, integrates and orchestrates an open ecosystem of best-of-breed cognitive engines, together with our suite of powerful applications, to reveal valuable multivariate insights from vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. 
 Our platform incorporates proprietary technology to integrate and intelligently orchestrate a wide variety of cognitive engine capabilities to mimic human cognitive functions such as perception, reasoning, prediction and problem solving in order to quickly, efficiently and cost effectively transform unstructured data into structured data. It stores the results in a time-correlated database, creating a rich, online, searchable index of the structured and unstructured data that users can use and analyze in near real-time through the platforms suite of applications to drive business processes and insights. Our platform is based on an open architecture that enables new cognitive engines and applications to be added quickly and efficiently, resulting in a future proof, scalable and evolving solution that can be easily leveraged for a broad range of industries that capture or use audio, video and other unstructured data, including, without limitation, media, legal, government, politics and other commercial and retail vertical markets. 
 We offer our aiWARE platform through a software-as-a-service (SaaS) delivery model, with multiple deployment options, including a fully cloud-based option on both commercial and secure government cloud instances, and a hybrid on-premises/cloud option, which allows users to maintain their data and perform AI-based processing using network-isolated cognitive engines on premises behind the users firewalls, with the ability to perform additional processing using cloud-based cognitive engines and to search and analyze results through our SaaS suite of applications. In addition, we are currently developing a version of aiWARE that will allow users to utilize certain cognitive engines and substantially all of the other features and functionality of our cloud-based aiWARE in a fully on-premises environment. 
 In December 2017, we acquired the advanced data analytics software and related intellectual property assets of Atigeo Corporation, including a cooperative distributed inferencing system  based on Hamiltonian models and other proprietary algorithms  that enables queries within huge bodies of unstructured data where straight computational, traditional machine learning and manual approaches are impractical, if not impossible. This strategic acquisition adds proprietary machine learning capabilities to our growing body of technology and intellectual property in data science and will help us further refine our conducted learning. We are in the process of incorporating portions of this technology into our aiWARE platform, which will further advance our intelligent orchestration of cognitive engines and expand the platforms ability to understand substantially all data types. 
 We plan to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic investments in businesses and technologies that strengthen our AI platform, enhance our capabilities and/or expand our market presence in our core vertical markets or in new markets. 
 We also operate a full service media advertising agency, which we acquired at the time Veritone was founded in 2014. Our services include media planning and strategy, media buying and placement, campaign messaging, clearance verification and attribution, and custom analytics. Since our inception, we have generated most of our revenues from this media agency business. We are in the early stages of developing our AI platform business and, although we intend to focus on our AI platform business, we plan to continue to invest in and grow our media advertising agency business.

AI Platform Business 
 Our innovative aiWARE platform intelligently orchestrates an ecosystem of best-of-breed cognitive engines within a single software solution to process information in volumes that can far exceed human cognitive capabilities. Our proprietary technology enables users to run comprehensive, multivariate queries, correlations and analyses in near real-time using multiple cognitive engines and data sets, creating integrated and refined outputs. Our solution can also ingest and analyze structured data for correlation with the processed data. For example, our media users can use our system to identify instances where advertiser names or logos appear in a broadcast, and then correlate those instances with Nielsen ratings data to measure the number of impressions generated by the ad, web traffic data to estimate the traffic driven by the ad, or their own sales data, to provide actionable intelligence regarding their advertising campaigns. In addition, by using multiple cognitive engines from different providers within the same class and/or across different classes, our aiWARE platform can generate extensive and varied training data to more efficiently learn and thereby quickly improve accuracy and analyses. A key principle of AI-based systems is that the more data that is ingested and processed, the better the accuracy and predictive value that can be achieved. 
 Our aiWARE platform encompasses the following processes, which are discussed in more detail below: 
 

 | Ingestion: Data often exists in a myriad of formats. Our platform captures and ingests public and private media (structured and unstructured data sets in most digital formats and various protocols) through various adapters that are specific to each ingestion source. In the process, ingested source data is normalized and stored locally, in the cloud or in both locations, depending on the deployment model chosen.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Orchestration and Processing: Once source data is captured into our platform through the ingestion process, we transform (transcode) the media into a suitable format for processing. The media is then run through one or more cognitive engines depending on the information and analysis desired by the end user, which extract and/or add useful metadata from and to the media. Our proprietary Conductor technology analyzes source data files and intelligently routes them to the most appropriate cognitive engine(s) within one or more cognitive classes to optimize the performance, cost and speed of the data analysis process.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Proprietary Indexing and Storage: The metadata produced by our cognitive processing is indexed and stored in a temporal elastic database that correlates disparate metadata derived from various cognitive engines across our platform and from third-party data sets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Applications and Cognitive Analytics: Once the media has been indexed and stored, cognitive analytics can be deployed to uncover relationships, enable insights and recommend actions. We have developed a suite of SaaS-based applications to facilitate the use of our platform and enable users to discover patterns across a diverse set of media to correlate data, optimize objectives and provide near real-time insights.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ingestion and Adapters 
 We have built a scalable, source and type agnostic media ingestion process that utilizes adapters, which are lightweight, pluggable software modules purpose-built to capture media from wherever it resides, to ingest media into our platform for further processing, actions and analytics. Adapters are specific to the ingestion source type and allow for media from that source to be processed via the Veritone recording infrastructure and flow through our platform. Our ingestion process includes an adapter module framework that enables aiWARE to dynamically load data from external sources and repositories (i.e. Microsoft OneDrive, DropBox, Box, Google Drive, HTTP/RTSP/RTMP Streams, etc.) automatically. Our solution enables external developers to write these adapters to extend the platform to be able to ingest additional data sources. We plan to continue to expand our current collection of adapters to enable the capture of an increasingly diverse array of data types and formats, whether industry-standard or proprietary, over time.

Cognitive Engine Ecosystem 
 Our platform includes an open ecosystem that allows third-party developers to easily integrate additional cognitive engines within our platform, which makes our solution readily scalable for a broad range of processes and vertical markets. We continually seek to add new cognitive engines in a variety of categories to ensure that users can access a broad selection of capabilities from multiple vendors across many classes of cognition, all of which can be accessed via a simple, easy-to-use and tightly integrated platform. Our goal is to create a broad ecosystem, eventually offering all major cognitive engine capabilities through a single open and integrated platform. We believe that our aiWARE platform incorporates more cognitive engines, across more classes of cognition, than any competitive offering. 
 Our innovative AI ecosystem currently incorporates over 180 cognitive engines of various classes and types from multiple third-party vendors, including Google, IBM, Microsoft, Nuance, Amazon and HPE, among others, in addition to several of our own proprietary cognitive engines. These cognitive engines use advanced algorithms to capture and extract data from media files for a variety of cognitive capabilities, including transcription, face detection, face recognition, object detection, object recognition, sentiment analysis, language translation, audio/video fingerprinting, geolocation, visual moderation, optical character recognition, logo recognition, metadata extraction, and media format transcoding. By having a number of engines from different providers within the same class, we are able to benchmark the engines to identify the optimal engine for a users needs and in some cases use them together to provide better overall accuracy than any single engine can achieve. 
 Conductor Technology 
 We have, and are developing, proprietary Conductor technology to analyze source data files and intelligently route them to the most appropriate cognitive engine(s) within a cognitive class to improve the performance, cost and speed of the data analysis process, enabling users to achieve higher accuracy and derive more robust intelligence from their media. For example, our Conductor for speech-to-text transcription uses multiple machine learning algorithms, including deep learning neural networks, to train, test and validate datasets to predict the best transcription engine for the users specific media, and in some cases to select and employ multiple engines, to maximize the accuracy of the transcription results. This capability enables our platform to produce higher transcription accuracy than any single engine solution. We plan to expand this capability to other cognitive classes using the same underling methodology. 
 We are in the process of incorporating the proprietary machine learning technology that we acquired from Atigeo Corporation into our aiWARE platform to further advance the intelligent orchestration of our Conductor technology. We believe that, in the future, the application of our proprietary inter-class Conductor technology will enable our aiWARE platform to derive contextual meaning from one cognitive class, such as object recognition, and apply this context and understanding to other classes of cognition, including transcription and facial recognition. We consider our Conductor technology to be a key competitive advantage for Veritone, and we have filed patent applications covering various aspects of this technology. 
 Temporal Elastic Database 
 Once media has been processed on our aiWARE platform, we store the results of the cognitive engine processing in a searchable, time-correlated temporal elastic database, or TED. Utilizing this proprietary database, we have the unique ability to synthesize various disparate cognitive data in a cohesive, time-based format, allowing users to access multivariate intelligence previously unattainable from their media. We can dissect and analyze any of the media files and metadata therein, producing a multi-dimensional index for ease of search, discovery and analytics. TED provides immediate access to processed media through a dynamic multivariate toolset that enables queries of all elements within, around and derived from the media. Elements include, but are not limited to, cognitive engine outputs (transcripts, translations, recognized objects and faces, etc.), file metadata, structured data sets, and user-associated metadata such as content template outputs and freeform tags. 
 
4 
 
TEDs architecture leverages several commercial, open source, distributed and non-relational databases with proven scalability and performance characteristics. While storage agnostic, TED currently runs on Elasticsearch, leveraging the Apache Lucerne inverted index architecture. 
 Core Applications 
 We have developed a suite of native applications that comprise the base level services of our aiWARE platform and enable users to ingest and manage media files within our platform, run cognitive processes against their media files, access and find the data they need, share media internally or externally, develop libraries of reference training data, review any chosen media file or clip, and analyze the resulting attributes of any media file processed by its cognitive features. Our core applications include the following: 

 | Admin. Veritone Admin is an application that enables our users to manage their account settings, users, access and features within an account.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | CMS. Veritone Content Management System, or CMS, is a hosted application that enables our users to ingest, process and search their media. The CMS application provides a common workflow for adding media sources, such as various cloud drive providers (DropBox, Box, Google Drive), stream protocols (HTTP, RTMP, RTSP) and others by adding the sources to CMS through ingestion adapters. Furthermore, cognitive workflows can be assigned to media sources, allowing the automated and customized processing of media from each distinct media source. Once media has been ingested into the CMS system, the media can be managed, reviewed, edited and further processed by cognitive engines within the application.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Discovery. Veritone Discovery is an application within our platform that allows users to create and execute direct searches against cognitive engine output, either through predefined queries called Watchlists, or via ad-hoc searches. Once a user has generated a search result from a Watchlist or ad-hoc search, they are able to take several permission-controlled actions. These actions include viewing the media snippet, downloading the snippet, editing the cognitive engine metadata, verifying content in the search results and sharing the search results and associated media clips individually or including them as part of a Collection.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Collections. Veritone Collections is an application within our platform that presents groupings of search results or Watchlists in shareable units called Collections. A Collection of search results can be titled and described, then shared externally, via email, link or embedded widget. Users can edit the search results within a Collection from the application before sharing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Library. Veritone Library is an application within our platform that enables users to create libraries of reference training data such as known faces, objects, or audio files. Engines can then be trained against specific private or public libraries to facilitate specialized engine processing for recognition or fingerprinting.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The modular structure of our AI platform enables rapid development of applications that convert customer data into actionable insights that are relevant to the specific needs of different markets. We have successfully created and demonstrated several use cases for our media, law enforcement, politics and legal applications, which enable customers to solve difficult problems such as programmatic ad verification and tracking of audience measurement correlations, transcribing and translating recorded telephone calls in multiple languages, and finding, selecting and editing long form-media content into short-form media shareable on social media. 
 Veritone Developer Application 
 We recently launched our Veritone Developer application, a self-service development environment that empowers developers to create, submit and deploy cognitive engines and/or user applications directly into the aiWARE architecture. Veritone Developer enables cognitive engine developers to access our APIs and developer 
 
5 
 
 toolkits to rapidly integrate their engines onto our aiWARE platform, and enables application developers to access our APIs and developer toolkits to develop new public or private applications utilizing the metadata produced by our aiWARE platform. This provides developers with a self-service mechanism to build on top of the core Veritone architecture to satisfy specific use cases, or to create software products that can be distributed to Veritones user base as an extension of our core aiWARE offerings. In the first half of 2018, we intend to launch our AI Marketplace, which will enable end users to purchase licenses to third-party developers public applications in conjunction with their use of our platform and core applications. 
 Deployment Models 
 Our aiWARE platform is deployable on any commercially available cloud instance, virtually anywhere in the world. It currently resides on Amazon Web Services (AWS) commercial cloud in the United States and in the United Kingdom. We plan to deploy our platform on a variety of cloud infrastructures across varying geographic regions in the future as we expand our business internationally. 
 Our platform is run and executed within a containerized architecture that is inherently secure, and all transport of data is encrypted in accordance with industry best practices. Our multi-tenant architecture enables all of our customers to utilize our platform while securely partitioning their application usage and data. This enables our customers to benefit from rapid computing, reduced costs, and economies of scale that are inherent in cloud-based computing environments. 
 We also offer secure, government cloud deployments of our platform within Microsoft Azures and AWS secure government clouds, to support government and public safety related customers. We are currently pursuing CJIS (Criminal Justice Information Services division of the FBI) compliance and FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) certification for our cloud-based platform. We plan to continue to follow industry best practices that govern access to our platform to ensure that private media remains behind appropriate firewalls. 
 In addition to our cloud-based version of aiWARE, we recently launched a hybrid on-premises/cloud version of the platform that allows users to conduct cognitive processing using certain engines on a network-isolated basis behind the users firewall, so that only the metadata produced by those engines needs to be moved outside of the users network. Users may elect to conduct processing utilizing additional cloud-based engines and to utilize our cloud-based suite of applications to search and analyze the results. This version of aiWARE is ideal for users who want their original content to remain on their secure network for security or transmission cost reasons. 
 We are currently developing a version of aiWARE that will provide users with substantially all of the features and functionality of our cloud-based platform (including TED and our core suite of applications) in a fully network-isolated, on-premises environment. The cognitive engines available through our on-premises deployment of aiWARE will initially represent a subset of the engines available in our cloud-based deployment; however, we are working with our cognitive engine partners to expand the classes and numbers of cognitive engines available for processing on a network-isolated basis. 
 Media Agency Business 
 Our founders are pioneers in digital advertising and leaders in the industry, who founded several high-profile businesses in the media industry including AdForce (acquired by CMGi), 2CAN Media (acquired by CMGi) and dMarc Broadcasting (acquired by Google). At the time Veritone was founded in 2014, we acquired a full service media advertising agency, which is now our wholly-owned subsidiary, Veritone One, Inc., or Veritone One. Veritone One creates and places native and traditional advertising and specializes in host-endorsed and influencer advertising, providing outstanding service, technology and performance. Our services include media planning and strategy, media buying and placement, campaign messaging, clearance verification and 
 
6 
 
 attribution, and custom analytics. In 2017, we placed approximately $114 million in media advertising for our advertising clients, which included The Upside Travel Company, LLC, Uber Technologies, Inc., SimpliSafe, Inc., 1-800 flowers.com, Inc., Dollar Shave Club, Inc., DraftKings, Inc., Casper Sleep, Inc., Tommy John, Inc., and others. 
 We initially used our platform to help our advertisers improve their media placements and maximize the return on their advertising spending using real-time ad verification and media analytics. Using our platform, we can manage, deliver, optimize, verify and quantify native and spot-based advertising campaigns and content distribution for our clients across multiple channels, including broadcast radio, satellite audio, streaming audio, broadcast and cable television, digital video services such as YouTube, and podcasting. Although we intend to focus on our AI platform business, we plan to continue to provide advertising placement services. 
Target Markets 
 Media and Entertainment 
 We commenced commercial SaaS licensing of our AI platform in April 2015 with an initial focus on the Media market, to provide media owners and broadcasters with visibility on ad placements and the effectiveness of their media campaigns. We license access to our platform via a SaaS model directly to such media owners and broadcasters, which include, but are not limited to, radio and television stations, advertising agencies, advertisers, sports and entertainment properties and networks. In addition, our SaaS customers use our solutions to automatically index and organize their audio and video content so that they can search, discover and analyze their media for programming and optimization across their broadcasts, streams, websites, podcasts and social media channels. We also license access to our Veritone Public Media Index to broadcasters, media owners and other advertising agencies. 
 For broadcasters and media owners, we generally take the actual audio and/or video feeds directly from the customer and ingest them into our platform. Next, the media is run through various cognitive engines such as transcription and logo detection, enabling the resulting metadata to be searchable and actionable. Our customers can index their content down to the second or frame, to provide near real-time ad verification, content segmentation and integrated audience analytics. Our platform allows our customers to optimize their advertising spending across various media channels with near real-time ad verification and integrated audience analysis. Broadcasters and other media customers can also create new short-form and on-demand products to extend customer engagement, search and discovery and monetization. In addition, based on learning generated by our cognitive engines, these media customers can efficiently create new programmatic content, tailored towards specific users. 
Legal and Compliance 
 Within the Legal market, we are focused initially on eDiscovery, where audio and video content analysis is playing an increasingly important role in litigation. The eDiscovery segment includes a broad range of software and managed service providers with strong existing capabilities for identifying, collecting and producing electronically stored information, or ESI, primarily from text-based documents, including email. Historically, eDiscovery processing has disregarded audio and video files due to the high cost and complexity involved in automatically identifying relevant keywords, phrases or other details contained therein. Today, legal professionals must deal with escalating volumes of audio and video content resulting from recorded telephone calls, voice mails, video recordings and other sources. 
 Our SaaS solution leverages AI and the scale of the cloud, combined with our broad cognitive engine ecosystem, to enable professionals to quickly search and analyze audio, video and structured data to identify particular words, phrases, sentiments and voices at a fraction of the cost of other legal eDiscovery solutions. Our platform provides an easy to use and cost-effective solution for storing, organizing and analyzing evidentiary 
 
7 
 
 media to help legal professionals quickly find the critical details necessary to win their cases, and to dramatically increase the efficiency of their eDiscovery processes for audio and video files. We have integrated our platform with Relativity, an industry leading eDiscovery software platform, enabling Relativity users to leverage our AI capabilities to perform large-scale, automated analytics of audio and video files within the Relativity environment as part of their e-discovery efforts. We have entered into agreements with major providers of eDiscovery services and solutions and multinational law firms, pursuant to which they are using our platform to analyze the vast amounts of audio and video data evidence in current litigation, which was previously too expensive to access and use effectively. 
 We have also identified a need of customers in a broad range of industries, such as the financial services, insurance, healthcare and other highly-regulated industries, to utilize AI technology to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of their compliance efforts. For example, our AI platform could be leveraged by users in these industries to monitor recorded audio communications to identify compliance issues such as improper securities or financial product sales practices or off-label marketing of pharmaceuticals, in near real time. We are currently pursuing opportunities with major financial institutions, and outsourced call monitoring providers serving these customers, which would use our platform to process monitored audio recordings to identify regulatory or policy violations or other suspicious behavior. 
 Government 
 We have recently deployed our platform on Microsoft Azures and AWS secure government clouds, to enable law enforcement agencies and other government authorities to organize and gain insight from the large amount of audio, video and structured data they accumulate on a daily basis, including from police body cameras, police car recorders, interview room cameras, 911 audio tapes, surveillance cameras and a variety of other digital media technologies. As the volume of video data collected has grown enormously in recent years, so has the challenge of reviewing that data to assist in investigations. In most cases, due to the unstructured nature of this video data, it currently must be reviewed manually, a task that consumes huge amounts of time and causes delays in investigations. For example, the BBC reported that it took the police four months to investigate 200,000 hours of surveillance camera footage to identify suspects from the London riots that occurred in 2011. As a result, such data largely has not been used other than as back up to protect police and government agencies from potential claims. In addition to the challenges of using the huge volumes of video footage being collected, authorities are also faced with the daunting task of responding to requests for such information from the public. Many states have statutes that require public agencies to provide certain information, including in many cases audio and video files, and several states have passed laws mandating that video content must be stored and accessible for a specified number of months. Reviewing video footage to identify and authenticate the appropriate footage to be disclosed is currently a time-consuming, largely manual process. As a result, law enforcement and other public safety agencies are continuing to invest in solutions in this area. 
 We are actively engaged in discussions with various police departments and certain related agencies to license our AI platform, and we have processed content for certain departments on a trial basis to validate their use cases. We believe that our platform will enable police and other government agencies to organize, store, manage and access the huge amounts of audio and video data they are collecting from multiple disparate sources much more efficiently and effectively to assist in investigations, gain insights on their operations, improve service and training and identify issues, as well as to more quickly and efficiently respond to public records requests for such data. 
 Politics 
 In the Politics market, our platform enables political organizations such as campaigns, political consultants, elected officials, committees, political action committees, or PACs, Super PACs and special interest groups to analyze public and private media, conduct research and provide access to previously inaccessible data. The historical dominance of the big four national broadcast networks has splintered into thousands of blogs, video 
 
8 
 
 sites, and social channels with around-the-clock coverage of candidates and issues, significantly increasing the challenge of monitoring media coverage and voter sentiment. Our platform can transform multiple media sources (broadcast radio, TV, digital video services, podcasts and customers own media such as stump speeches and tracker videos) using multiple cognitive engines to provide previously untapped resources of critical information that can be easily searched and acted upon in near real-time. Users can also ingest and analyze structured data, such as voter registration data and donor databases, in correlation with the processed data. Our solution, which includes the Veritone Public Media Index, gives political operatives tools to quickly identify a candidates positions on key issues, identify flip-flopping or inconsistencies, monitor media coverage of issues and trending topics, and understand local voter sentiment. Our platform can be used throughout the life cycle of a political organization, from exploring a candidacy and fundraising, to shaping a narrative and communicating with voters. 
 Other Vertical Markets and Applications 
 The open architecture, modularity and power of our AI platform make it easy to scale and adapt our solutions to a variety of other vertical markets without significant cost or integration requirements. We are currently developing industry-specific solutions for a broad range of customers to enable them to leverage our platform to analyze public and private audio, video and structured data. The initial other vertical markets that we are planning to pursue include commercial security and retail. 
 We believe the opportunity for our platform in these markets is driven by the industrys migration from analog, on-premise security solutions to VSaaSVideo Surveillance-as-a-Service, which is a web-hosted, wireless security system that allows users to remotely store, manage, record, play and monitor surveillance footageentirely in the cloud. The footage is not stored on-site, and users do not need recording software, only an IP camera system, an Internet connection and a VSaaS provider. VSaaS is a remote approach to video surveillance systems, as opposed to an on-site video security system. With VSaaS, IP cameras are installed at the desired location and then stream security footage to the providers site. Since VSaaS is managed in the cloud, users can access footage or cameras from anywhere at any time through a desktop, laptop or mobile device. We believe that the commercial security and retail markets can benefit from being able to access and utilize intelligence embedded in audio, video and structured data captured by a variety of sources from closed-circuit television cameras in public spaces, to video surveillance data collected from security cameras and in-store video cameras installed in most major retailers. All of these sources are collecting petabytes of information that can be ingested for analysis, archiving, search and discovery, using machine learning predictive and analytics software. We believe our platform can be easily modified to address these other vertical markets. 
Sales and Marketing 
 As of February 28, 2018, we had 89 sales and marketing employees. The sales and marketing activities of our AI platform business are focused on driving awareness and increasing brand recognition of our platform and technologies across our core vertical markets, gaining new customers and increasing revenue from our existing customers. In our media agency business, we continue to focus our sales efforts on expanding business with our existing advertising clients and gaining new clients. 
AI Platform Business 
 We currently conduct sales and marketing activities related to our AI platform offerings through a combination of our direct sales force and indirect channel partners such as value-added resellers (VARs) and referral partners. Our direct sales organization is comprised of teams of sales representatives, account executives and sales managers, who are supported by sales development representatives, sales engineers and other inside sales and customer support personnel. These sales teams are organized based on their specialized knowledge and expertise within each of our target markets. In addition to targeting new customers, our direct sales team is responsible for driving renewals of existing subscriptions as well as increased adoption of our platform by existing and new customers. Our direct sales teams are currently located in the United States and the United Kingdom. 
 
9 
 
In addition, we have recently formed a strategic accounts group, comprised of business development and sales managers who are focused on identifying, developing and managing our relationships with strategic accounts, including end customers, technology and go-to-market partners, across all of our target markets. This group is pursuing opportunities with strategic accounts including global systems development and integration providers, managed services providers, government solutions providers, and major media and entertainment properties and networks. Our strategic accounts group collaborates closely with our product management, product development and data science teams to evaluate and develop solutions to address the needs of these strategic accounts. 
 We have also established, and we intend to continue to expand, an indirect sales channel comprised of VARs, distributors and referral partners. We have entered into agreements with channel partners located in the United States, as well as in Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. These agreements generally provide the channel partners with discounts below our standard prices for platform licenses, processing and other services, have terms of one year which automatically renew on an annual basis, and are generally terminable by either party for convenience following a specified notice period. Substantially all of our agreements with channel partners are nonexclusive; however, we allow channel partners to register sales opportunities through our deal registration program, in which case we may grant a channel partner priority to pursue an opportunity for a specified period of time, subject to certain conditions. 
 In April 2017, we entered into an agreement with Quantum, Inc. (Quantum,) a leading provider of scaled enterprise storage solutions, to integrate our platform onto Quantums storage products. In August 2017, Quantum began shipping storage products to customers with our hybrid on-premises/cloud version of aiWARE installed. Quantum markets and sells its storage products directly and indirectly through an extensive network of distributors and resellers. We have entered into agreements with a number of these resellers, to enable them to market and sell cognitive processing services in conjunction with aiWARE installed on the Quantum storage products, as well as our cloud-based aiWARE offerings. 
 We intend to expand our direct and indirect sales channels in the United States and internationally in order to aggressively pursue wider recognition for our technology and capabilities, and to drive greater market penetration in our key target markets.
 From a marketing perspective, we are focused on increasing our brand name recognition within each of our target markets, and have engaged a third party public relations firm to assist in this process. Our marketing efforts include providing media support to our direct sales force, as well as trade advertising and trade show outreach. Our marketing efforts also include a branding and digital campaign strategy designed to reach both market influencers and the media. 
 Media Agency Business 
 We market and sell our advertising services through a combination of our direct sales and indirect channel sales. We primarily market and sell directly to advertisers through outbound sales networking and client and partner referrals. Our indirect sales channel consists of referral partners who are mainly advertising agencies or marketing consultants who are unable to provide certain services to their clients, such as radio, Podcast and YouTube placements. In addition to our sales efforts for new clients, we further expand sales opportunities and upsell through our campaign strategists who work directly with our advertising clients to optimize and enhance media spending on advertising campaigns. We plan to continue to expand our domestic sales footprint through the addition of direct sales representatives and campaign strategists.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are in the early stages of developing our AI platform business and, as such, a limited number of customers, primarily in the Media market, account for a significant portion of the revenues that we have generated from this business. During 2017, two national radio broadcasting customers accounted for approximately 45% of our total revenues from our AI platform business; however, no single customer of our AI platform business represented a material portion of our consolidated revenues. As we expand our AI platform business both within the Media market and across our other vertical markets, we believe that our dependence on any single customer or group of customers will be minimized. 
 In our media agency business, we target customers that make significant investments in advertising, particularly in native and spot-based advertising campaigns delivered over broadcast radio, satellite audio, streaming audio, digital video services and other social media channels and podcasting. During 2017, ten customers of our media agency accounted for approximately 67% of our total revenues from this business. Revenues from two of these media agency customers, The Upside Travel Company, LLC and Uber Technologies, Inc., represented approximately 14% and 10% of our consolidated net revenues, respectively. 
 We believe that our relationships with our key customers in both our AI platform business and our media agency business are good. However, if our key customers discontinue or reduce their business with us, or suffer downturns in their businesses, it could have a significant negative impact on our financial results on a short-term basis. If we lose business from key customers and we are unable to sufficiently expand our customer base to replace the lost business, it would have a long-term negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Competition 
 The market for AI-enabled solutions is rapidly evolving and highly competitive, with new capabilities and solutions introduced by both large established players such as IBM, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce seeking to harness the power of AI across multiple vertical markets or enterprise functions, as well as smaller emerging companies developing point solutions that generally only address a single cognitive category or a specific industry segment. 
 AI Platform Business. We believe the following competitive attributes are necessary for our AI platform offering to successfully compete in the AI industry for corporate, institutional and government customers: 

 | Breadth and depth of cognitive capabilities;
--+---------------------------------------------


 | Ability to seamlessly utilize multiple cognitive engines in the same and different classes;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
11 
 

 | Performance of cognitive engines, particularly accuracy and speed;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Applications to enable the platform to be effectively leveraged for a wide variety of use cases;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Availability of cloud-based and on-premises deployment models and functionality;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Ease of deployment and integration;
--+------------------------------------


 | Platform scalability, reliability and security;
--+------------------------------------------------


 | Ability to deploy state-of-the art AI capabilities;
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | Customer support;
--+------------------


 | Strength of sales and marketing efforts; and
--+---------------------------------------------


 | Cost of deploying and using our products.
--+------------------------------------------

 We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of the factors listed above. We believe that few of our competitors currently compete directly with us across all of our cognitive capabilities and vertical markets, and that none of our competitors currently deploy an AI operating system with an open ecosystem comprised of a comparable number of multiple third party cognitive engines that can be accessed by customers from a single integrated platform. 
 Our competitors fall into five primary categories: 
 

 | Infrastructure-based cloud computing vendors offering cognitive APIs, such as IBM Watson via Bluemix, Microsoft Cognitive Services via Azure and Amazon Machine Learning via AWS; typically, these solutions provide raw computing and storage solutions in conjunction with cognitive categories such as translation, transcription and object detection from which customers can build their own solutions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Large established media services companies with global advertising reach that are also deploying new media analytics technologies to best service the needs of major brands; these include the major ad agencies and their affiliates;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Smaller AI-focused vendors offering solutions within a single cognitive category such as Clarifai (object detection), VoiceBase (natural language processing) or Gracenote (audio fingerprinting);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Data management and/or analytics vendors that offer solutions that recognize patterns, anomalies, and correlations from customer data sets, such as Alpine Data Labs, Alteryx, Angoss Software, Dell, FICO, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and SAS;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | System integrators that aggregate and integrate solutions from multiple underlying providers of cognitive services for clients, such as Accenture and Deloitte Consulting; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | SaaS software providers focused on a particular industry segment, such as eDiscovery, politics, digital asset management or law enforcement.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Many of the same potential competitors listed above participate in our AI ecosystem, enabling their services to be accessed by our customers through our platform. For example, we leverage cloud computing solutions and storage from Amazons AWS and Microsofts Azure, and also deploy and integrate cognitive engines from such vendors as IBM, Google, Microsoft, VoiceBase and Clarifai. Further, within our target vertical markets, we are collaborating with companies within the above categories, such as platform providers within eDiscovery. 
 Media Agency Business. Competitors of our advertising services are mainly traditional advertising agencies that are either large full-service agencies or smaller niche agencies with a particular specialization or focus, such as radio media placement. We believe that we currently are, and will continue to, compete successfully against our competitors on several key factors. We are a leader in endorsed radio advertising services and expect to be 
 
12 
 
 able to command more of our clients advertising budgets as we expand our media services further within digital and television. In addition, we leverage our platform to provide our clients with innovative technology that we believe provides them with better analytics and insights into their advertising campaigns than our competitors for better advertising performance and optimization. Lastly, due to our reputation and strength within the industry, we have exclusive relationships with most of our advertising clients for audio related media placement. 
 Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets and larger intellectual property portfolios. As a result, certain of our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. In addition, some competitors may offer products or services that address one or a limited number of functions at lower prices, with greater depth than our products or geographies where we do not operate. With the introduction of new products and services and new market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. Moreover, as we expand the scope of our platform, we may face additional competition. 
 Research and Development 
 As of February 28, 2018, our research and development organization consisted of 66 employees, who are responsible for the design, development, testing and certification of our platform. The team is comprised of dedicated research employees, software engineers, quality engineers, data scientists, data engineers, site operations engineers, mobile app developers, product managers and user experience designers. We focus our efforts on developing new features and expanding the core technologies that further enhance the usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of our platform, as well as allow us to operate in new vertical markets. In addition, we contract with select third-party engineering services to support development and quality assurance testing. 
 Our research and development expenses were approximately $14.0 million and $7.9 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We plan to continue to invest in building new software capabilities and extending our platform to bring the power of contextual communications to a broader range of applications, with expanded functionality and capabilities. In 2017, we added over 100 cognitive engines to our platform and are planning to expand our Conductor technology capabilities to work with additional classes of cognitive engines. We also plan to further expand the feature sets of our platform for specific markets and enhance our overall capabilities. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. 
 As of February 28, 2018, in the United States, we had 18 issued patents, which expire between 2027 and 2031, and had 38 patent applications pending for examination. As of such date, we also had 12 issued patents and 46 patent applications pending for examination in foreign jurisdictions (including international PCT applications), all of which are related to our U.S. patents and patent applications. In addition, as of February 28, 2018, we had five registered trademarks in the United States, and we have filed applications to register several additional marks. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by implementing a policy that requires our employees and independent contractors involved in development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law. 
 Despite our efforts to protect our technology and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and other contractual protections, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and other technology. In addition, we intend to continue to expand our international operations, and 
 
13 
 
 effective intellectual property, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Further, companies in the communications and technology industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently threaten litigation, or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We may face allegations in the future that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. 
 Regulatory Environment 
 We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection and other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. Because global laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation. 
Employees 
 As of February 28, 2018, we had a total of 219 employees, all of which were full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
