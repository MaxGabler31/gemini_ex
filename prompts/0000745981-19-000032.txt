ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

The Company was incorporated in 1984 as a Louisiana corporation and is a registered bank holding company headquartered in Lafayette, Louisiana.  Its operations have been conducted primarily through its wholly owned bank subsidiary MidSouth Bank, N.A.  The Bank, a national banking association, was chartered and commenced operations in 1985.  As of December 31, 2018, the Bank operated through a network of 42 offices located in Louisiana and Texas.

Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to “the Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or similar references, mean MidSouth Bancorp, Inc. and our subsidiaries, including our banking subsidiary, MidSouth Bank, N.A., on a consolidated basis.  References to “MidSouth Bank” or the “Bank” mean our wholly owned banking subsidiary, MidSouth Bank, N.A.

Products and Services

The Bank is community oriented and focuses primarily on offering commercial and consumer loan and deposit services to small and middle market businesses, their owners and employees, and other individuals in our markets.  Our community banking philosophy emphasizes personalized service and building broad customer relationships.  Deposit products and services offered by the Bank include interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing checking accounts, investment accounts, cash management services, and electronic banking services, including remote deposit capture services, internet banking, and debit and credit cards.  Most of the Bank’s deposit accounts are FDIC-insured up to the maximum allowed, and the Bank customers have access to a world-wide ATM network of more than 55,000 surcharge-free ATMs.

Loans offered by the Bank include commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans (both owner-occupied and non-owner occupied), other loans secured by real estate and consumer loans.  

We are committed to an exceptional level of customer care.  We maintain our own in-house call center so that customers enjoy live interaction with employees of the Bank rather than an automated telephone system.  Additionally, we provide our employees with the training and technological tools to improve customer care.  We also conduct focus groups within the communities we serve and strive to create a two-way dialog to ensure that we are offering the banking products and services that our customers and communities need.

Markets

We operate in Louisiana and central and east Texas along the Interstate 10, Interstate 49, Highway 90, Interstate 45, Interstate 20 and Interstate 35 corridors.  As of December 31, 2018, our market area in Louisiana included 32 offices and is bound by Lafourche Parish to the south, East Baton Rouge Parish to the east, Caddo Parish to the north and Calcasieu Parish to the west.  Our market areas in Texas include 10 offices located in Beaumont, College Station, Conroe, Dallas, Greenville, Houston, Mesquite, Rockwall, and Tyler. For additional information regarding our properties, see Item 2 – Properties of this Report.
Oil and gas is the key industry within our markets.  However, medical, technology and research companies continue to develop within these markets thereby diversifying the economy.  Additionally, numerous major universities located within our market areas, including Louisiana State University, University of Houston, Rice University, Texas A&M University and University of Louisiana at Lafayette, provide a substantial number of jobs and help to contribute to the educated work force within our markets.

Competition

We face strong competition in our market areas from both traditional and nontraditional financial services providers, such as commercial banks; savings banks; credit unions; finance companies; mortgage, leasing, and insurance companies; money market mutual funds; brokerage houses; and branches that provide credit facilities.  Several of the financial services competitors in our market areas are substantially larger and have far greater resources; however, we have effectively competed by building long-term customer relationships.  Customer loyalty has been built through our continued focus on quality customer care enhanced by technology and effective delivery systems.

Other factors, including economic, legislative, and technological changes, also impact our competitive environment.  Management continually evaluates competitive challenges in the financial services industry and develops appropriate responses consistent with our overall market strategy.

Employees

As of December 31, 2018, the Bank employed approximately 474 full-time equivalent employees.  The Company had no employees who are not also employees of the Bank.  Through the Bank, employees receive customary employee benefits, which include an employee stock ownership plan; a 401(K) plan; and life, health and disability insurance plans.  Our directors, officers, and employees are important to the success of the Company and play a key role in business development by actively participating in the communities served by the Company.  The Company’s employees are not represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Management believes that its employee relations are good.

Copies of these filings may also be obtained free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
Supervision and Regulation

Under Federal Reserve policy, we are expected to act as a source of financial strength for, and to commit resources to support, the Bank.  This support may be required at times when, absent such Federal Reserve policy, we may not be inclined to provide such support.  In addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its banking subsidiaries are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks.  In the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by a bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a banking subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
Regulatory Matters
On December 27, 2017, the Company was informed in writing by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (“FRB Atlanta”) that the FRB Atlanta has determined that the Company is in “troubled condition” for purposes of Section 225.71 of Regulation Y. Based on the troubled condition determination, the Company (1) must notify the FRB Atlanta prior to adding or replacing a member of its board of directors or employing, or changing the responsibilities of, any senior executive officer, and (2) may not, except under certain circumstances, enter into any agreements to make severance or indemnification payments or make any such payments to “institution-affiliated parties” as defined in the regulations. 
On June 8, 2017, the Bank was informed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) that the OCC has determined that the Bank is in “troubled condition” for purposes of 12 C.F.R. 5.51, Changes in Directors and Senior Executive Officers, which implements the provisions of Section 914 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, 12 U.S.C. 1831i, and, as a result, the Bank is subject to specified restrictions on its operations. The OCC’s determination was based on deficiencies identified in its examination of the Bank, including but not limited to deficiencies in asset quality, credit administration and strategic planning. Based on the troubled condition determination, the Bank is now subject to the following restrictions on its operations:  (1) the Bank must seek approval from the OCC prior to adding or replacing a member of its board of directors, or employing, or changing the responsibilities of any senior executive officer, and (2) the Bank may not, except 
- 8 -

under certain circumstances, enter into any agreements to make severance or indemnification payments or make any such payments to “institution-affiliated parties” as defined in the regulations.
On July 19, 2017, the Bank entered into a formal written agreement with the OCC that provides, among other things, that the Bank: (i) create a committee to monitor the Bank’s compliance with the Agreement and make quarterly reports to the Board of Directors and the OCC; (ii) adopt and implement a three-year strategic plan for the Bank consistent with regulatory guidance and to be reviewed and updated on at least an annual basis by the Board of Directors; (iii) protect its interests in its criticized assets (those assets classified as “doubtful,” “substandard,” or “special mention” by internal or external loan review or examination), and adopt and implement a written program designed to eliminate the basis of criticism of criticized assets equal to or exceeding $250,000, which shall be reviewed and, as necessary, revised, on a quarterly basis; (iv) may not extend additional credit to any borrower with an aggregate outstanding loan balance of $250,000 that is a criticized asset unless approved and deemed by the Bank's Board of Directors to be necessary to promote the best interests of the Bank and will not compromise the Bank's written program with respect to such loans; (v) develop and implement a written program to improve the Bank's loan portfolio management and provide the Board of Directors with written reports on the Bank's loan portfolio to enhance problem loan identification; (vi) review and, as necessary, revise the Bank's loan review program to ensure the timely identification and categorization of problem credits consistent with regulatory guidance; (vii) adopt and implement certain enhancements to its policies and procedures relating to its ALLL and the methodology related thereto; and (viii) revise its internal audit program to ensure Bank adherence to an independent and comprehensive internal audit program.
On October 25, 2018, the Bank entered into a Stipulation to the Issuance of a Consent Order with the OCC, consenting to the issuance of a consent order (the “Consent Order”) relating to weaknesses in the Bank’s Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering (collectively “BSA”) compliance program. In consenting to the issuance of the Consent Order, the Bank did not admit or deny any charges of unsafe or unsound banking practices related to the BSA compliance program.
Under the terms of the Consent Order the Bank and/or its Board of Directors is required to take certain actions which include, but are not limited to: (1) creation of a subcommittee of the Board of Directors of the Bank to monitor and coordinate the Bank’s adherence to the provisions of the Consent Order; (2) appointment of a qualified BSA Officer; (3) assessment of the Bank’s personnel and training needs to ensure that an adequate number of qualified staff have been retained for the Bank’s BSA Department; (4) ensure the Bank’s adherence to a written program of policies and procedures to provide for BSA compliance and the appropriate identification and monitoring of transactions that pose greater than normal risk for BSA compliance; (5) development and implementation of a customer due diligence program to enhance customer due diligence and risk assessment processes; (6) revision of the Bank’s program for monitoring and reporting suspicious activity; and (7) implementation of a comprehensive training program for employees and directors to ensure their awareness of their responsibility for compliance with (a) the requirements of the BSA and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, (b) the Bank’s relevant policies, procedures, and processes, and (c) relevant examples of red flags for money laundering, terrorist financing, and suspicious activity. 
The Consent Order does not require the Bank to pay any civil money penalty or require additional capital. The Consent Order will remain in effect and be enforceable until it is modified, terminated, suspended or set aside by the OCC. Issuance of the Consent Order does not preclude further government action with respect to the Bank’s BSA program, including the imposition of fines, sanctions, additional expenses and compliance cost, and/or restrictions on the activities of the Bank. 
Regulatory Reform
The financial crisis of 2008, including the downturn of global economic, financial and money markets and the threat of collapse of numerous financial institutions, and other recent events have led to the adoption of numerous new laws and regulations that apply to, and focus on, financial institutions. The most significant of these new laws is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), which was adopted on July 21, 2010 and, in part, is intended to implement significant structural reforms to the financial services industry.
In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “EGRRCPA”) was enacted to reduce the regulatory burden on certain banking organizations, including community banks, by modifying or eliminating certain federal regulatory requirements. While the EGRRCPA maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion as well as for larger banks with assets above $50 billion. In addition, the EGRRCPA included regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, application of the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures, qualified mortgages, and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans. However, federal banking regulators retain broad discretion to impose additional regulatory requirements on banking organizations based on safety and soundness and U.S. financial system stability considerations.

The Company and the Bank continue to experience ongoing regulatory reform. These regulatory changes could have a significant effect on how the Company and the Bank conduct business. The specific implications of the Dodd-Frank Act, the EGRRCPA, and other potential regulatory reforms cannot yet be fully predicted and will depend to a large extent on the specific regulations that are to be adopted in the future. Certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and the EGRRCPA are discussed in more detail below.
Bank Holding Companies
Historically, the activities of bank holding companies were limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking. Bank holding companies were generally prohibited from acquiring control of any company that was not a bank and from engaging in any business other than the business of banking or managing and controlling banks. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which took effect on March 12, 2000, dismantled many Depression-era restrictions against affiliation between banking, securities and insurance firms by permitting bank holding companies to engage in a broader range of financial activities, so long as certain safeguards are observed. Specifically, bank holding companies may elect to become “financial holding companies” that may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity.

We elected to become a financial holding company in November 2012. However, related to the regulatory issues discussed above under “Regulatory Matters,” we decertified as a financial holding company in November 2017. We remain a bank holding company under the Federal Bank Holding Company Act. 

Dodd-Frank Act
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act implemented far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including changes that have affected all bank holding companies and banks, including us and the Bank, including the following provisions:


• | Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Dodd-Frank Act changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital. The Dodd-Frank Act also made permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance and increased the cash limit of Securities Investor Protection Corporation protection from $100,000 to $250,000. 


• | Payment of Interest on Demand Deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts. 


• | Creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act centralized significant aspects of consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), which is discussed in more detail below. 


• | Debit Card Interchange Fees. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to, among other things, require that debit card interchange fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction. In June 2011, the Federal Reserve Board adopted regulations setting the maximum permissible interchange fee as the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction, with an additional adjustment of up to one cent per transaction if the issuer implements additional fraud-prevention standards. Although issuers that have assets of less than $10 billion are exempt from the Federal Reserve Board’s regulations that set maximum interchange fees, these regulations could significantly impact the interchange fees that financial institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, are able to collect. 

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act implements other far-reaching changes to the financial regulatory landscape, including provisions that:

• | restrict the preemption of state law by federal law and disallow subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks from availing themselves of such preemption;


• | impose comprehensive regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market, subject to significant rulemaking processes, which would include certain provisions that would effectively prohibit insured depository institutions from conducting certain derivatives businesses in the institution itself;


• | require depository institutions with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion to conduct regular stress tests and require large, publicly traded bank holding companies to create a risk committee responsible for the oversight of enterprise risk management;


• | require loan originators to retain 5% of any loan sold or securitized, unless it is a “qualified residential mortgage,” subject to certain exceptions;

- 10 -


• | prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (the Volcker Rule); and


• | implement corporate governance revisions that apply to all public companies, not just financial institutions.

While much of the Dodd-Frank Act has been implemented in the form of final rules from the banking agencies, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations continues to be unclear. In addition, the current administration in the U.S. has added further uncertainty as to the implementation, scope and timing of additional rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act, and it is possible that existing rules may be modified or repealed. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain aspects of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to us and our investors, even if only in the short-term.
Capital Requirements
We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action (described below), we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies. Our capital amounts and classification are also subject to judgments by the regulators regarding qualitative components, risk weightings, and other factors. For further detail on capital and capital ratios, see the discussion under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Basel III Capital Framework

The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted rules to implement the Basel III capital framework as outlined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and standards for calculating risk-weighted assets and risk-based capital measurements (collectively, the “Basel III Final Rules”).  For purposes of these capital rules, (i) common equity Tier 1 capital (“CET1”) consists principally of common stock (including surplus) and retained earnings; (ii) Tier 1 capital consists principally of CET1 plus non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, and certain grandfathered cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities; and (iii) Tier 2 capital consists principally of Tier 1 capital plus qualifying subordinated debt and preferred stock, and limited amounts of an institution's allowance for loan losses.  Each regulatory capital classification is subject to certain adjustments and limitations, as implemented by the Basel III Final Rules.  The Basel III Final Rules also establish risk weightings that are applied to many classes of assets held by community banks, including, importantly, applying higher risk weightings to certain commercial real estate loans. The Company and the Bank are subject to the Basel III capital ratios.
The Basel III Final Rules were effective on January 1, 2015. The Basel III Final Rules' capital conservation buffer (as described below) became fully phased in effective January 1, 2019.  As a result, banks are required to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%), (iii) a minimum ratio of total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter).
The Basel III Final Rules provide deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital measures, and primarily to CET1, including deductions and adjustments that were not applied to reduce CET1 under historical regulatory capital rules.  For example, mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities must be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1.  These deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital are fully phased in as of January 1, 2019.
- 11 -

The Basel III Final Rules also implemented a “countercyclical capital buffer,” generally designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk. This buffer is a CET1 add-on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0% to 2.5% (potentially resulting in total buffers of between 2.5% and 5%).

This buffer is a CET1 add-on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0% to 2.5% (potentially resulting in total buffers of between 2.5% and 5%).
In addition, the OCC has established higher individual minimum capital ratios for the Bank. Specifically, the Bank must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 8%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 12%. 
At December 31, 2018, our CET1 to risk-weighted assets ratio was 12.20%, our Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 17.79% our Total Capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 19.04% and our Leverage Ratio was 11.45%. Since our total consolidated assets are below $15 billion, our $21.5 million aggregate principal amount of trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2011, are included in our Tier 1 and Total Capital calculations.
Community Bank Leverage Ratio
As a result of the EGRRCPA, the federal banking agencies were required to develop a Community Bank Leverage Ratio (the ratio of a bank’s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for banking organizations with assets of less than $10 billion, such as the Bank. On November 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies invited public comment on their proposal to establish the Community Bank Leverage Ratio framework. Under the proposal, a community banking organization would be eligible to elect the Community Bank Leverage Ratio framework if it has less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, limited amounts of certain assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a Community Bank Leverage Ratio greater than 9 percent. A qualifying community banking organization that has chosen the proposed framework would be automatically considered in compliance with the Basel III capital requirements and would be exempt from the complex Basel III risk-based capital calculations. Such a community banking organization would be considered to have met the capital ratio requirements to be “well capitalized” for the federal banking agencies’ Prompt Corrective Action rules provided it has a Community Bank Leverage Ratio greater than 9 percent. Because the proposal has not been finalized and a final rule has not been issued, it is difficult at this time to predict when or how this new capital ratio will ultimately be applied to community banking organizations or to predict the specific impacts of the final rule. 
The Volcker Rule
The Dodd-Frank Act required the federal bank regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds).  The statutory provision is commonly called the “Volcker Rule."  On December 10, 2013, the Federal Reserve and other federal agencies issued final rules to implement the Volcker Rule. In relevant part, these final rules would have prohibited banking entities from owning collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) backed by trust preferred securities ("TruPS"), effective July 21, 2015.  However, subsequent to these final rules the U.S. financial regulatory agencies issued an interim rule to exempt CDOs backed by TruPS from the Volker Rule and the final rule, provided that (a) the CDO was established prior to May 19, 2010, (b) the banking entity reasonably believes that the CDO’s offering proceeds were used to invest primarily in TruPS issued by banks with less than $15 billion in assets, and (iii) the banking entity acquired the CDO investment on or before December 10, 2013.  At December 31, 2018, we did not have any CDOs backed by TruPS.
The EGRRCPA exempted all banks with less than $10 billion in assets (including their holding companies and affiliates) from the Volcker Rule, provided that the institution has total trading assets and liabilities of five percent or less of total assets, subject to certain limited exceptions. In December 2018, the federal banking agencies invited public comment on a proposal to exclude community banks from the application of the Volcker Rule. The Company believes that its financial condition and its operations are not and will not be significantly affected by the Volcker Rule or amendments thereto, including regulations adopted pursuant to the EGRRCPA.
The Durbin Amendment
The Dodd-Frank Act included provisions which restrict interchange fees to those which are “reasonable and proportionate” for certain debit card issuers, and limit the ability of networks and issuers to restrict debit card transaction routing. This statutory provision is known as the “Durbin Amendment.”  The Federal Reserve issued final rules implementing the Durbin Amendment on June 29, 2011.  In the final rules, interchange fees for debit card transactions were capped at $0.21 plus five basis points in 
- 12 -

order to be eligible for a safe harbor such that the fee is conclusively determined to be reasonable and proportionate.  Another related rule also permits an additional $0.01 per transaction “fraud prevention adjustment” to the interchange fee if certain Federal Reserve standards are implemented, including an annual review of fraud prevention policies and procedures.  With respect to network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions, it is now required that all debit cards participate in at least two unaffiliated networks so that the transactions initiated using those debit cards will have at least two independent routing channels. While the interchange fee restrictions contained in the Durbin Amendment, and the rules promulgated thereunder, only apply to debit card issuers with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets, these regulations could significantly affect the interchange fees that financial institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, including the Bank, are able to collect.

Prompt Corrective Action
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) established a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions.  Under this system, the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) and are required to take certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories.  The severity of the action will depend upon the capital category in which the institution is placed.  Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized.  The federal banking agencies have set the relevant capital level for each category.

An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal regulatory agency.  A bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution meets its capital restoration plan, subject to certain limitations.  The controlling holding company's obligation to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of 5.0% of an undercapitalized subsidiary's assets or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements.  An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with FDIC approval.  In addition, the appropriate federal regulatory agency may treat an undercapitalized institution in the same manner as it treats a significantly undercapitalized institution if it determines that those actions are necessary.

At December 31, 2018, the Bank had the requisite capital level to qualify as “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.

Insurance of Accounts and FDIC Insurance Assessments
The Bank’s deposits are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) of the FDIC up to the standard maximum insurance amount for each deposit insurance ownership category. Since January 1, 2013, the basic limit on FDIC deposit insurance coverage has been $250,000 per depositor. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC, subject to administrative and potential judicial hearing and review processes.
The DIF is funded by assessments on banks and other depository institutions. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, in February 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule that changed the assessment base for DIF assessments from domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity (defined as Tier 1 capital). In addition, as also required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted a new large-bank pricing assessment scheme, set a current target “designated reserve ratio” (described in more detail below) of 2% for the DIF, and established a lower assessment rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 1.15% and, in lieu of dividends, provides for a lower assessment rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 2% and 2.5%.

An institution’s assessment rate depends upon the institution’s assigned risk category, which is based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. Initial base assessment rates ranged from 2.5 to 45 basis points. The FDIC may make the following further adjustments to an institution’s initial base assessment rates: decreases for long-term unsecured debt, including most senior unsecured debt and subordinated debt; increases for holding long-term unsecured debt or subordinated debt issued by other insured depository institutions; and increases for broker deposits in excess of 10% of domestic deposits for insurances not well rated and well capitalized.  As of December 31, 2018, our risk category required a quarterly payment of approximately 8.87 basis points per $100 of assessable deposits.

- 13 -

The Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the FDIC increased discretion with regard to managing the required amount of reserves for the DIF, or the “designated reserve ratio.” Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act (i) raised the minimum designated reserve ratio to 1.35 % and removed the upper limit on the designated reserve ratio, (ii) requires that the reserve ratio reach 1.35 % by September 2020, and (iii) requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion of raising the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% which requirement was met by rules adopted by the FDIC during 2016. On June 30, 2016, the reserve ratio rose to 1.17%, which triggered three major changes to deposit insurance assessments beginning for the third quarter of 2016: (i) the range of initial assessment rates for all institutions declined from 5 to 35 basis points to 3 to 30 basis points (which are included in the total base assessment rates in the above paragraph); (ii) surcharges equal to an annual rate of 4.5 basis points began for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more; and (iii) the revised assessment method described above was implemented. The FDIA requires that the FDIC consider the appropriate level for the designated reserve ratio on at least an annual basis. 
The FDIC has adopted a DIF restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Banks with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets will receive credits to offset the portion of their assessments that help to raise the reserve ratio to 1.35%. When the reserve ratio is at or above 1.38%, the FDIC will automatically apply such a bank’s credits to reduce its regular DIF assessment up to the entire amount of the assessment. On September 30, 2018, the reserve ratio reached 1.36%. 
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
The Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (the “ALLL”) represents one of the most significant estimates in the Bank’s financial statements and regulatory reports.  Because of its significance, the Bank has established a system by which it develops, maintains, and documents a comprehensive, systematic, and consistently applied process for determining the amounts of the ALLL and the provision for loan and lease losses.  The Interagency Policy Statement on the ALLL encourages all banks and federal savings institutions to ensure controls are in place to consistently determine the ALLL in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, the federal savings association’s stated policies and procedures, management’s best judgment and relevant supervisory guidance.  The Bank’s estimate of credit losses reflects consideration of significant factors that affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date.
Safety and Soundness Standards
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended by the FDICIA and the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe standards, by regulations or guidelines, relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and compensation, fees and benefits, and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate.  The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted a set of guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards pursuant to FDICIA, as amended.  The guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation and fees and benefits.  In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines.  The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder.  In addition, the agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan.  If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of FDICIA.  See “Prompt Corrective Action” above.  If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.  The federal regulatory agencies also proposed guidelines for asset quality and earnings standards.
Community Reinvestment Act
Under the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA"), the Bank has an obligation to help meet the credit needs of the entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The CRA requires the appropriate federal regulator, in connection with its examination of an insured institution, to assess the institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications, such as applications for a merger or the establishment of a branch.  An unsatisfactory rating may be used as the basis for the denial of an application by the federal banking regulator.  The Bank received a satisfactory rating in its most recent CRA examination.

Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas 
The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (“FHLB-Dallas”), which is one of 12 regional FHLBs that provide funding to their members for making housing loans as well as for affordable housing and community development loans. Each FHLB serves as a reserve, or central bank, for the members within its assigned region. Each FHLB makes loans to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB. As a member, the Bank must purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB. At December 31, 2018, the Bank owned $3.5 million of FHLB stock.

Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates
We are subject to the provisions of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.  Section 23A places limits on: the amount of a bank’s loans or extensions of credit to affiliates; a bank’s investment in affiliates; assets a bank may purchase from affiliates, except for real and personal property exempted by the Federal Reserve; the amount of loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates; and a bank’s guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate.

The total permitted amount of the above transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10.0% of a bank’s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20.0% of a bank’s capital and surplus.  In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, each of the above transactions must also meet specified collateral requirements.  The Bank must also comply with other provisions designed to avoid the taking of low-quality assets.

We are also subject to the provisions of Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which, among other things, prohibit an institution from engaging in the above transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies.

The Dodd-Frank Act changed the definition of “covered transaction” in Sections 23A and 23B and limitations on asset purchases from insiders. With respect to the definition of “covered transaction,” the Dodd-Frank Act defines that term to include the acceptance of debt obligations issued by an affiliate as collateral for a bank’s loan or extension of credit to another person or company.  In addition, a “derivative transaction” with an affiliate is now deemed to be a “covered transaction” to the extent that such a transaction causes a bank or its subsidiary to have a credit exposure to the affiliate. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides that the Bank may not “purchase an asset from, or sell an asset to” a Bank insider (or their related interests) unless (1) the transaction is conducted on market terms, and (2) if the proposed transaction represents more than 10% of the capital stock and surplus of the Bank, it has been approved in advance by a majority of the Bank’s non-interested directors.

The Bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their related interests.  These extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.

Incentive Compensation
The Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have issued regulatory guidance (the “Incentive Compensation Guidance”) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Federal Reserve reviews, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” The findings are included in reports of examination, and deficiencies are incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization's safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the SEC and the federal bank regulatory agencies to establish joint regulations or guidelines that require financial institutions with assets of at least $1 billion to disclose the structure of their incentive compensation practices and prohibit such institutions from maintaining compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk-taking by providing excessive compensation, or that could lead to material financial loss to the financial institution.  The SEC and federal bank regulatory agencies re-proposed regulations in 2016 (initially proposed in 2011) and previously issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies, but have not yet finalized any regulations. If these or other regulations are adopted in a form

similar to that initially proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our executives. These proposed regulations incorporate the three principles discussed in the Incentive Compensation Guidance.

Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering
The Bank is subject to various laws and regulations that attempt to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  The USA Patriot Act impacts financial institutions in particular through its anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws.  The USA Patriot Act amended the Bank Secrecy Act and the rules and regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") to establish regulations which, among others, set standards for identifying customers who open an account and promote cooperation with law enforcement agencies and regulators in order to effectively identify parties that may be associated with, or involved in, terrorist activities or money laundering. The Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. OFAC, which is a division of the Treasury, is responsible for helping to ensure that United States entities do not engage in transactions with “enemies” of the United States, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. If the Bank finds a name of an “enemy” of the United States on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze such account or place transferred funds into a blocked account, and report it to OFAC.
Privacy
Financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information.  Customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except for third parties that market the institutions’ own products and services.
In August 2018, the CFPB published its final rule to update Regulation P pursuant to the amended Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Under this rule, certain qualifying financial institutions are not required to provide annual privacy notices to customers. To qualify, a financial institution must not share nonpublic personal information about customers except as described in certain statutory exceptions which do not trigger a customer’s statutory opt-out right. In addition, the financial institution must not have changed its disclosure policies and practices from those disclosed in its most recent privacy notice. The rule sets forth timing requirements for delivery of annual privacy notices in the event that a financial institution that qualified for the annual notice exemption later changes its policies or practices in such a way that it no longer qualifies for the exemption.

Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing through electronic mail to consumers.  The Bank has established policies and procedures designed to safeguard its customers’ personal financial information and to ensure compliance with applicable privacy laws. Although these laws and programs impose compliance costs and create privacy obligations and, in some cases, reporting obligations, and compliance with all of the laws, programs, and privacy and reporting obligations may require significant resources of the Company and the Bank, these laws and programs do not materially affect the Bank’s products, services or other business activities.

Consumer Protection
The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a federal regulatory agency that is responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws for institutions with more than $10 billion of assets and, to a lesser extent, smaller institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to supervise and regulate providers of consumer financial products and services, establishes the CFPB’s power to act against unfair, deceptive or abusive practices, and gives the CFPB rulemaking authority in connection with numerous federal consumer financial protection laws (for example, but not limited to, the Truth-in-Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act).

As a smaller institution (i.e., with assets of $10 billion or less), most consumer protection aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to be applied to the Company by the Federal Reserve and to the Bank by the OCC. However, the CFPB may include its own examiners in regulatory examinations by a smaller institution’s prudential regulators and may require smaller institutions to comply with certain CFPB reporting requirements. In addition, regulatory positions taken by the CFPB and administrative and legal precedents established by CFPB enforcement activities, including in connection with supervision of larger bank holding companies, could influence how the Federal Reserve and OCC apply consumer protection laws and regulations to financial institutions that are not directly supervised by the CFPB. The precise impact of the CFPB’s consumer protection activities cannot be forecasted.

Cybersecurity
The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of a financial institution’s board of directors. These guidelines, along with related regulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial products and services. The federal banking agencies expect financial institutions to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, and also expect financial institutions to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber attack. If the Company or the Bank fails to meet the expectations set forth in this regulatory guidance, the Company or the Bank could be subject to various regulatory actions and any remediation efforts may require significant resources of the Company or the Bank.
In October 2016, the federal banking agencies issued proposed rules on enhanced cybersecurity risk-management and resilience standards that would apply to very large financial institutions and to services provided by third parties to these institutions. The comment period for these proposed rules has closed and a final rule has not been published. Although the proposed rules would apply only to bank holding companies and banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, these rules could influence the federal banking agencies’ expectations and supervisory requirements for information security standards and cybersecurity programs of smaller financial institutions, such as the Company and the Bank.
Stress Testing
As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking agencies have implemented stress testing requirements for certain financial institutions, including bank holding companies and state chartered banks, with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. The EGRRCPA subsequently raised the asset thresholds for company-run stress testing and mandatory stress testing conducted by the Federal Reserve Board to $50 billion and $100 billion, respectively. Although these requirements do not apply to institutions such as the Company and the Bank, the federal banking agencies emphasize that all banking organizations, regardless of size, should have the capacity to analyze the potential impact of adverse market conditions or outcomes on the organization’s financial condition. Based on existing regulatory guidance, the Company and the Bank will be expected to consider the institution’s interest rate risk management, commercial real estate concentrations and other credit-related information, and funding and liquidity management during this analysis of adverse outcomes.
Brokered Deposits 
Section 29 of the FDIA and FDIC regulations generally limit the ability of any bank to accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it is “well capitalized” or, with the FDIC’s approval, “adequately capitalized.” However, as a result of the EGRRCPA, the FDIC is undertaking a comprehensive review of its regulatory approach to brokered deposits, including reciprocal deposits, and interest rate caps applicable to banks that are less than “well capitalized.” At this time, it is difficult to predict the impact, if any, of the FDIC’s review of brokered deposit regulations.
Call Reports and Examination Cycle 
All institutions, regardless of size, submit a quarterly call report that includes data used by federal banking agencies to monitor the condition, performance, and risk profile of individual institutions and the industry as a whole. The EGRRCPA contained provisions expanding the number of regulated institutions eligible to use streamline call report forms. In November 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a proposal to permit insured depository institutions with total assets of less than $5 billion that do not engage in certain complex or international activities to file the most streamlined version of the quarterly call report, and to reduce data reportable on certain streamlined call report submissions. 
In December 2018, consistent with the provisions of the EGRRCPA, the federal banking agencies jointly adopted final rules that permit banks with up to $3 billion in total assets, that received a composite CAMELS rating of “1” or “2,” and that meet certain other criteria (including not having undergone any change in control during the previous 12-month period, and not being subject to a formal enforcement proceeding or order), to qualify for an 18-month on-site examination cycle. Because FRB Atlanta and the OCC have designated the Company and the Bank, respectively, as in “troubled condition,” neither currently qualifies for the EGRRCPA’s shortened examination cycle. 
Other Regulations
Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to federal laws concerning interest rates.  The Bank’s loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:

• | Federal Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;

- 17 -


• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed, or other prohibited factors in extending credit;


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and


• | rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws.

The deposit operations of the Bank are subject to the following:


• | the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;


• | the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Federal Reserve to implement that act, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and


• | the Truth in Savings Act, which requires disclosure of yields and costs of deposits and deposit accounts.

Future Regulation
From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company, the Bank, or any of their subsidiaries could have a material effect on their respective businesses.
Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies
Our earnings are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies, as well as general domestic economic conditions.  The Federal Reserve’s power to implement national monetary policy has had, and is likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of financial institutions.  The Federal Reserve affects the levels of bank loans, investments, and deposits through its control over the issuance of U.S. government securities and through its regulation of the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member bank deposits.  It is difficult to predict the nature, timing or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.
