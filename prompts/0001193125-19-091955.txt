ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 All references to the Liquidating Trust, we, us, our or the Company refer to Winthrop Realty Liquidating Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 General 
 Winthrop Realty Liquidating Trust was organized on July 28, 2016 as a liquidating trust pursuant to a plan of liquidation of Winthrop Realty Trust, which we refer to as Winthrop. Winthrop, which began operations in 1961 under the name First Union Real Estate Equity and Mortgage Investments and changed its name to Winthrop Realty Trust in 2005, was a real estate investment trust formed under the laws of the State of Ohio. Winthrop conducted its business through its wholly owned operating partnership, WRT Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as the Operating Partnership. From January 1, 2004 through August 5, 2016, Winthrop was externally managed by FUR Advisors LLC, which we refer to as FUR Advisors or our Advisor. Since August 5, 2016, FUR Advisors has continued to manage our assets. The Advisor is majority owned by Winthrops former executive officers and senior management, including Michael L. Ashner and Carolyn Tiffany, two of our Trustees. 
 Winthrops primary business was owning real property and real estate related assets. On April 28, 2014 Winthrops Board of Trustees adopted a plan of liquidation. The plan, which provided for an orderly liquidation of Winthrops assets, was approved by holders of a majority of Winthrops common shares of beneficial interests which we refer to as Common Shares at a special meeting of shareholders on August 5, 2014. Under the plan of liquidation, if all of the assets of Winthrop were not disposed of by August 5, 2016, the then remaining assets and liabilities of Winthrop would be assigned to a liquidating trust. 
 On August 5, 2016, in accordance with Winthrops plan of liquidation, Winthrop transferred the then remaining assets and liabilities, including its ownership interests in the Operating Partnership, to the Liquidating Trust. The Liquidating Trust is governed by a Liquidating Trust Agreement by and among Winthrop and Michael L. Ashner, Howard Goldberg and Carolyn Tiffany, as Trustees. Upon the transfer of the assets and liabilities to us on August 5, 2016, each Common Share was automatically converted into one unit of beneficial interest in the Liquidating Trust, which we refer to as Units, and each holder of Common Shares became a beneficiary of the Liquidating Trust, who we refer to as beneficiaries. On October 3, 2016, Winthrop filed a Form 15 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) to terminate the registration of the Common Shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Winthrop ceased filing reports under that Act. In reliance on prior guidance by the SEC, the Liquidating Trust will only file with the SEC annual reports on Form 10-K and current reports on Form 8-K.
The sole purpose of the Liquidating Trust is to wind up the affairs of Winthrop by liquidating its remaining assets, satisfying the assumed liabilities, paying all costs and expenses of the Liquidating Trust and distributing the remaining proceeds to the beneficiaries. We have no objective to continue or engage in the conduct of a trade or business, except as necessary for the orderly liquidation of the remaining assets. 
 Under the plan of liquidation Winthrop was not, and under our Liquidating Trust Agreement, we are not, permitted to make any new investments other than protective acquisitions or advances with respect to our existing assets. We are permitted to satisfy any existing contractual obligations including any capital call requirements and acquisitions or dispositions pursuant to buy-sell provisions under existing joint venture documentation and pay for required tenant improvements and capital expenditures at our real estate properties. We are also permitted to invest our cash reserves in short-term U.S. Treasuries or other short-term obligations. The Liquidating Trust Agreement enables us to sell any and all of our assets without further approval of the beneficiaries and provides that liquidating distributions be made to the beneficiaries as determined by our Trustees.

 Pursuant to the Liquidating Trust Agreement, our affairs are overseen by three Trustees, Michael L. Ashner, Howard Goldberg and Carolyn Tiffany. Until such time as our remaining assets were less than $250 million, the Liquidating Trust was required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have one of its Trustees satisfy the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange which we refer to as NYSE. Howard Goldberg satisfied and continues to satisfy the independence requirements of the NYSE. FUR Advisors continues to administer our day to day affairs including overseeing the operation, management and disposition of our remaining assets. For providing these and other services, FUR Advisors is entitled to a base management fee and, in certain instances, an incentive fee and termination fee. See Employees below for a description of the fees payable to FUR Advisors. 
 As a liquidating trust, Units are not freely transferable. Units will generally not be transferable except by will, intestate succession or operation of law. Therefore, the beneficiaries do not have the ability to realize any value from the Units except from distributions made by the Liquidating Trust, the timing of which will be solely at the discretion of our Trustees. 
 The Liquidating Trust will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the distribution of all of the remaining assets of the Liquidating Trust in accordance with the terms of the Liquidating Trust Agreement, or (ii) August 5, 2019. The Liquidating Trust may be extended beyond August 5, 2019 if our Trustees determine that an extension is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose of the Liquidating Trust. It is presently anticipated that the Liquidating Trust will be extended until at least December 31, 2019 in order to complete the liquidation. 
 The dissolution process and the amount and timing of distributions involves risks and uncertainties. As such, it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate amount of liquidation proceeds that will actually be distributed to beneficiaries or the timing of such payments. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the distributions will equal or exceed the estimate of net assets presented in the Consolidated Statements of Net Assets. Prior to August 5, 2016, Winthrop paid liquidating distributions totaling $7.75 per Common Share. Subsequent to the transfer to the Liquidating Trust, liquidating distributions totaling $9.05 per Unit have been paid.

On our website you can obtain, free of charge, a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such material electronically with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the SEC. 
 Assets 
 At the time of the adoption of the plan of liquidation, Winthrop held 20 consolidated operating properties, 18 equity investments, eight loans receivable, one secured financing receivable and one loan security. At December 31, 2018, we held one consolidated operating property (Churchill, Pennsylvania) and three equity investments (WRT-Highline LLC, Atrium Mall LLC and 701 Seventh WRT Investor LLC). 
 At December 31, 2018 we had total assets of $17,009,000 and net assets in liquidation of $12,425,000. The net assets in liquidation at December 31, 2018 would result in liquidating distributions of approximately $0.34 per Unit; provided, however, no assurance can be given that the ultimate distributions made will equal or exceed such estimate. 
 Operating Properties 
 See Item 2. Properties for a description of our Operating Properties

 Disposition Activity 
 701 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York  property sale  On April 30, 2018, the venture in which we held an indirect interest in the property located at 701 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York, sold the property to an affiliate of a current indirect member of the venture, for a gross sales price of $1,530,000,000. Upon closing, $63,700,000 of the proceeds was placed in escrow pending completion of the development of the property and the joint venture also received a purchase money note in the amount of $75,000,000. We received cash proceeds of approximately $200,000,000 at the time of closing. Subsequent to closing, the purchase money note was satisfied and we received $16,598,000 which represented our proportionate share of the purchase money note. We do not expect to receive any funds related to the escrow. The sale price was consistent with our liquidation value at December 31, 2017. 
 1050 Corporetum, Lisle, Illinois  foreclosure  On February 20, 2018, the 1050 Corporetum office property located in Lisle, Illinois, in which we held a 60% interest, was foreclosed. The foreclosure was not contested as the value of the property, plus the costs to sell, was less than the outstanding debt balance as of the foreclosure date. The liquidation value at foreclosure was based on the outstanding debt balance, closing costs and certain other factors related to the foreclosure and is consistent with the liquidation value at December 31, 2017. 
 Plantation, Florida  property sale  On September 4, 2018, we sold to an independent third party our office property located in Plantation, Florida for gross proceeds of $11,250,000 and received net proceeds of $1,074,000 after satisfaction of third party mortgage debt, closing costs and customary prorations. The liquidation value was $18,364,000 at December 31, 2017. 
 Jacksonville, Florida  loan receivable sale  On October 11, 2018, we sold to an independent third party our loan receivable associated with the Jacksonville, Florida property for gross proceeds of $8,097,000 and received net proceeds of $8,080,000 after satisfaction of closing costs and customary prorations. The liquidation value was $8,400,000 at December 31, 2017 
 Concord Debt Holdings and CDH CDO LLC  loan sales  During 2018, we received aggregate distributions of $812,000 from our Concord joint ventures in connection with the sales of their final assets. The liquidation value was $329,000 at December 31, 2017. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018 we had no employees. Our day to day affairs are administered by the Advisor pursuant to the terms of an advisory agreement, as the same may be amended from time to time, which we refer to as the Advisory Agreement. The Advisory Agreement had an initial term of five years beginning on January 1, 2013 and is automatically renewed for successive one-year periods unless terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Advisory Agreement. 
 Under the Advisory Agreement, our Advisor was paid a quarterly base management fee which totaled $964,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The base management fee was determined based on the aggregate issuance price of the Common Shares at August 1, 2016. The Advisory Agreement provides that any liquidating distributions paid on account of Units that result in a reduction of the threshold amount (as described below) are deemed a reduction in the aggregate issuance price of the Common Shares, thereby resulting in a reduction of the base management fee. As of the June 30, 2018, the base management fee was reduced to zero. In addition to the base management fee, our Advisor received a termination fee and is entitled to receive an incentive fee for administering the Liquidating Trust. Further, our Advisor, or its affiliate, is also entitled to receive property management fees and construction management fees at commercially reasonable rates. 
 The incentive fee is equal to 20% of any amounts available for distribution in excess of the threshold amount and is only payable at such time, if at all, (i) when holders of our Units receive aggregate distributions above the threshold amount or (ii) upon termination of the Advisory Agreement if the net value of our assets exceeds the

  threshold amount based on then current market values and appraisals. That is, the incentive fee is not payable annually but only at such time, if at all, as we have paid liquidating distributions from and after December 31, 2018 in excess of the threshold amount ($17,391,000 on December 31, 2018) plus an annual return thereon equal to the greater of (x) 4% or (y) the 5 year U.S. Treasury Yield plus 2.5% (such return, the Growth Factor) less any distributions paid from and after January 1, 2019). The incentive fee will also be payable if the Advisory Agreement is terminated, other than for cause (as defined) by us or with cause by our Advisor, and if on the date of termination the net value of the Liquidating Trusts assets exceeds the threshold amount. At December 31, 2018 the threshold amount required to be distributed before any incentive fee would be payable to FUR Advisors was $17,391,000, which was equivalent to $0.49 per Unit. At December 31, 2018, based on our estimate of liquidating distributions, it is estimated that the Advisor would be not be entitled to an incentive fee. 
 On May 2, 2018 the Advisor was paid a termination fee of $9,496,000. The termination fee was payable equal to the lesser of (i) the base management fee paid to our Advisor for the twelve month period immediately prior to the approved plan of liquidation or (ii) 20% of any liquidating distributions paid on account of our Units at such time as the threshold amount was reduced to $104,980,000. No additional termination fee payments will be paid. 
 Competition 
 We currently compete with other properties located in markets in which our assets are located both from an operations perspective and with respect to the disposition of our assets. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business and our net assets in liquidation. 
 We derive significant benefit from our present advisor structure, where our Advisors experienced management team provides us with resources at substantially less cost than if such persons were directly employed by us. Through its broad experience, our Advisors senior management team has established a network of contacts and relationships, including relationships with operators, financing sources, investment bankers, commercial real estate brokers, potential tenants and other key industry participants. 
 Environmental Regulations 
 Our operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. These are discussed further under Item 1A  Risk Factors. 
Segment Data 
 With the adoption of the plan of liquidation we have only one reporting and operating segment subsequent to July 31, 2014.
