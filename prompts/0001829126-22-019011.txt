Corporate History and Overview
 
SmartMetric, Inc. (“SmartMetric” or the “Company”) is a company that was incorporated pursuant to the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2002 and is focused on the biometric technology manufacturing industry. SmartMetric has an issued patent covering technology that involves connection to networks using data cards (smart cards and EMV cards). In addition, SmartMetric holds the sole license to five issued patents covering features of its biometric fingerprint activated cards. SmartMetric’s main products are fingerprint sensor activated payments card for use in the credit and debit card industry, which are currently under development. The SmartMetric fingerprint biometric cards being developed by the Company have a rechargeable battery allowing for portable biometric identification and card activation prior to being presented to or inserted in, a credit or debit card reader. These cards are herein sometimes referred to as a biometric card or the SmartMetric Biometric Card.
The Market for Biometric Credit Cards
 
Estimated Market Size
 
The estimated size of the market for biometric credit and debit cards is significant. While the company is not making any projections on the actual size of the market a number of industry figures point to the outsized market size and potential.
 
According to EMVCo, which is a credit card standards body responsible for the licensing and rules governing EMV chips used on today’s credit and debit cards, more than 10 billion EMV chip cards have been issued by banks globally.
 
SmartMetric contracted an independent consumer market research company to ascertain the potential consumer demand for a credit card with incorporated fingerprint biometrics. The survey was conducted in the USA and the respondents were Visa credit card users.
 
The result of the consumer research survey is as follows.
 
1: Are you concerned about credit card or identity fraud?
 
Answered Yes: 80.1%
 
2: Would you pay for a safer biometric secured credit card that has a built-in fingerprint reader for your protection?
 
Answered Yes: 65.5%
 
3: What would you prefer to pay for a biometric fingerprint secured safer credit card?
 
Answer 1: $69.95 onetime charge for the life of the card (3 years) 60.2%
 
Answer 2: $8.95 per month (includes identity theft insurance) 39.7%
 
Given these consumer research results and given the number of credit cards issued by banks, it is a large potential market that SmartMetric is developing its product for.
 
All credit and debit cards that are to be issued by a Bank must be tested and approved of by the card brand network that the card is to operate on. Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Diners brands and networks all have their own individual testing and approval procedures. The card brand that SmartMetric is working with published its biometric testing procedures in March of 2021. This caused SmartMetric to make changes to its card design, adding its newly invented anti-spoofing live fingerprint detection technology to its biometric card.

The SmartMetric Biometric Technology and Products
 
SmartMetric’s founder, Chaya Hendrick, is the originator and inventor of various miniature biometric activated cards, including the SmartMetric biometric fingerprint activated payments card with an embedded fully functional fingerprint reader inside the card, which is currently in development. The design of the card is the size and thickness of a standard credit card. The SmartMetric biometric payments card should provide high level security for credit and debit cards by adding biometric authentication and activation to Europay, MasterCard and Visa (“EMV”) chip cards in use around the world. The SmartMetric biometric payments card will be engineered to be inoperable with existing EMV chip card readers, ATMs as well as banking payments infrastructure. Using the advanced electronic miniaturization by SmartMetric to make its biometric credit/debit cards, the Company is also in development of a multi-functional biometric building access control and logical network access card.
 
SmartMetric has commenced efforts towards creating a biometric health insurance card with memory for storing a person’s medical files, including medical images. This should allow a person to securely take with them their private medical files inside the card when traveling away from home. For the first time, a person’s complete medical files would be stored in a credit card-sized card and the information is only able to be accessed by the card holder’s own fingerprint.
 
SmartMetric is developing its rechargeable battery powered fingerprint reader that is of a scale that fits “inside” a standard credit or debit card. The cardholder would then have stored inside the card his or her fingerprint. To activate the card, the person would swipe the fingerprint sensor, the sensor would connect to an internal microprocessor that manages the fingerprint sensor, fingerprint image capture and comparison matching with the pre-stored fingerprint of the cardholder held in the internal electronic memory of the card. The card is being designed to have a surface mounted EMV chip as found on EMV banking chip cards that is activated or turned on only after a card holder’s fingerprint has been scanned and verified using the SmartMetric miniature “in-card” biometric scanner. It is important to note that as of the date of this filing, no prototype yet exists.
 
There are over ten (10) billion EMV chip cards used by banks around the world for credit cards, ATM cards and debit cards according to EMVco. SmartMetric sees this existing user base as a natural market for its advanced biometric activated card technology for the credit and debit card market. SmartMetric has established a network of card manufacturers and technology distributors to market its in-card biometric products to card issuing banks and in the case of the SmartMetric biometric security card, to businesses, once fully developed.
 
SmartMetric is also developing a multi-function logical and physical access security card the size and thickness of a standard credit card. Utilizing the small size breakthroughs by the Company in its biometric payments card development, SmartMetric is now developing a biometric security card that is the size and thickness of a standard credit card that can easily fit inside a person’s wallet.
 
As with the biometric payments card, the SmartMetric security card will have an internal rechargeable battery that is used to power the card’s internal processor used in the biometric fingerprint scan. All functions and operations of the card are subject to a valid fingerprint scan and match of the card user.
 
Additional technological advances have now been made with regard to both the Company’s biometric credit/debit card and its multifunction cyber security, building access biometric card, both of which are still under development and have not yet been produced.
 
In Card Fingerprint Matching and Verification
 
The SmartMetric Biometric card will incorporate a rechargeable, lithium polymer battery. This battery should be rechargeable and very thin, and it has been designed by SmartMetric to fit inside the SmartMetric fingerprint credit card sized card. This battery is planned to be manufactured by a third party unaffiliated with the Company to SmartMetric’s specifications. This battery is planned to be embedded inside the card.
 
Other components needed for manufacture of the SmartMetric Biometric Card include, but are not limited to, sensors, microchips, memory chips and processor chips. The ultra-thin circuit board developed by SmartMetric has, in total, nearly 200 active and passive components. The sources and availability of these materials are numerous, and readily available in SmartMetric’s view, and should not affect the ability of SmartMetric to meet future demand. However, the supply of memory processors and passive components may be interrupted at any time based on global supply/demand issues. We are still in our design and development phase and have not experienced component supply issues to date, and we plan, as a matter of policy, to alternative component sources to mitigate and protect against future potential supply chain issues.

The biometric card is being designed to offer the option of a built-in radio frequency transmitter for contactless access and identity verification. The RFID contactless chip transmission would then be turned on using the card users fingerprint verification.
 
The thinness form factor of many of the planned components has also resulted in the Company having to develop its own process for high volume electronic assembly. The Company believes that it has also successfully overcome the challenge of developing a process of encapsulating the electronics in plastic to create the credit card sized biometric fingerprint activated card that also has an internal rechargeable battery.
 
Standard credit card manufacturing utilizes machines that require high pressure and high temperature in fusing top and bottom sheets of plastic together thereby encasing any electronics inside the card. Given the complexity of the card’s electronics and vulnerability to an assembly process involving high heat and high pressure, damage to the electronic circuitry in our planned biometric card is a major challenge for the Company to overcome. Research and development activities of the Company have allowed the Company to develop a production plan and process that addresses this challenge, and this trade secret process should protect the silicon and internal battery that will be mounted directly onto the card’s internal electronics circuit board.
 
The Security Technology Industry
 
SmartMetric Biometric Multi-Function Security Card
 
SmartMetric is developing a multi-function logical and physical access security card the size and thickness of a standard credit card. Utilizing the small size breakthroughs by the Company in its biometric payments card development, SmartMetric is developing a biometric security card that can easily fit inside a person’s wallet.
 
As with the biometric payments card, the SmartMetric security card will have an internal rechargeable battery that is used to power the card’s internal processor used in the biometric fingerprint scan. All functions and operations of the card are subject to a valid fingerprint scan and match of the card user.

Biometrics
 
Biometric technologies identify users by electronically capturing a specific biological or behavioral characteristic of that individual, such as a fingerprint or voice or facial feature, and creating a unique digital identifier from that characteristic. Because this process relies on largely unalterable human characteristics, positive identification can be achieved independent of any information possessed by the individual seeking authorization.
 
The process of identity authentication typically requires that a person present for comparison with one or more of the following factors:
 

● | Something known such as a password, PIN, or mother’s maiden name; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Something carried such as a token, card, or key; or 
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | something physical such as fingerprint, voice pattern, signature motion, facial shape or other biological or behavioral characteristic. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Comparison of biological and behavioral characteristics has historically been the most reliable and accurate of the three factors but has also been the most difficult and costly to implement into a single product that can automatically verify the identity of a user accessing a computer network or the Internet. However, recent advances in biometric collection technologies (both biometric hardware products and their associated processing software) have increased the speed and accuracy and reduced the cost of implementing biometrics in commercial environments. Management believes that individuals, website operators, government organizations, and businesses will increasingly use this method of identity authentication.
 
Biometrics refers to the automatic identification of a person based on his/her physiological or behavioral characteristics. This method of identification is preferred over traditional methods involving passwords and personal identification numbers (“PINs”) for two reasons: (i) the person to be identified is required to be physically present at the point of identification to be identification; and (ii) identification based on biometric techniques obviates the need to remember a password or carry a token. By replacing PINs, biometric techniques can potentially prevent unauthorized access to or fraudulent use of cellular phones, Biometric cards, desktop PCs, workstations, and computer networks. It can be used during transactions conducted via telephone and Internet (e-commerce and e-banking). In automobiles, biometrics could replace keys-less entry devices. The SmartMetric fingerprint activated credit card that has the fingerprint encased inside the credit card has been developed to replace the less secure PIN’s for credit and debit cards.
 
PINs and passwords may be forgotten, may be hacked and token-based methods of identification, e.g., passports and driver’s licenses, may be forged, stolen or lost. Various types of biometric systems are being used for real-time identification, with the most popular based on facial recognition and fingerprint matching. Other biometric systems utilize iris and retinal scanning, speech, facial thermograms and hand geometry. Of the biometric options available to work with a credit or debit card, fingerprint scanning is the only biometric methodology that has been successfully reduced in size to fit inside such cards.
 
A biometric system is essentially a pattern recognition system, which makes a personal identification by determining the authenticity of a specific physiological or behavioral characteristic possessed by the user. An important issue in designing a practical system is to determine how an individual is identified.
 
There are two different ways to resolve a person’s identity; verification and identification. Verification (Am I whom I claim I am?) involves confirming or denying a person’s claimed identity. In identification, one has to establish a person’s identity (Who am I?).
 
As stated above, the SmartMetric fingerprint biometric card has been designed as a credit-card sized card embedded with an integrated circuit, contact chip and biometric fingerprint sensor. The SmartMetric card has been designed to provide not only memory capacity, but also computational capability along with secure non-refutable identification of the user. We believe that the self-containment of SmartMetric’s card makes it substantially resistant to attack, as it will not need to depend upon vulnerable external resources. Because of this characteristic, we expect that the SmartMetric biometric card may be used in different applications, which require strong security protection and authentication.

The physical structure of a card is specified by the International Standards Organization (“ISO”). Generally, this structure is made up of three elements: (i) the plastic card, which is the most basic one and has the dimensions of 85.60mm x 53.98 x 0.80mm; (ii) an electronic circuit board inlay; and (iii) a contact chip that are embedded in the card.
 
The SmartMetric card has been designed to conform to ISO standards. The electronic circuit inlay is a part of, and not distinct from, the biometric card.
 
The communication line between the card and ATMs and other standard Smart Card reading devices is bi-directional serial transmission, which conforms to ISO standards. Card commands and input data are sent to the chip that responds with status words and output data upon the receipt of these commands and data. Information is sent in half duplex mode (transmission of data is in one direction at a time). This protocol, together with the restriction of the bit rate, is designed to prevent data attack on the card. Other data protection systems are utilized inside the card including advanced encryption.
 
In general, the size, the thickness and bend requirements for the biometric card were designed to protect the card from being spoiled physically.
 
Recent Developments
 
SmartMetric has presented its fingerprint activated biometric card to a large global payments network and credit/debit card brand. The company has been advised that the card testing and approval requirements for this network is that the company’s biometric fingerprint scanning must be able to differentiate between a live finger and a fake finger at the time of fingerprint scanning. This is to protect the card from what is called in the industry, spoofing.
 
The adopted method for this kind of anti-spoofing detection within the biometric industry is performed through intelligent software analysis done at the time of the fingerprint scan. SmartMetric has tested this methodology and was not confident in its robustness in performing the task at hand. So as to ensure a high level of anti-spoofing capability, SmartMetric has developed its own method that it believes exceeds the normal standard within the biometric industry.
 
SmartMetric is in development of its advanced live finger detection method and is now working on its incorporation into the company’s biometric card. Once this has been completed, the company will then be presenting its card for testing as a biometric card to the global payments network. SmartMetric has received a license from this network to move forward with its product testing by the networks designated biometric card test laboratory.
 
The company’s product is being engineered differently from most other biometric cards that have been announced in that it has its own internal rechargeable battery. This is important and a must if the card is to be used at ATM’s.
 
Other differentiations are the now newly developed advanced anti-spoofing technology.
 
Various versions of the SmartMetric fingerprint biometric card are under development including but not limited to a version that has one time password OTP display and another that has a small display for showing the cards CVV.
 
Other cards under development based on the company’s biometric technology include memory cards with up to 2GB of memory. Also cards that have much larger display screens that can display such things as Q-Codes.
 
The large-scale memory fingerprint biometric protected card has potential application in the portable medical records industry as well as advanced applications in the banking and financial transaction industries.
 
Years of research and development has gone into the miniaturization of the electronics at the core of the SmartMetric fingerprint biometric card. All of the design and electronic engineering has been undertaken by SmartMetric and is the owned property and trade secrets of the company.
 
The card being developed by SmartMetric has its own ARM Cortex processor along with additional memory. The user’s fingerprint is stored inside the cards memory and is protected by advanced very strong elliptic curve cryptography.

Government Regulation
 
There are currently no governmental regulations, which have any bearing on the raw materials or the manufacturing of our payments card products. United States federal departments such as the Department of Defense have rules and regulations concerning security features of smart cards used as identity or building and cyber access cards. These regulations stipulate a specific licensing and testing protocol for such cards.
Banking Industry Self-Regulation
 
The EMV chip used in chip cards are subject to licensing and testing by the banking-controlled body called EMVco. EMVco is an acronym standing for Europay, MasterCard and Visa. These international payments card networks were the founding parties of EMVco.
 
Individual payments networks such as Visa, Mastercard, Europay, American Express, Union Pay Dinners and JCB all have their own individual licensing and testing standards and processes.
 
Research and Development
 
Our research and development program is focused on ongoing development of new products built on our existing biometric card. We continue to refine our technology and develop further improvements to our biometric card products. We have finalized our first biometric EMV payments card product. We have also concluded the design and electronic engineering for our soon-to-be released multi-function security and access control biometric cards. Research and development will continue as the Company continues to innovate and develop new biometric card-based products. Future biometric card-based products the Company is now working on, include but are not limited to: (a) health insurance card with stored in-card medical records; (b) national identity card; and (c) drivers’ licenses.
 
The Company has developed and is continuing to develop its own embedded systems and application software that works with the SmartMetric Biometric Card. This development software and systems and ongoing electronic design and development requires the company to continue to expend time and financial resources on significant software development. Currently, the Company has electronic and software engineers working in Tel Aviv, Israel and Buenos Aires, Argentina.
 
Competition
 
Various potential competitors have announced products similar to that of SmartMetric’s. It is understood that “announced” is defined as a person to hold their finger on the cards fingerprint sensor while it is in a card reader. Unlike the SmartMetric biometric card that is powered from its own internal rechargeable battery, this other type of card does not allow the card to be used in most restaurants that need to take the card away from the table for processing at the checkout. It also does not allow their other type of card to be used at the vast majority of ATM’s.
Employees
 
As of the date of this annual report, we have one full time employee, our Chief Executive Officer and President, Chaya Hendrick. We primarily use direct contract hires in administration and engineering, as is common in the information technology world.

Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 18, 2002 and our principal office is located in Las Vegas, Nevada. Since our inception, we have invested a substantial portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our products. We have generated no revenues from the sale of our products and have experienced substantial net operating losses.
 
We entered into a royalty and licensing agreement with Chaya Hendrick, our CEO, which requires substantial payments by us on an annual basis and additionally in the event gross revenues are derived, which could harm our financial position.
 
Pursuant to a licensing and royalty agreement, entered into on September 11, 2017 by the Company and Chaya Hendrick, our founder and CEO, we received a license to certain patents related to our technologies until the expiration of such patents in exchange for the following: (i) issuance of 200,000 Series B Convertible Preferred Shares, (ii) 5% of gross revenues derived from the sale of products derived from the patents, and (iii) annual payments beginning at $50,000 per annum, increased by 100% of each previous year (offset against 5% gross revenue royalty payments). We believe these patents are instrumental our business plan and if we are unable to make such required payments under the license agreement, Chaya Hendrick may terminate the agreement, which may materially impact our business plan. As of June 30, 2022, we had issued the 200,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock as required by the license agreement, and Ms. Hendrick had waived the right to annual payments through June 30, 2022. There can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to meet our financial obligations under the terms of the agreement unless we are able to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities or derive revenue from some other source.
