Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands on July 23, 2018 for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to in this report as our initial business combination. On August 2, 2019, we entered into a Combination and Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with Campalier, S.A. de C.V., Promotora Forteza, S.A. de C.V., Strevo, S.A. de C.V. (collectively, the “Sellers”), Betterware de México, S.A. de C.V. (“Betterware”), BLSM Latino América Servicios, S.A. de C.V. (“BLSM”), and, solely for the purposes of Article XI therein, our sponsor, pursuant to which we agreed to merge (the “Merger”) with and into Betterware in a business combination (the “Business Combination”) that will result in Betterware surviving the Merger (the “combined company”) and BLSM becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the combined company.
 
In July 2018, we issued 1,473,500 founder shares to our sponsor for $25,000 in cash, at a purchase price of approximately $0.02 per share. In September 2018, our sponsor forfeited 36,000 founder shares, resulting in an aggregate of 1,437,500 founder shares outstanding. In November 2018, our sponsor forfeited 46,250 founder shares following the expiration of the unexercised portion of the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters in connection with our initial public offering, thereby reducing the number of founder shares held by the sponsor to 1,391,250.
 
The registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-227423) for our initial public offering was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 11, 2018. On October 16, 2018, we consummated our initial public offering of 5,000,000 units, with each unit consisting of one ordinary share, no par value, and one warrant, each warrant exercisable to purchase one ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. On October 23, 2018, the underwriters for our initial public offering purchased an additional 565,000 units pursuant to the partial exercise of their over-allotment option. The units in our initial public offering were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $55,650,000.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering and the closing of the over-allotment option, we consummated private placements of 225,000 and 14,125 private units, respectively, to our sponsor at a price of $10.00 per private unit, generating total proceeds of $2,391,250 (the “private placements”).
 
A total of $55,650,000 (or $10.00 per unit sold in our initial public offering) of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placements was placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public shareholders (the “trust account”), with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and has been invested only in U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) the distribution of the trust account, as described below, except that interest earned on the trust account can be released to pay our taxes payable and for dissolution or liquidation expenses up to $50,000, as applicable.
 
Transaction costs amounted to $1,939,920, consisting of $1,391,250 of underwriting fees, and $548,670 of other costs. As of June 30, 2019, we had $175,830 in our operating bank accounts, $56,588,390 in securities held in the trust account to be used for a business combination or to repurchase or redeem our ordinary shares in connection therewith and a working capital deficit of $235,000.
 
Our units began trading on October 12, 2018 on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “DDMXU.” Commencing on October 23, 2018, the ordinary shares and warrants comprising the units began separate trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “DDMX” and “DDMXW,” respectively. Those units not separated continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “DDMXU.”
 
In July 2019, our sponsor transferred all of the outstanding founder shares and 47,825 private units to certain of our directors and officers and their affiliates (as permitted transferees) at the price originally paid for such securities, and such transferred securities remain subject to the escrow and transfer restrictions described elsewhere in this report.

Management Expertise
 
We have sought and will continue to seek to capitalize on the operating and investing experience and network of relationships of Dr. Martín Werner, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jorge Combe, our Chief Operating Officer, and our other officers and directors in consummating an initial business combination. During their careers, Dr. Werner and Mr. Combe have been involved in merger and acquisition transactions and bond offerings valued, in the aggregate, at more than $90 billion in the retail and consumer, financial services, infrastructure, energy, leisure and real estate industries. Dr. Werner and Mr. Combe have over 40 years of combined experience in the financial services industry, most notably as a Partner and Managing Director, respectively, of Goldman Sachs.
 
During their time at Goldman Sachs, Dr. Werner and Mr. Combe led the Mexico and Latin-American Investment Banking Division in expanding its client network in various industries and embracing a leadership position in the region by executing mergers and acquisitions transactions, initial public offerings, capital raising, debt raising, leveraged buyouts and private equity transactions.
 
Dr. Werner was also instrumental in positioning Goldman Sachs as a regional player of private infrastructure investments. He worked alongside Goldman Sachs Infrastructure Partners, the infrastructure fund that focuses on transportation, energy and utilities investments with a long-term strategy and over $10 billion in assets under management, on their $4.1 billion investment through a joint venture with Empresas ICA in Red de Carreteras de Occidente (RCO), Mexico’s largest private concessionaire that operates an aggregate of more than 760km of toll roads in four separate locations. Dr. Werner’s participation in RCO was a catalyst in transforming and accelerating RCO’s business growth. Dr. Werner continues to serve as RCO’s president and chairman of the board of directors.
 
Our management team has extensive knowledge of the local market in Mexico and we believe they have the requisite skills to search for and consummate a business combination. For example, Dr. Werner was involved in Citigroup’s acquisition of Grupo Financiero Banamex, S.A. de C.V., in several Telmex/America Movil acquisitions in Latin America, and in many transactions for Mexico’s energy companies, Petroleos Mexicanos, S.A. de C.V. and Comision Federal de Electricidad, S.A. de C.V. Mr. Combe was heavily involved in sales transactions in the consumer and pharma sectors, particularly to Mars, Incorporated and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and in the real estate sector in the initial offering of TF Administradora, s. de R.L. de C.V. (Terrafina) and Concentradora Fibra Danhos S.A. de C.V., and follow-on offerings for Fibra Uno Adminisracion S.A. de C.V. and Hotelera Mexicana, S.A. de C.V., among others.
 
In addition to the foregoing, we have sought and will continue to seek to capitalize on the investment expertise of DD3 Capital Partners S.A. de C.V. (“DD3 Capital”), an affiliate of our sponsor, and support from its platform, in consummating an initial business combination. DD3 Capital is a private investment and financial services firm founded in 2016 by Dr. Werner and Mr. Combe and headquartered in Mexico City. DD3 Capital provides a wide range of financial services to its clients including, among others, merger and acquisitions advisory, equity and debt capital raising, highly structured debt financing and financial restructurings. The firm distinguishes itself by providing holistic investment advice, access to exclusive investment opportunities and creating innovative solutions for clients with tailored services aligned to long-term goals. Despite its nascent operations, DD3 Capital manages over $50 million in assets. DD3 Capital’s investments are generally comprised of:
 

• | Mezzanine Lending: Loans for residential real estate projects with terms from 12 to 48 months.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Capital Loans: Loans for mid-term projects in a variety of sectors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Equity Investments: Preferred or common equity in long-term assets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In 2018, DD3 Capital established a partnership with LarrainVial S.A., a leading full-service Chilean financial services firm with operations in Peru and Colombia, and Grupo Patio XI, one of the largest real estate developers in Latin America, which have a combined 20% ownership stake in DD3 Capital. We believe that this partnership, which is geographically complementary to DD3 Capital’s operations, will expand the business opportunities in local and international markets that are available to us.
 
Additionally, our board members possess a number of attributes that we believe will enhance our ability to create value for our shareholders through a successful business combination. Our board members collectively serve on more than 24 company boards and have first-hand knowledge of potential deals and transactions in Mexico. In particular, Dr. Guillermo Ortiz, one of our independent directors, has extensive professional experience as Secretary of Finance and Public Credit and as the Governor of the Bank of Mexico, where he was employed from 1998 to 2009 under two different government administrations, actively contributing to maintaining Mexico’s economic stability during the financial crisis and making headwinds in emerging markets. Dr. Ortiz has long-standing relationships with industry executives, owners of private and public companies, capital market investors, private equity funds and government officials.

We intend to identify and seek to consummate a business combination with a business that could benefit from a hands-on partner with extensive financial experience. Even fundamentally sound companies can often under-perform due to underinvestment, temporary periods of dislocation in the markets in which they operate, over-levered capital structures, excessive cost structures, incomplete management teams and/or inappropriate business strategies. Our management team has extensive experience in identifying, structuring and executing acquisitions across various industries to capture arbitrage opportunities and managing assets to optimize a business’s performance. In addition, our team has significant hands-on experience working with private companies, from preparing and executing an initial public offering to being active owners and directors. Our management team has been instrumental, working closely with companies, in implementing major business transformations and helping to create value through the public markets. Dr. Werner and Mr. Combe have developed an extensive network of relationships through their careers, ranging from owners of private and public companies, private equity funds, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and business brokers to executives of government-owned entities and public officials. We believe that this network will allow us to generate a substantial number of attractive risk-adjusted acquisition opportunities. Our management team is confident that its ability to identify and implement value creation initiatives will remain central to its unique acquisition strategy. Our management team’s objective is to generate attractive financial returns and create significant value for our shareholders by using its relationships with top individuals and industry players in the region.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the past successes of Dr. Werner and Mr. Combe, DD3 Capital, our other officers and directors, and their respective affiliates, is not a guarantee that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or realize success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of such individuals’ or entity’s performance as indicative of our future performance. None of our officers or directors has had experience with blank check companies or special purpose acquisition companies in the past.
 
Target Business Focus
 
We have focused our search on target businesses located in Mexico and Hispanic businesses located in the U.S., although we are not limited to companies in these geographic areas. We strongly believe there is a vast number of opportunities in Mexico. Mexico currently has a population of approximately 130 million and a $1.2 trillion gross domestic product, or GDP, making it the 15th largest global economy and the second largest in Latin America. Mexico has a resilient macroeconomic backdrop and strong economic foundation. Mexico’s economy continues to grow with diversified foreign direct investment, or FDI, sources, competitive edges and solid structural reforms that are able to absorb economic shocks and support GDP growth.
 
Mexico’s economic growth accelerated in 2018 with a real GDP growth of 2.0% in 2018, largely as a result of an improved outlook for the U.S. economy. While manufacturing is expected to act as a major driver of growth over the coming decade, we believe Mexico is set to begin transitioning toward a more services-oriented economy with stronger private consumers boosting the country’s economic outlook.
 
Mexico is also an open economy with a network of 13 free trade agreements encompassing 50 countries, 32 Reciprocal Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements, or RIPPAs, with 33 countries, and nine trade agreements, including NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, among others. Although the United States represents more than 80% of Mexico’s total exports, relaxed regulation of Mexico’s energy sector and manufacturing industry will be an important anchor of future direct investment and solid economic expansion that will diversify the country’s trade partnerships and improve cross-border growth opportunities. Nevertheless, Mexico is experiencing high volatility in foreign exchange rates, headwinds in the local stock market, and uncertainty from private company owners. Thus, we are seeking to benefit from the country’s current status and capitalize on investment opportunities with attractive valuations and very favorable medium-term fundamentals by applying our experience in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.
 
Mexico’s capital markets and banking penetration levels are more comparable to those of less developed economies and fixed investments are the main driver of economic growth. Over the last couple of years, the Mexican Stock Exchange has tried to encourage investors through the incorporation of new investment vehicles; nevertheless, the Mexican stock market lacks a diverse sophisticated investors base to fully exploit the potential benefits of the investment. As a result, the Mexican stock market has not been effective in allowing high growth medium size companies to raise equity. We believe that this market imperfection will allow us to capitalize on unique opportunities as many companies will find alternative sources of capital and a U.S. listing extremely attractive and enables them to continue to grow and thrive. Given the significant valuation discount to relevant public peers that mid-market companies usually carry in Mexico and DD3 Capital’s experience in executing deals with similar private companies, we believe that we can create attractive upside potential to public investors through a business combination.

On July 1, 2018, popular elections were held in Mexico to vote for the president, members of the Congress and other federal and local offices. As a result of the electoral process, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who was running as the candidate of the Together We Make History (Juntos Haremos Historia) alliance, was elected President of Mexico and took office on December 1, 2018. Additionally, the Together We Make History alliance won a majority in Congress and most of the governorships and local congresses. The victory achieved by the Together We Make History alliance in the federal executive branch and the Congress could result in either the implementation of substantial changes to, the Mexican Constitution, federal laws, ordinances, regulations and policies currently in force in Mexico or the continuity of prior approved laws and policies that are necessary or convenient for Mexico’s development. The implementation of changes to the current laws could generate uncertainty, which in turn could affect the country’s economic situation and the stability of the peso, among other macroeconomic variables. The past elections, both at the federal and local levels, and the uncertainty associated with the measures to be implemented by the new government could significantly affect Mexico’s development. On November 30, 2018, the presidents of Mexico, the United States and Canada signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or the USMCA, which has only been ratified by Mexico. Once ratified by the legislatures of the three countries, the USMCA would replace NAFTA. As of the date of this report, there is uncertainty about whether the USMCA will be ratified by the United States and Canada, as well as the timing thereof, and the potential for further re-negotiation, or even termination, of NAFTA. We cannot provide any assurance that future political developments in Mexico, over which we have no control, will not have an unfavorable impact on our financial position or results of operations.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, effecting a business combination with a company located in Mexico, or another jurisdiction outside of the United States, could subject us to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations. See the risk factor titled “If we effect a business combination with a company located in Mexico or another foreign jurisdiction, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations” for more information on the risks attendant to acquiring a target business in Mexico. Furthermore, if we determine to acquire a target business located outside of Mexico, the positive aspects of consummating a business combination in Mexico would not be applicable to our business going forward.
 
Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that does not meet one or all of these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire companies that:

• | are fundamentally sound but we believe can achieve better results by leveraging the operating and financial experience of our management team;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we believe are able to innovate through new operational techniques, or where we can drive improved financial performance; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | are established companies with proven business models, strong operations and fundamentals for revenue and earnings growth;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | generate solid free cash flows or have the potential to generate strong, stable and increasing free cash flows;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | have leading, growing or strong industry positioning, or are well positioned to participate as a consolidator in its sector;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | have an experienced management team that can implement growth initiatives with a primary capital injection; and/or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | offer attractive risk-adjusted returns.
--+----------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria our management may deem relevant.

We believe our management team’s extensive contacts, broad industry knowledge and highly regarded experience will yield a robust deal flow from which we may select a target. We will seek to acquire the target on terms and in a manner that leverages our management team’s experience. The potential upside from growth in the target business and an improved capital structure will be weighed against any identified downside risks designed to balance value creation with capital preservation.
 
Effecting a Business Combination
 
We will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose, at which time shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our shareholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of our proposed business combination or allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. Unlike other blank check companies which require shareholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and related redemptions of public shares for cash upon consummation of such initial business combinations, even when a vote is not required by law, we will have the flexibility to avoid such shareholder vote and allow our shareholders to sell their shares pursuant to the SEC’s tender offer rules. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
 
We have until April 16, 2020 to consummate an initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination within such time period, we will redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to applicable law and as further described herein, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. We expect the pro rata redemption price to be approximately $10.00 per public share, without taking into account any interest earned on such funds. However, we cannot assure you that we will in fact be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public shareholders.
 
Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Even though our board of directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our board of directors will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the board of directors when it evaluates the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public shareholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able independently to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
 
We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private units, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
 
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

• | our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our obligation to pay EarlyBirdCapital a fee upon consummation of our initial business combination pursuant to the business combination marketing agreement;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our obligation to redeem or repurchase ordinary shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our outstanding warrants and unit purchase option, and the potential future dilution they represent.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
Employees
 
We have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
 
We have registered our units, ordinary shares and warrants under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. These filings are available to the public via the Internet at the SEC’s website located at http://www.sec.gov. You may also read and copy any document that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s public reference room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. For more information, please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. You may request a copy of our filings with the SEC (excluding exhibits) at no cost by writing or telephoning us at the following address or telephone number:

DD3 Acquisition Corp.
 c/o DD3 Mex Acquisition Corp
 Pedregal 24, 4th Floor
 Colonia Molino del Rey, Del. Miguel Hidalgo
 11040 Mexico City, Mexico
 Tel: +52 (55) 8647-0417
 
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to United States generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.
 
We may be required to have our internal control procedures audited for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act and will remain such for up to five years. However, if our annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period exceeds $1 billion or the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we have elected, under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
