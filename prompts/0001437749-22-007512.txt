General Development of Business
 
We are a water resources development company and agribusiness committed to sustainable water and farming projects in California. We are one of the largest private landowners in the state and control significant water supply, storage and conveyance assets capable of being part of the solution to California’s systemic water challenges.
 
Our main objective is to realize the highest and best use of our land, water, and related infrastructure assets in an environmentally responsible way. Our present activities are focused on managing our assets to meet growing long-term demand for access to sustainable water supplies and agricultural products.
 
We own approximately 45,000 acres of land with high-quality, naturally recharging groundwater resources in three areas of Southern California’s Mojave Desert – the Cadiz Valley (35,000 acres), Danby Dry Lake (2,000 acres), and the Piute Valley (9,000 acres) (“Cadiz Property”). Our properties represent a unique private reserve of lands with vested water rights located in a remote area of eastern San Bernardino County that is at the crossroads of major highway, rail, energy, and water infrastructure supplying and delivering necessary resources to communities in California and across the Western United States. See Item 2. Properties, below.
 
Our properties were primarily assembled by our founders in the early 1980s, relying on NASA imagery that identified a unique desert land position at the base of a vast and topographically diverse Southern California watershed with potential for agricultural and water development. The Cadiz Valley property (“Cadiz Property”) is underlain by extensive, high-quality, naturally recharging groundwater able to support a variety of uses (see “The Cadiz Water Project”, below).
 
We have farmed at the Cadiz Property since the late 1980s relying on naturally recharging fresh groundwater supplies for irrigation. Today, our farming operations at the Cadiz Property (“Cadiz Ranch”) are the largest in San Bernardino County. At the Cadiz Ranch, we are engaged in sustainable agricultural production and through lease arrangements with partners have fruit, vegetable and grain crops in production (see “Description of Business, Sustainable Agricultural Development”, below).
 

    1 

  


While we actively farm certain of our properties, we are aware that California faces systemic water challenges and is not able to safely, sustainably and reliably meet the water needs of all of its communities. We believe that the highest and best use of our assets will be realized by offering a combination of water supply, storage and conveyance projects in complement with the agricultural development at our properties and in ways that are sustainable and responsive to California’s resource needs.
 
We are principally focused on developing the Cadiz Valley Water Conservation, Recovery and Storage Project ("Water Project") at our Cadiz Valley property to help address California’s persistent systemic water challenges and deliver new water access to California communities that presently lack reliable water supplies and infrastructure.  Through management of groundwater at the Cadiz Property, the Water Project would conserve groundwater otherwise used for agriculture to augment supply in California communities in need and utilize capacity available in the managed groundwater aquifer system at Cadiz to bank and store imported water for use in future dry years.
 
The Water Project has completed extensive environmental review in accordance with local, state and federal laws and has secured permits authorizing the management of the groundwater aquifer in Cadiz to make available an average of 50,000 acre-feet of water per year for 50 years to communities off of the Cadiz Property. Permitting has also authorized the storage of imported water in the aquifer system for return in future dry years. The Cadiz aquifer system has the capacity to store up to one million acre-feet of imported water (see "The Cadiz Water Project", below).
 
Several California water providers have expressed interest and executed contracts or option agreements to participate in the Water Project. To deliver conserved water to communities in need or to offer storage, the Water Project must provide conveyance facilities capable of delivering water to and from the Cadiz area for participating water providers (see “Conveyance Pipelines”, below). We own a retired, 30” steel natural gas pipeline (“Northern Pipeline”) that extends 220-miles from California’s Central Valley near the California Aqueduct southeast across Kern and San Bernardino Counties terminating at the Cadiz Property. Engineering and technical assessments indicate that the Northern Pipeline can safely convey 25,000 acre-feet of water in either direction. We also maintain a 99-year lease with the Arizona & California Railroad Company (“ARZC”) to co-locate and construct a 43-mile approximately 55-85” steel water conveyance pipeline (“Southern Pipeline”) within the existing, active railroad right-of-way that intersects the Colorado River Aqueduct (“CRA”), one of Southern California’s primary sources of drinking water in Southern California. The Southern Pipeline is designed to convey up to 75,000 acre-feet per year in either direction. 
 
To utilize the Northern Pipeline for water conveyance related to the Water Project or to construct and operate the Southern Pipeline in coordination with existing water conveyance facilities, we must complete additional permitting and regulatory processes. 
 
    2 

  



We expect to complete any necessary permitting in coordination with any contract to use the facility.
 
We believe implementation of the Water Project and increasing California's access to water conveyance, will help improve water equity for underserved communities, which is a significant challenge facing the state of California as climate change intensifies.
 
Successful Water Project implementation would change the cash flow structure of the Company, which has been historically dominated by agricultural lease and farming returns and debt and equity financing to support our working capital needs, including the development of the Water Project. We believe the implementation of the Water Project could provide a significant source of future cash flow for Company.
 
Our current and future operations also include activities that further our commitments to sustainable stewardship of our land and water resources, good governance and corporate social responsibility. We follow a holistic land management strategy, employ a rigorous environmental policy, and engage with our stakeholders and those impacted by our projects to verify alignment and accountability. More than 30,000 acres of our property are presently managed for conservation, including the reservation of 7,500 acres of our Piute property as a desert tortoise land conservation bank (see “Land Stewardship” and Item 2. Properties, below). We believe these commitments are important investments that will assist in maintenance of sustained stockholder value.
 
Our strategy for implementation of our projects, current status milestones and prospects are outlined in “Description of Business” below.
 
Description of Business
 
Our business is focused on the sustainable development of our land and water assets for their highest and best uses.
 
Our properties and assets offer opportunities for a wide array of activities that could benefit those who lack reliable access to food, water and infrastructure. At present, our development activities are focused on the Cadiz Water Project, sustainable agriculture, and land stewardship.
 
California and the Western U.S. face a persistent challenge in meeting the water needs of all of its residents. While the State of California has recognized a Human Right to Water, competing municipal, agricultural and environmental demands outpace the State’s available supply limiting the ability to deliver on that promise. Recent analysis from the California State Water Resources Control Board estimates that more than 1 million Californians lack reliable access to water and several communities are short of long-term reliable and affordable safe-drinking supply.
 
Southern California receives more than half of its water from three imported water sources: (1) the Colorado River Aqueduct (“CRA”), which delivers water from the Colorado River into California; (2) the California State Water Project (“SWP”), which provides water supplies from Northern California to the central and southern parts of the state; and (3) the Los Angeles Aqueduct, which delivers water from the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains to the City of Los Angeles. Southern California’s water providers and farmers rely on imports from these systems to meet demand, but deliveries from all three into the region are consistently below capacity, even in wet years, due to a combination of regulatory restrictions and the region’s climate variability.
 
    3 

  



Frequent swings between wet and dry years, which has been exacerbated by climate change, challenges California’s traditional supply system and creates an urgent demand for reliable storage and local supply. In 2022, California entered a third year of drought, with reservoirs sitting significantly below capacity and limits imposed on supply available for communities and farmers.
 
Moreover, cyclical drought, climate change, and regulatory restrictions have limited traditional water supply, which has significantly increased the cost of water and water infrastructure over the last decade.
 
The communities hardest hit by these challenges are California’s disadvantaged communities, where limited tax base and median household income reduce the solutions available to address supply, infrastructure or quality concerns.
 
To contribute solutions to California’s water challenges, we are focused on the development of the Water Project.
 
The Cadiz Water Project
 
The Water Project is a public-private partnership with California water agencies that is designed to actively manage the significant aquifer system beneath the Cadiz Property, conserve fresh, high-quality groundwater that is currently lost to high-salinity and evaporation and make available a new water supply for underserved communities in California. The active management of the aquifer system will also support storage of supplemental and imported water to provide additional relief in future dry years.
 
Water Project operations will follow an extensive, state-of-the-art groundwater management plan (see, “Permits & Regulatory Approvals” below) and withdrawals of groundwater will be limited to sustainable amounts that preserve the health of the aquifer system and safeguard the desert ecosystem. An average of 50,000 acre-feet of water per year will be captured and made available for beneficial use in Southern California communities, an amount of annual supply that could serve approximately 400,000 people each year.
 
The Water Project would utilize the managed groundwater basin to offer storage in the aquifer system for up to one-million acre-feet of fresh water that would be imported and held in storage until needed in future dry years. The total storage capacity of the aquifer system is larger than Southern California’s largest surface reservoir, Diamond Valley Lake, and the location of the Cadiz Property approximately 40 miles from the Colorado River Aqueduct make it a desirable site for storage of Colorado River water supplies, which presently are held in surface reservoirs such as Lake Havasu that suffer significant annual evaporative losses.
 
The Water Project was designed on a foundation of scientific study to ensure the sustainability of operations. Several comprehensive studies of the water resources at the Cadiz Property and within the surrounding topographically diverse 1,300 sq. mile watershed have been completed to better understand the extent of the unique resources in the Cadiz Valley, including basin size, capacity, water quality and geology.
 
    4 

  
 

In summary, scientific research and study have demonstrated the following characteristics of the resource:
 

1. | The aquifer underlying the Cadiz Property contains between 17 – 34 million acre-feet of groundwater in storage, a quantity on par with Lake Mead, the U.S.’s largest surface reservoir.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | The aquifer system is composed of highly porous sands and rock allowing groundwater to easily flow. At the Cadiz Property, the groundwater table is reached at approximately 150 feet below ground surface, and fresh water extends over 1,000 feet below ground surface. Agricultural use of groundwater at the Cadiz Property has not resulted in any significant, sustained drawdown of the water table in the Cadiz Valley.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Groundwater enters the watershed as precipitation in the high elevations of the surrounding mountain system, percolates slowly over time downgradient to the Cadiz and Fenner Valleys and exits the system at large dry lake playas (Cadiz & Bristol Dry Lakes) south of the Cadiz Property. Natural recharge is estimated at approximately 32,500 acre-feet per year and physical measurements of evaporation from the dry lake playas are consistent with the recharge estimate.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A combination of existing and new facilities will be required for implementation and operation of the Water Project. Facilities include a wellfield, which would integrate with our existing agricultural wells, a pipeline manifold system, and power facilities to support operation of the wellfield. The Water Project may also include a water treatment facility to meet water quality requirements of our partner agencies. Further, to deliver water to participants in the Water Project or import water for storage at the Project area, at least one water conveyance pipeline would be required either via new construction or conversion of existing pipeline facilities in the area. We currently contemplate the use of two potential pipeline routes for the Water Project; one would extend southwards from the Cadiz Property to the Colorado River Aqueduct in Rice, California (the “Southern Pipeline”) and the other extends northwards from the Cadiz Property to Wheeler Ridge, California (the “Northern Pipeline”). 
 
Construction of the Water Project facilities that would allow for conservation, storage and delivery of groundwater to public water providers is estimated to cost approximately $450 - $550 million. We expect these capital costs to require either infrastructure debt financing secured by the Company in the private markets, capital financing traditionally available to public agencies at a lower cost of capital, or other public funding available to public agencies.
 
We have secured permits required to construct and operate the main Project facilities at the Cadiz Property (see “Permits & Regulatory Approvals”, below).
 
Prior to implementation of the Water Project, we will require final contracts (see “Contracts with Agencies”, below) that will include conveyance arrangements to move water between the Cadiz Property and the service areas of participating water agencies (see “Conveyance Pipelines”, below).  The contracts and conveyance arrangements are subject to environmental review and regulatory approval.
 
    5 

  
 

Permits & Regulatory Approvals
 
To ensure the safety and sustainability of operations, the Water Project requires environmental and regulatory permits prior to construction and implementation. Following a multi-year permitting process, the Water Project received permits that allow the capture and conservation of 2.5 million acre-feet of groundwater over 50 years, on average 50,000 acre-feet per year, and the storage of water in the managed aquifer system, in accordance with the terms of a groundwater management plan approved by San Bernardino County. 
 
The Water Project has completed a California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”) review process including the completion of a comprehensive Final Environmental Impact Report (“FEIR”). The FEIR concluded that Water Project operations would not cause any significant adverse environmental impacts. The FEIR was certified on July 31, 2012.
 
San Bernardino County, the local agency responsible for groundwater use at the Cadiz Property has also reviewed the Water Project and approved its Groundwater Monitoring, Management and Mitigation Plan (‘GMMMP”), which establishes a monitoring network to ensure that the Water Project will not cause harm to the environment or surrounding land uses. The GMMMP includes 100 monitoring features across the watershed and regular transparent disclosure of conditions. The FEIR and GMMMP permits allow the conservation and delivery of 50,000 acre-feet of groundwater per year for 50 years to serve beneficial uses in California communities. These permits were upheld and sustained in their entirety by judgements in California’s Superior and Appellate Courts and are no longer subject to legal challenge.
 
In August 2019, an Addendum to the FEIR was adopted by the Fenner Valley Water Authority, a joint powers authority comprised of the public water agencies participating in the Water Project, to address updates to the Water Project proposal, such as its water treatment program and pipeline route. The Addendum also assessed new studies published about natural springs in the Water Project watershed. The Addendum concluded that there are no significant adverse impacts associated with the minor changes to the Water Project and further summarized that the spring studies did not change the conclusions of the FEIR’s analysis. The Addendum was not challenged in court and is no longer subject to litigation. 
 
Contracts with Water Agencies
 
The Water Project is a public-private partnership with California public water agencies that require supplemental water supply and storage to serve their communities
 
Since 2010 we have executed Letters of Intent (“LOIs”), option agreements, or contracts reserving water supply and storage for public water agencies and private water utilities (“Participating Agencies”) that serve more than one million customers in cities throughout California’s San Bernardino, Riverside, Los Angeles, Orange, Imperial and Ventura Counties. We have pledged that the benefits of the Water Project will be realized locally in San Bernardino County, where the Cadiz Property is located, and twenty percent of Water Project supplies have already been reserved for San Bernardino County-based agencies.
 
    6 

  
 

Generally, our existing contracts and option agreements reserve water supply from the Project at approximately $1,200 - 1,400/ acre-foot of delivered water, and reserve aquifer storage capacity at $1,500/ acre-foot of capacity. 
 
Water supply and storage pricing in the agreements include adjustments in market pricing that have occurred since initial execution of option agreements. We also expect final pricing will include considerations for the service of state-designated disadvantaged communities (“DAC” or “DACs”) by a water provider. All current partners in the Water Project contain at least one community classified as a DAC. It is our objective for the cost of water supply and storage from the Water Project to be among the most affordable solutions in Southern California.
 
In addition to discussions with parties that presently hold options and contracts to water from the Project, we also are engaging in discussions with communities that have been particularly affected by the ongoing drought in California and that may benefit from the availability of supply and storage from the Water Project. Regulatory restrictions on California’s traditional supplies are accelerating these discussions as we aim to service those hardest hit by lack of safe, reliable water access. 
 
Contracts are subject to the approval of the elected boards of the Participating Agencies, or regulatory authority of that agency, and subject to environmental review and compliance with CEQA. Participants may also complete additional study and investigation of the Water Project prior to consideration of a contract. 
 
Conveyance Pipelines
 
As described above, we anticipate using two separate pipeline routes to convey water between the Cadiz Property and the service areas of Participating Agencies. The first route, or the Southern Pipeline, requires the construction of a 43-mile water conveyance pipeline within a portion of the ARZC right-of-way that crosses the Cadiz Property and intersects with the CRA in Rice, California. The CRA is owned by the Metropolitan Water District (“MWD”) and serves water providers in six southern California counties. The second route, or the Northern Pipeline, contemplates the use of an existing, idle 30” natural gas pipeline that we acquired from El Paso Natural Gas (“EPNG”) to convert for water conveyance. The Northern Pipeline extends 220-miles between Wheeler Ridge, California near Bakersfield and the Cadiz Property. Along its route it crosses main water delivery systems including the Mojave River Pipeline, the Los Angeles Aqueduct and facilities of the State Water Project.
 
The use of either route for conveyance of water to or from the Cadiz Property is subject to additional regulatory approval as outlined below.
 
    7 

  



1. | Southern Pipeline
---+------------------

 
The Southern Pipeline is designed to be a 55-85” steel pipeline that would be constructed within ARZC's 200 ft. wide right-of-way traveling from the Cadiz Property 43 miles south-east to the CRA near Rice, California. It would have the capacity to transport up to 150,000 acre-feet per year depending on the diameter of the pipe selected, however our current permits limit the conveyance amount to 75,000 acre-feet per year. In 2008, we entered into a 99-year lease agreement with the ARZC to utilize a portion of its existing right-of-way for a conveyance pipeline and related facilities. As part of the lease arrangement, we agreed to provide necessary railroad improvements in furtherance of railroad purposes. This includes providing water and power to the railroad for fire protection and improving access roads and transloading operations, among other things. By co-locating the conveyance pipeline within this existing railroad right-of-way, Water Project construction would avoid impacts to desert habitats. The route and construction within the route were evaluated and approved during the Water Project’s CEQA permitting process.
 
Our proposed co-location in the right-of-way was also separately assessed by the US Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) to determine the need for any federal permitting related to the proposed use of the ARZC railroad right-of-way, which is a federal right-of-way originally granted to the railroad in accordance with the General Railroad Right-of-Way Act of 1875 ("1875 Act"). BLM’s evaluation, which was issued in February 2020, concluded that the proposed Southern Pipeline will further railroad purposes at least in part, is within the scope of the right-of-way, and requires no additional BLM approvals. In February 2022, the US Department of the Interior’s Solicitor Office issued a new legal opinion regarding third party use of 1875 Act rights-of-way that preserved the railroad purposes assessment for third party uses. The opinion was not specific to any railroad and did not alter our 2020 evaluation.
 
Construction of the Southern Pipeline and related facilities will not be initiated until we obtain both (i) an agreement with Metropolitan Water District of Southern California to move water supplies from the Water Project in the CRA; and (ii) a finding by the California State Lands Commission that conveying water from the Water Project in the CRA will not adversely affect the desert environment.
 

● | MWD Agreement
--+--------------

 Water supplies conserved by the Water Project would enter the CRA, which is owned by MWD, at the termination of the Southern Pipeline. The CEQA process considered a variety of options for the interconnection to the CRA and conveyance of Water Project supplies in the CRA for the benefit of Participating Agencies. Final terms and conditions for entry and conveyance will be determined by MWD in consultation with the Participating Agencies.
 MWD is required to convey water for a third party subject to provisions in California Water Code sections 1810 – 1815, Joint Use of Capacity in Water Conveyance Facilities (also known as “the Wheeling Statutes”) provided that supplies entering the CRA comply with MWD’s published engineering, design and water quality standards. Water supplies conveyed in the CRA are also subject to all applicable fees and charges routinely established by MWD for the conveyance of water within its service territory. Any wheeling fees will be payable by participants in the Water Project.
 


    8 

  

Adding Cadiz groundwater to the CRA offers a water quality benefit to MWD and its member agencies that may also be considered when establishing terms and conditions for entry and conveyance in the CRA. Cadiz water presently meets all state and federal water quality requirements without treatment and total dissolved solids (“TDS”) or salts in the Cadiz water supply are substantially lower than the water in the CRA. Adding Cadiz water to the CRA could lower its TDS and provide a reduction in treatment costs. Some naturally occurring constituents at Cadiz are lower than state and federal drinking water standards, but potentially higher than the water in the CRA; however, based on extensive pilot testing, they can be lowered via treatment to ambient levels or removed entirely with use of cost-effective treatment technologies. 
 
Cadiz aquifer system storage also offers significant benefits to MWD members agencies managing Colorado River entitlements. Water stored at Cadiz would suffer no evaporative losses, while water stored in Colorado River surface reservoirs can experience up to 20% loss due to evaporation due to their Mojave Desert environment.
 
Once agreement regarding terms and conditions of the Water Project’s use of the CRA to transport water to its participating agencies is reached, then the agreement will be considered by the MWD Board. We expect a formal application to MWD for consideration of terms and conditions would be filed in coordination with the completion of our contractual arrangements.
 

● | State Lands Commission Review under Water Code Section 1815
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 
Water Code Section 1815, which is a component of California’s “Wheeling Statutes” referenced above, requires desert groundwater projects to apply for a review by the California State Lands Commission (“SLC”) prior to moving water in facilities like the CRA. This review must determine whether such projects would have “unreasonable effects on the environment and water dependent ecosystems in the surrounding watersheds.” The review by SLC must be conducted within 15 months of any filed application, with an option to extend for an additional 9 months upon public notice and explanation. Any application to the SLC for review of the Water Project’s plans to convey water in the CRA from the Cadiz Property will be accompanied by evidence of the Water Project’s extensive record of environmental sustainability as well as data and reports that we expect will withstand critical scrutiny. We expect a formal application with the SLC would be filed in coordination with final contractual arrangements with Participating Agencies. 
 

2. | Northern Pipeline
---+------------------

 
The Northern Pipeline is a 220-mile long, 30-inch-wide existing idle steel pipeline that extends northwest from our Cadiz Property and crosses agricultural, military, industrial and exurban communities across San Bernardino, Los Angeles, and Kern counties. The pipeline also crosses primary state water infrastructure including the Los Angeles Aqueduct and facilities of the State Water Project.
 
Technical engineering studies have indicated that the pipeline (a former petroleum products line that was retired in 2005) could transport approximately 25,000 acre-feet of water per year between points along the pipeline corridor. Professional water quality and structural testing of a five-mile segment conducted in 2020 determined that there were no residual gas or petroleum products in the tested segment and that the pipeline is structurally sound to transport water.
 
    9 

  


In December 2020, BLM granted to our subsidiary Cadiz Real Estate LLC two right-of-way permits that now enable us to transport water through the entire Northern Pipeline over BLM-managed lands. The first right-of-way was issued pursuant to an assignment in October 2020 of a portion of an existing right-of-way held by EPNG and renewed by BLM under the Mineral Leasing Act that enables the continued transportation of natural gas. The second right-of-way was issued under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and authorizes the conveyance of water in the pipeline over BLM-managed lands. The two right-of-way grants are presently being challenged in federal court.  See Item 3. Legal Proceedings, below.
 
Following receipt of the BLM grants, the Company completed the acquisition of the Northern Pipeline with final payment to EPNG of $19 million, on June 30, 2021. We now own the entire 220-mile pipeline asset in fee. 
 
The Northern Pipeline offers California water purveyors a unique asset and corresponding opportunity to connect available supplies with rural areas of the State that are underserved. When the Northern Pipeline becomes operational for water conveyance, and the Southern Pipeline is built, the Water Project would interconnect all of Southern California’s primary water delivery systems for the first time, enabling more flexible trading among participants on these systems. 
 
We are presently engaged in discussions with parties interested in using the Northern Pipeline for conveyance, storage and supply. The Northern Pipeline crosses a critically dry, rural and underserved part of California and it could directly augment water supply access and storage for 23 state-designated disadvantaged communities along its route.
 
Prior to conveyance of water through the Northern Pipeline, we must secure permits required by any definitive agreement to use the facility. All conveyance of water via the Northern Pipeline would be conducted in accordance with applicable local, state and federal laws.
 
The cost to convert the entire Northern Pipeline for delivery of water is estimated at approximately $100 - $125 million, described in the discussion of Water Project facilities costs above in “Description of Business, the Cadiz Water Project .“ We anticipate that these costs will be financed via infrastructure debt available in the private markets financing or funding accessible by our public agency partners.
 
Facility Design & Construction
 
Prior to final construction of the Water Project facilities, we must finalize facility design and acquire relevant construction permits from local agencies.
 
Together with Participating Agencies we have engaged engineering and environmental consultants to complete design plans for remaining necessary facilities. This work is ongoing and expected to proceed in coordination with the negotiation of contracts and conveyance arrangements.
 
    10 

  


Social Impact
 
Upon implementation, an objective of the Water Project’s safe and sustainable operations is to benefit community stakeholders. The Water Project will have the following positive social impacts:

1. | Water for disadvantaged communities. All public agency participants with options to contract for water from the Water Project must serve at least one disadvantaged community within their service area. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Improve local water quality. The introduction of our low TDS groundwater in the CRA, which is known to be high in TDS, would provide a water softening benefit that would reduce treatment costs for the metropolitan southern California service area. Water Project partners have also established a $5 million fund for small water systems in disadvantaged communities to support local water quality improvements. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Repurposing carbon contributing assets. The use of the Northern Pipeline for water conveyance will convert a former oil and gas pipeline for the beneficial use of water conveyance. The recycling of an existing pipeline will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the load on the state’s current water transportation sources. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Creation of new renewable energy. The Cadiz Southern Pipeline and Northern Pipeline will feature in-line turbines that will generate renewable hydropower. The Water Project wells and pump stations will be powered at least in part by solar energy and natural gas. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Protection of habitats. All Water Project facilities will be built on private lands, disturbed public lands or within existing transportation corridors to avoid any impacts on habitats. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Support stable water rates. The addition of new reliable supply, groundwater storage, improved water quality and system efficiency will allow water agency participants to keep rates low in their service area. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | Create and support good-paying jobs. The Water Project is expected to create and support nearly 6,000 jobs across the local economy during two phases of construction; 10% of jobs are reserved for veterans. We maintain a Project Labor Agreement with two building trades unions to employ their members during all construction of Project facilities. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8. | Improved tax base. Improvements to the Cadiz Project resulting from the Water Project will contribute new tax revenue to local governments, including County budgets and local schools in disadvantaged communities. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sustainable Agricultural Development
 
Farming began at the Cadiz Property in the 1980s and has continued sustainably since that time. Our entire 35,000-acre Cadiz Property is zoned to allow for agricultural development.  A total of 9,600 acres of the property, which is also known as the Cadiz Ranch, has been permitted for agricultural use, allowing for planting, irrigation and related infrastructure. The Cadiz Ranch is the largest approved agricultural operation in San Bernardino County.
 
    11 

  


The property features worker housing and commissary for 300 people, as well as office and equipment facilities. Irrigation is currently supported by 9 wells, with capacity to deliver up to 25,000 acre-feet of water per year. All agricultural wells are expected to be integrated into any Water Project wellfield. Water quality is excellent with very low TDS and meets all state and federal requirements without treatment.
 
Presently, 3,100 acres are developed for farming via a combination of lease arrangements and direct farming by Cadiz as follows: 
 

● | 2,100 acres have been leased for the farming of lemons and other crops by Fenner Valley Farms LLC. Of this total, 640 acres have been developed to lemon orchards. All farming expenses are borne by the lessee. Revenues from this lease total approximately $420,000 per year.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 242 acres have been leased for the farming of industrial hemp by SoCal Hemp JV LLC, our 50/50 joint venture partnership with SoCal HempCo LLC, owned by Glass House Brands, Inc. All farming expenses are borne by the joint venture. Lease revenues received from the joint venture totaled approximately $120,000. Regulatory uncertainty and access supply uncertainty in the CBD market has limited market opportunities for our hemp and the cannabinoids (CBD) derived from harvested hemp to date. Due to limited demand, in 2022 we expect to plant less than 20 acres of hemp focusing on continued hemp and hemp-derived CBD research. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 760 acres have been developed by the Company for alfalfa. 600 of these acres were planted in fall 2021 and the remaining 160 acres have been planted in spring 2022. Initial harvesting is expected to begin in the 2nd quarter of 2022. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
To address climate change, maintain a natural environment and support habitat for local flora and fauna, we and our farming partners follow best practices that minimize water use, improve soil fertility, and reduce pesticides and other applications that could adversely impact soil, water or food quality.
 
All farming at the Cadiz Ranch is conducted in accordance with permits and a management plan overseen by San Bernardino County. We report our crop mix, groundwater use, water quality, well levels, and other trends annually to the County.
 
Efficient use of water by agriculture is critical to long-term sustainability and our agricultural operations. The Cadiz/Fenner groundwater basins, which underlie our farming operations, are classified as “low/very low” priority in accordance with the California Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (“SGMA”) demonstrating the sustainability of the groundwater basins that support our ongoing irrigation. By contrast, the Public Policy Institute of California has estimated that between 535,000 and 750,000 acres of farmland in the Central Valley will have to be permanently fallowed in order for these groundwater basins to satisfy SGMA. Given the enduring safety and sustainability of our agricultural operations, we anticipate offering a continuing option for agricultural operations in California.

All Cadiz Ranch agriculture is developed to be compatible with anticipated Water Project operations. Overlying farming demands will be coordinated with Water Project operations and existing permits to utilize available water for its highest and best use.
 
Land Stewardship
 
Our mission includes managing our desert properties for their highest and best use. Approximately 30,000 acres of our total 45,000 acres are presently managed for permanent open space.
 
In 2014, we permanently dedicated approximately 7,500 acres of our Piute Valley properties to conservation. These properties, which are not associated with the Cadiz Water Project or Cadiz  Ranch agricultural operations, are located within terrain designated by the federal government as Critical Desert Tortoise Habitat and/or Desert Wilderness Areas. In February 2015, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife approved our establishment of the Fenner Valley Desert Tortoise Conservation Bank (“Fenner Bank”), a land conservation bank that makes available these properties for mitigation of impacts to tortoise and other sensitive species that would be caused by any development across the Southern California desert. Under its enabling documents, the Fenner Bank offers credits that can be acquired by entities that must mitigate or offset impacts linked to planned development. For example, this bank can service the mitigation requirements of renewable energy, military, residential and commercial development projects being considered throughout the Mojave Desert. Credits sold by the Fenner Bank are dedicated to funding the permanent preservation of the land by the San Diego Habitat Conservancy and research by San Diego Zoo Global into desert tortoise health and species protection. Any future revenues received from credits sold are expected to be reinvested into the land conservation operation.
 
Other Opportunities
 
We remain committed to the sustainable use of our land, water and infrastructure assets and will continue to explore all opportunities for sustainable development in an environmentally responsible way. We cannot estimate which of these opportunities will ultimately be realized.
Seasonality
 
Our water resource development activities are not seasonal in nature.
 
Farming operations on the leased land at the Cadiz Property include the year-round cultivation of lemons and spring and fall plantings of vegetables and grains. These operations have been subject to general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the agricultural industry.
Competition
 
We face competition in the acquisition, development and sale of water and land assets from a variety of parties. We also experience competition in our development of water projects and agriculture associated with our properties. Since California has scarce water resources and an increasing demand for available water, we believe that location, price and reliability of delivery are the principal competitive factors affecting transfers of water in California. We believe our projects are competitive with other sources of water and agriculture.

Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 10 full-time employees (i.e. those individuals working more than 1,000 hours per year). Our business operations also rely on third party contracted seasonal and temporary workers, as well as consultants and vendors to help augment specialized human capital and talent needs. Our full-time and third party contracted workers, as well as consultants and vendors, must follow our code of conduct and ethics policy, as well as our whistleblower and information security policies. 
 
We appreciate the importance of retention, growth and development of our employees. The average tenure of our full-time employees is more than 10 years, reflecting our positive work environment that offers opportunities to develop new skills and advance to new positions. We believe we offer competitive compensation (including salary, incentive bonus, and equity) and benefits packages to our employees, including a 401(k) plan. Further, we urge professional development opportunities and mentorship to cultivate talent throughout the Company.
 
As a small workforce, we focus on skill sharing and experience diversity in the workplace. Our full-time employees have opportunity to often work with senior leadership and/or Board members in pursuit of business objectives. Management and leadership provide annual reviews of employee performance. Human capital is generally managed by our CEO and CFO, and employment policies are overseen by the Board, particularly the Compensation Committee.
 
We are focused on both executing on a strategy to support progress and evaluating our diversity and inclusion strengths and opportunities to ensure our workforce reflects the communities in which we operate.
 
COVID-19
 
We remained open throughout the COVID-19 pandemic as a member of the agricultural products industry. Our employees were provided opportunities to telework and flexibility to manage the unique demands of the situation. We expect to continue to support work-from-home arrangements for our employees even as the pandemic eases, as it has created new flexibility that is favored by our workforce.
 
Our employees are provided socially-distanced working spaces and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Our operations are also in compliance with all local, state and federal pandemic regulations.

Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to varying degrees of federal, state and local laws and regulations, as detailed throughout Item 1. As we proceed with the development of our properties, including the Water Project, we will be required to demonstrate to various regulatory authorities that we are in compliance with the laws, regulations and policies enforced by such authorities. Groundwater development, and the export of conserved groundwater for sale to entities such as public water agencies, is subject to regulation by specific existing statutes pertaining to water supply, but also general environmental statutes applicable to all forms of development. Agricultural operations are generally subject to regulation by local agencies, such as county governments, as well as state environmental and water statutes. For example, we must obtain a variety of approvals and permits from state and federal governments with respect to assessment of environmental impact, particularly given the location of our assets in the California desert and in proximity to public lands. Because of the discretionary nature of these approvals, concerns raised by governmental officials, public interest groups and/or other interested parties during both the development and the approval process may impact our ability to develop our properties in the manner we believe would fulfill their highest and best use. The realization of income from our projects, including the Water Project, could be delayed, reduced or eliminated based on regulatory restrictions and/or processes.
