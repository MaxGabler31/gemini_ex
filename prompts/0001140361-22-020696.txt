We compete with many manufacturers of heat transfer and HVAC&R products, some of which are divisions of larger companies.  The markets for our products continue to be very dynamic.  Our traditional OEM customers are faced with dramatically increased international competition and have expanded their global manufacturing footprints to compete in local markets.  In addition, consolidation within the supply base and vertical integration have introduced new or restructured competitors to our markets.  Some of these market changes have caused us to experience competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs, lower healthcare costs, and lower tax rates.  Many of our customers also continue to ask us, as well as their other primary suppliers, to provide research and development (“R&D”), design, and validation support for new potential projects.  This combined work effort often results in stronger customer relationships and more partnership opportunities for us.
Business Segments
 
Our chief operating decision maker reviews the separate financial results for each of our operating segments.  These results are used to evaluate the performance of each business segment and for making decisions on the allocation of resources.  Financial information for our operating segments is included in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Effective July 1, 2021, we aligned the data center businesses previously managed by and reported within the CIS segment under the BHVAC segment.  The BHVAC segment assumed management of our business in Guadalajara, Spain and a portion of our business in Grenada, Mississippi.  Through this segment change, we aligned our data center businesses under the same leadership team to accelerate commercial excellence, operational improvements, and organizational efficiencies.
 


 
 Effective April 1, 2022, we began managing our company under two operating segments, Climate Solutions and Performance Technologies.  The Climate Solutions segment includes the BHVAC and CIS segment businesses with the exception of CIS Coatings.  The Performance Technologies segment includes the HDE and Automotive segment businesses and the CIS Coatings business.  Our new structure aligns businesses serving similar or complimentary end markets, products and technologies under common segment management.  We expect this simplified segment structure will allow us to better focus our resources on targeted growth opportunities and more efficiently apply the 80/20 principles across all product lines to optimize profit margins and cash flow.


Building HVAC Systems Segment
 
Market Overview
Our BHVAC businesses in North America serve heating, indoor air quality, and data center markets.  Our businesses in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and in Spain serve data center, air conditioning, and indoor air quality markets in the U.K., mainland Europe, the Middle East, Far East and Africa (“EMEA”).
 
The heating market in North America experienced moderate growth in fiscal 2022.  We expect increasing demands for energy efficiency and decarbonization initiatives will drive additional modest growth in the North American heating markets in fiscal 2023.
 
The North American indoor air quality market experienced strong growth during fiscal 2022, largely driven by an increased focus on and available federal and local funding for ventilation improvements by school and healthcare systems as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  We expect the federal COVID recovery funds for schools to upgrade facilities, including their HVAC systems, will drive continued strong growth in the North American indoor air quality market in fiscal 2023.
 
In fiscal 2022, the data center markets in North America and EMEA experienced strong growth.  We expect continued strong growth in the data center markets in fiscal 2023, driven by the ever-increasing reliance on digital technologies, specifically colocation and cloud usage.  Market demand for data usage and storage continues to rise, driven by the increased use of the IoT (Internet of Things) technology, which connects various devices through the internet, artificial intelligence, smart phones, and digital transformation trends.  Digital transformation trends driving market demand include employers offering remote work arrangements and an increased focus on the digital customer experience, as more transactions and customer interactions are taking place virtually through websites and mobile applications.
 
The indoor air quality and air conditioning markets served by our U.K. business experienced moderate growth in fiscal 2022.  We expect these markets will continue to exhibit moderate growth in fiscal 2023.  Looking forward, we expect that European legislation, designed to increase equipment efficiency and reduce the use of high global warming potential refrigerants, will result in customer buying pattern shifts over the next few years, as HVAC equipment providers shift products towards more efficient and environmentally-friendly alternatives.  We expect commercial investment, construction market activity, and energy efficiency legislation will drive increased demand in the air conditioning and indoor air quality markets in the years to come.

The following summarizes the primary vehicular markets we serve:
 
Commercial Vehicle
 
Market Overview
 During fiscal 2022, the North American and European commercial vehicle markets, particularly for heavy- and medium-duty trucks, experienced strong growth as these markets continued to recover from the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which were most severe during the first half of fiscal 2021.  The commercial vehicle markets in Asia experienced modest declines resulting from cyclical market weakness in fiscal 2022.  Global supply chain challenges and rising inflation pressures began in fiscal 2022 and we expect these challenges will continue in fiscal 2023.
 
In fiscal 2023, we expect overall moderate growth in the global commercial vehicle markets, with the strongest growth expected in North America, as customers work through backlog orders, and Brazil, where we expect strong growth trends influenced by upcoming emission standards.  We expect that the commercial vehicle market in China, however, will moderately decline in fiscal 2023 due to cyclical market weakness and the negative impacts of recent government-required lock-downs and supply chain challenges associated with COVID-19.
 
Trends influencing the commercial and specialty vehicle markets include the continued need by commercial vehicle manufacturers to meet increasingly stringent emissions and fuel consumption requirements in all regions of the world.  For example, Modine has realized incremental business in Asia as China 6 and Bharat Stage 6 regulations have been implemented in China and India, respectively.  Additionally, truck and bus manufacturers are developing and bringing to market alternative powertrains, including battery electric, waste heat recovery, fuel cells, and other hydrogen-based technologies aimed at improving vehicle efficiency and reducing carbon footprint.  These trends are driving the advancement of product development worldwide and are creating demand for incremental improvements to thermal transfer products and systems.  We recently announced availability of our suite of EVantage™ Thermal Management Systems for commercial electric vehicle chassis.  These complete battery thermal management systems regulate battery, traction motor, and power electronics temperatures within optimal ranges under all operating conditions and are customizable for all chassis sizes.  We are producing these systems for several customers, with additional programs launching in fiscal 2023.  We are also engaged in development with prospective customers – both traditional OEMs and start-up companies – on vehicles that cover the full range of commercial vehicle applications from last-mile to Class 8 trucks to transit-, coach and school buses.  We are well positioned to support these exciting changes.

Off-Highway
 
Market Overview
 Overall, global off-highway markets experienced strong growth in fiscal 2022.  The strongest growth was seen within the North and South American and European off-highway markets, including agricultural, construction, and mining markets.  Growth was particularly strong for larger tractor and vehicle applications.  Global supply chain challenges and rising inflation pressures began in fiscal 2022 and we expect these challenges will continue in fiscal 2023.
 
In fiscal 2023, we expect overall moderate growth in the global off-highway markets, with the strongest growth expected in North America, as customers work through backlog orders with limited inventory currently in the supply chain.  We expect that the off-highway market in China, however, will moderately decline in fiscal 2023 due to cyclical market weakness and the negative impacts of recent government-required lock-downs and supply chain challenges associated with COVID-19.
 
We expect wide-scale adoption of alternative powertrains will happen more gradually in the off-highway markets compared with commercial vehicle markets.  However, there are several off-highway customers and applications that are currently active in developing and bringing this technology to market.  We are actively engaged with them and see additional opportunities in the future.
 
Products
 Powertrain cooling (engine cooling modules, radiators, condensers, charge air coolers, fuel coolers and oil coolers); auxiliary cooling (power steering coolers and transmission oil coolers); on-engine cooling (EGR coolers, engine oil coolers, fuel coolers, charge air coolers and intake air coolers); and complete battery thermal management systems and electronics cooling packages.
Customers
 Construction, agricultural, and mining equipment and engine manufacturers, and industrial manufacturers of material handling equipment, generator sets and compressors.
 
Automotive and Light Vehicle
 
Market Overview
 The European, North American and Chinese automotive and light vehicle markets declined during fiscal 2022.  Semiconductor chip shortages and other supply chain challenges resulted in significantly lower global automotive production and contributed to the market declines.  In fiscal 2023, we expect that the limitations associated with semiconductor chip shortages will ease and, as a result, we expect growth in the North American and Chinese automotive and light vehicle markets.  With regard to the European automotive and light vehicle market, we are monitoring the impacts of the military conflict in Ukraine.  We believe the conflict could result in lower automotive production in Europe if supply parts and raw materials for OEMs become less available or if there continues to be a significant impact on energy and fuel availability and prices.
 


 
Overall, we expect that longer-term growth of the global automotive market will be supported by the technology transformation to electric vehicles, tightening of emissions standards for internal combustion engines, in-vehicle technology enhancements and growth in emerging markets.

Our non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates manufacture and sell a number of commercial, industrial and building HVAC&R and vehicular products similar to those produced in the U.S.
 
Exports   Export sales from the U.S. to foreign countries, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, were 7 percent in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020.
 
We believe our international presence positions us to benefit from the anticipated long-term growth of the global commercial, industrial and building HVAC&R and vehicular markets.  We are committed to increasing our involvement and investment in international markets in the years ahead.
  Customer Dependence   Our ten largest customers, some of which are conglomerates or otherwise affiliated with one another, accounted for 39 percent of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022.  In fiscal 2022, our largest customer accounted for less than 10 percent of our sales. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, Daimler AG, which included Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Daimler Truck AG prior to the spin-off of Daimler Truck AG in fiscal 2022, accounted for 10 percent or more of our sales.
 
Our top customers operate primarily in the commercial vehicle, off-highway, automotive and light vehicle, commercial air conditioning and refrigeration markets.  Our top customers, listed alphabetically, include: Carrier; Caterpillar; Daimler Truck AG (including Detroit Diesel, Freightliner, Thomas Built Buses, and Western Star Trucks); Deere & Company; Denso Corporation; Mercedes-Benz Group AG (including AMG, Athlon, and Maybach); Trane Technologies; Volkswagen AG (including Audi, MAN, Porsche, Scania, and Navistar); Volvo Group (including Mack Trucks and Renault Trucks); and ZF Friedrichshafen AG.  Generally, we supply products to our customers on the basis of individual purchase orders received from them.  When it is in the mutual interest of Modine and our customers, we utilize long-term sales agreements to minimize investment risks and provide the customer with a proven source of competitively-priced products.  These contracts are typically three to five years in duration.
 


 
Backlog of Orders   Our operating segments maintain their own inventories and production schedules.  We believe that our current production capacity is capable of handling our expected sales volume in fiscal 2023 and beyond.
 
Raw Materials
  We purchase aluminum, nickel and steel from several domestic and foreign suppliers.  In general, we do not rely on any one supplier for these materials, which are, for the most part, available from numerous sources in quantities required by us.  The supply of copper and brass material is concentrated between two global suppliers, with other suppliers qualified and supplying lesser amounts to mitigate risk.  While our suppliers may become constrained due to global demand, we typically do not experience raw material shortages and believe that our suppliers’ production of these metals will be adequate throughout the next fiscal year.  We typically adjust metals pricing with our raw material suppliers on a monthly basis and our major fabricated component suppliers on a quarterly basis.  When possible, we have included provisions within our long-term customer contracts which provide for adjustments to customer prices, on a prospective basis, based upon increases and decreases in the cost of key raw materials.  When applicable, however, these contract provisions are typically limited to the underlying cost of the material based upon the London Metal Exchange, and do not include related premiums or fabrication costs.  In addition, there can often be a three-month to one-year lag until the time that the price adjustments take effect.
 
Patents and other Intellectual Property   We protect our intellectual property through patents, trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights.  As a part of our ongoing R&D activities, we routinely seek patents on new products and processes.  Our Patent Review Committee manages our intellectual property strategy and portfolio.  We own or license numerous patents related to our products and operations.  Also, because we have many product lines, we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses.  We consider each of our patents, trademarks, and licenses to be of value and aggressively defend our rights throughout the world against infringement.  We have over 500 active patents and pending patent applications worldwide.
 
Research and Development   We are committed to creating value through technology and innovation.  We focus our engineering and R&D efforts on solutions that meet challenging heat transfer needs of OEMs and other customers within the commercial, industrial, and building HVAC&R and commercial vehicle, construction, agricultural, powersports and automotive and light vehicle markets.  Our products and systems are often aimed at solving difficult and complex heat transfer challenges requiring advanced thermal management.  Typical market demands are for products and systems that are more efficient, lighter weight, more compact, and more durable to meet customer standards as customers work to ensure compliance with increasingly stringent energy efficiency and emissions requirements.  Our heritage includes a depth and breadth of expertise in thermal management that, combined with our global manufacturing presence, standardized processes, and state-of-the-art technical resources, enables us to rapidly bring customized solutions to our customers.
 
R&D expenditures, including certain application engineering costs for specific customer solutions, totaled $50 million, $46 million, and $60 million in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.  As a percentage of our consolidated net sales, we spent approximately 2 percent on R&D in fiscal 2022 and approximately 3 percent in both fiscal 2021 and 2020.  As our key markets continue to change, we are committed to meaningful R&D investment in the years to come.  To achieve efficiencies and lower development costs, our R&D groups work closely with our customers on special projects and system designs.  These development projects focus on advancements in refrigerant heat exchangers, chillers, adiabatic gas coolers, remote condensers, unit coolers, fluid coolers, corrosion resistant coatings, and within our data center business, CRAH units and fan walls.  Vehicular-related projects include EGR technology, oil coolers, charge air coolers, and battery thermal management systems for commercial vehicle, agriculture, construction, and automotive and light vehicle markets.

Environmental Matters
 
We are committed to engineering a cleaner, healthier world by preventing pollution, eliminating waste and reducing environmental risks and employ waste management programs to advance our environmental stewardship and minimize our environmental footprint.  The majority of our facilities maintain Environmental Management System (“EMS”) certification to the international ISO14001 standard through independent third-party audits.
 
We are focused on reducing both our energy and water usage and have empowered each of our global facilities to create and carry out action plans that contribute to our company-wide reduction goals.  Examples of steps we are taking to meet these goals include the installation of more efficient LED lighting systems, the replacement of inefficient boilers and air compressors, improved building HVAC management systems, increased industrial water recycling, and the installation of water-saving faucets.
 
We are committed to continuously driving energy efficiency across our product portfolio, reflecting our sense of environmental responsibility.  For our data center customers, we are focused on designing and providing cooling solutions that reduce both electrical and water usage.  We are also shifting our product portfolios in our industrial businesses toward lower-emission propellants and refrigerants that greatly reduce the environmental impact and enhance energy efficiency for our customers’ heating and cooling systems.  In addition, we are focusing on reducing energy use by recycling waste heat produced from air conditioning systems.  Lastly, products in our vehicular businesses include oil, charge-air, and EGR coolers, radiators, air conditioning condensers, and battery thermal management systems for cars, trucks, buses, specialty vehicles, and off-highway equipment.  These products allow both internal combustion and electric vehicle systems to run at optimal temperatures, which promotes better fuel efficiency, lower emissions, and improved vehicle lifespans.  We continue to focus on product design and development to improve fuel efficiency and reduce overall energy consumption, while still providing the vehicle performance that our customers expect.
 
Obligations for remedial activities may arise at our facilities due to past practices, or as a result of a property purchase or sale.  These obligations most often relate to sites where past operations followed practices that were considered acceptable under then-existing regulations, but now require investigative and/or remedial work to ensure appropriate environmental protection or where we are a successor to the obligations of prior owners and current laws and regulations require investigative and/or remedial work to ensure sufficient environmental compliance.  Liabilities for environmental investigative work and remediation at sites in the U.S. and abroad totaled $18 million at March 31, 2022.
 


 
Seasonal Nature of Business
 Our overall operating performance is generally not subject to a significant degree of seasonality.  Both our BHVAC and CIS segments experience some seasonality, as demand for HVAC&R products can be affected by heating and cooling seasons, weather patterns, construction, and other factors.  Sales volume within the BHVAC segment is generally stronger in our second and third fiscal quarters, corresponding with demand for heating products.  We generally expect sales volume within our CIS segment to be higher during our first and second fiscal quarters due to the construction seasons in the northern hemisphere.  Sales to vehicular OEM customers are dependent upon market demand for new vehicles.  However, our second fiscal quarter production schedules are typically impacted by customer summer shutdowns and our third fiscal quarter is affected by holiday schedules.

Working Capital   We manufacture products for the majority of customers in our CIS, HDE, and Automotive segments on an as-ordered basis, which makes large inventories of finished products unnecessary.  In Brazil, within our HDE segment, we maintain aftermarket product inventory in order to timely meet customer needs in the Brazilian automotive and commercial vehicle aftermarkets.  In our BHVAC segment, we maintain varying levels of finished goods inventory due to seasonal demand and the timing of sales programs.  We have not experienced a significant number of returned products within any of our operating segments.

 We are committed to a diverse workforce, founded on respect and value for people of different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.  Incorporating diverse talent and fostering an inclusive workforce is a key focus of our talent management strategy.  We track and focus on indicators of diversity and inclusion across our global operations, including the number of women in supervisory roles and minority new hires in the U.S.
Competitive Compensation and Benefits
 We offer our employees competitive compensation and comprehensive benefit packages.

We believe that our compensation and employee benefits are competitive and allow us to attract and retain talent throughout our organization.
