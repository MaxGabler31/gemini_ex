 Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering a new class of complement medicines designed to stop the classical complement pathway at its start, C1q, in order to bring therapies to patients suffering from serious complement-mediated autoimmune, neurodegenerative and ophthalmic disorders. C1q, the initiating molecule of the classical complement pathway, is a core component to the body’s immune system that activates a powerful inflammatory cascade. We believe that by stopping the classical complement pathway at its start, our approach may have the potential to provide more complete protection against complement-mediated disorders of the body, brain and eye.
 Our proprietary platform leverages well-researched classical complement-mediated autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease processes, both of which are triggered by aberrant activation of C1q. Evidence suggests that potent and selective inhibition of C1q can prevent tissue damage triggered in antibody-mediated autoimmune disease and preserve loss of functioning synapses associated with cognitive and functional decline in complement-mediated neurodegeneration. By taking an upstream complement approach targeting C1q, our treatments are designed to act as an “on/off switch” to block all downstream components of the classical complement pathway that lead to excess inflammation, tissue damage and patient disability in a host of complement-mediated disorders, while preserving the normal immune function of the lectin and alternative complement pathways involved in the clearance of pathogens and damaged cells. 
 We are advancing a broad pipeline of product candidates designed to block the activity of C1q and the entire classical complement pathway for a range of complement-mediated diseases. Our development strategy is focused on areas where C1q and the classical complement pathway is the key driver of disease. Our pipeline includes three clinical-stage assets across three therapeutic franchises:
  
• | Autoimmune. We are advancing our lead candidate, ANX005, an investigational, full-length monoclonal antibody formulated for intravenous administration for several autoimmune indications. ANX005 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial for the potential treatment of patients with Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) with data anticipated in 2023 and a Phase 2 trial in patients with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) with data anticipated in the second half of 2022. Our ANX009 clinical candidate is a subcutaneous formulation of an antigen-binding fragment, or Fab. ANX009 has been evaluated in a Phase 1 trial and based on the data from this trial, we plan to advance ANX009 into a Phase 1b trial in patients with lupus nephritis (LN) with initial data expected in the second half of 2022.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Neurodegeneration. We are also developing ANX005 for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative indications. ANX005 is currently being evaluated in Phase 2 trials in Huntington’s disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Interim data from the HD trial showed improvements in clinical measures and that ANX005 had been generally well tolerated. We plan to present the full data from our HD trial in the second quarter of 2022. Data from Phase 2 trial of ANX005 in patients with ALS is expected to be reported in 2023.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ophthalmology. Our ANX007 program is a Fab formulated for intravitreal administration for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases of the eye. We are currently conducting a Phase 2 trial in patients with geographic atrophy (GA) with data expected in 2023.

Beyond our clinical-stage assets, our preclinical portfolio of next generation product candidates includes ANX105, an investigational monoclonal antibody targeting neurodegenerative indications, and ANX1502, an investigational oral small molecule in development for the treatment of certain autoimmune indications. Based on learnings from our initial trials and our expertise in the role of C1q and the classical complement pathway, we are evaluating additional orphan and large market indications that are driven by aberrant or excess classical complement activation.
 Our Company was co-founded by the late Dr. Ben Barres, former member of the National Academy of Sciences, Chair of Neurobiology at Stanford University and a pioneer in complement-mediated neurodegeneration, and Dr. Arnon Rosenthal, a world-renowned scientist and industry executive. We have assembled a seasoned and accomplished management team that has been involved in the discovery, development, approval and commercialization of numerous marketed drugs, and has been studying the complement pathway and autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders for decades. Our team is further supported by an experienced scientific advisory board, board of directors, and leading healthcare investors that share our commitment to advancing transformative medicines for patients suffering from debilitating autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases.
 We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights, including through exclusive licenses, to all of our product candidates, which allows us to strategically maximize value from our product portfolio over time. Our patent portfolio includes patent protection for our upstream complement platform and each of our product candidates.
 Our Pipeline
 Our pipeline is focused on antibody-mediated autoimmune and complement-mediated neurodegenerative disorders for which there is significant unmet medical need. Our product candidates are summarized below:
 
Our first clinical-stage product candidate is ANX005, an investigational monoclonal antibody designed to block C1q and activation of the classical complement cascade. For GBS, ANX005 is designed to act early in the disease course to prevent nerve damage and irreversible neurological disability in GBS patients. In the Phase 1b dose-ranging trial in GBS patients, treatment with ANX005 was well-tolerated and resulted in full and prolonged C1q engagement and classical cascade inhibition in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. While our Phase 1b trial was not powered to show statistical significance, we did observe a significant reduction in neurofilament light chain, or NfL, a well-accepted marker of nerve damage in neurodegenerative disease that has been shown to correlate with disease severity and clinical outcomes. Patients treated with ANX005 also showed positive numerical trends across key GBS outcome measures. GBS is a rare, acute, antibody-mediated autoimmune disease impacting the peripheral nervous system. There are currently no approved therapies for GBS in the United States, but intravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIg, and plasma exchange are the current standards of care in the Western world and parts of Asia. 
 7


In March 2021, we completed the evaluation of our drug-drug interaction, or DDI, study of ANX005 co-administered with Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) in 14 patients with GBS. The DDI study was conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ANX005 and IVIg co-administration in GBS patients, and measured pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ANX005 when administered in combination with IVIg. IVIg, though not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States for GBS, is currently the standard of care for GBS. Results from the DDI study demonstrated that co-administration of IVIg-ANX005 was well-tolerated and achieved full C1q target engagement, and C1q suppression was maintained within the targeted range. The open-label DDI study was not placebo-controlled or powered for statistical significance on efficacy measures. Several key GBS outcome measures were recorded from baseline, and early improvement was observed in GBS patients, including increased muscle strength, decreased neurofilament light chain (NfL) and improved GBS disability score. Results from the DDI study were presented at the Peripheral Nerve Society in 2021.
 A randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 trial of ANX005 is ongoing in GBS patients in developing countries and we plan to release data from this trial in 2023. The Phase 2/3 trial is statistically powered to evaluate the efficacy of ANX005 in improving disability in GBS patients. ANX005 has received both Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the FDA for the treatment of GBS.
 Beyond GBS, we are evaluating ANX005 in patients with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or wAIHA, an antibody-mediated autoimmune disease characterized by the premature destruction of red blood cells. The classical complement pathway plays an important role in wAIHA through the removal of red blood cells labeled by activated complement components in the spleen or liver (extra-vascular hemolysis) and less common destruction of red blood cells in the blood vessels by the classical complement generated membrane attack complex (intravascular hemolysis). We initiated a Phase 2 trial in patients with the primary diagnosis of wAIHA in 2021. We are conducting a non-interventional screening study in wAIHA patients to utilize complement activation markers to identify and select patients who may be more likely to respond to our anti-C1q therapy in the Phase 2 trial. We plan to report data from this trial in the second half of 2022.
 We are also studying ANX005 in patients with HD as well as patients with ALS – two neurodegenerative disorders in which aberrant classical complement activation has been shown to be associated with synapse loss, elevated levels of NfL and disease progression. Phase 2 trials evaluating ANX005 in patients with HD and ALS are ongoing, each designed to assess ANX005’s safety, tolerability, target engagement and impact on disease-related biomarkers and clinical outcomes. In January 2022, we announced interim data from the HD trial from patients who completed the 24-week treatment period. Interim data showed that as of a safety cutoff date of October 17, 2021, treatment with ANX005 has been generally well-tolerated, with full target engagement of C1q in both serum and CSF observed through the dosing period as of a cutoff date of December 14, 2021. Evaluable patients maintained clinical function, as measured by changes in mean Composite Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (cUHDRS), relative to baseline after six months of treatment, and improvement in cUHDRS was observed in more than half of all evaluable patients and in 75% of evaluable patients who showed excess complement activity at baseline. NfL levels observed after six months of treatment remained generally consistent and were comparable to NfL levels described in published natural history data for HD patients. We currently anticipate reporting full data from all patients treated, including data from the three-month follow-up period, in the second quarter of 2022. The ALS trial is ongoing and we plan to report data in 2023.
 Our second clinical-stage product candidate is ANX007, an investigational C1q Fab designed for intravitreal administration in patients with complement-mediated neurodegenerative ophthalmic disorders. Consistent with the results we observed in preclinical studies, in the Phase 1b trial with intravitreal administration in glaucoma patients, ANX007 was well-tolerated and showed full target engagement and inhibition of C1q in the eye for at least four weeks. We believe inhibition of C1q may provide neuroprotective benefit by preventing the aberrant loss of functioning synapses in the retina in a variety of ophthalmic disorders, including glaucoma and geographic atrophy, or GA. A Phase 2 trial of ANX007 in patients with GA is ongoing, with the goal of protecting against the loss of photoreceptor neurons in a well-defined patient population. We plan to report data from this trial in 2023.
 Our third clinical-stage product candidate is ANX009, an investigational C1q Fab designed for subcutaneous delivery, which was evaluated in a first-in-human, or FIH, clinical trial. In this trial, ANX009 was well-tolerated at all dose levels tested and no drug-related safety signals were observed. The trial showed that ANX009 led to sustained C1q inhibition at multiple doses, supporting the potential for twice weekly subcutaneous administration with the 
 8


current formulation. We are developing ANX009 to potentially enable chronic dosing for patients with antibody-mediated autoimmune disorders where anti-C1q may have a disease-modifying effect and where we can utilize our targeted biomarker-driven approach. These disorders may include autoimmune hemolytic anemias and a subset of lupus nephritis patients who are selected for pathogenic anti-C1q antibodies, or PACA, and who have a high risk of renal flare. 
 We are developing additional next-generation product candidates, including ANX105, an investigational monoclonal antibody with enhanced dosing and PK properties designed for chronic neurodegenerative diseases, and ANX1502, an oral small molecule being developed for certain autoimmune indications. We intend to initiate a FIH trial of ANX105 in the first half of 2022, with data anticipated in 2023. We intend to initiate a FIH trial of ANX1502 in the second half of 2022, with data expected in 2023.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to develop disease-modifying medicines for patients suffering from classical complement-mediated diseases. Key elements of our strategy include:
  
• | Leveraging our distinct approach of inhibiting C1q and aberrant upstream classical complement activity to address a broad range of well-characterized classical complement-mediated diseases. By inhibiting C1q and the early classical cascade, we believe our product candidates are uniquely designed to address a wide range of antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases and complement-mediated neurodegenerative disorders. We believe full classical complement inhibition may result in clinical benefits by blocking aberrant upstream immune cell activation in our targeted indications, as well as potentially provide safety advantages by leaving the lectin and alternative pathways intact to perform their normal immune functions. We believe our clinical-stage product candidates, ANX005, ANX007 and ANX009 are the first and leading clinical-stage product candidates designed to inhibit C1q and the entire classical complement pathway.

• | Advancing ANX005 through clinical development in multiple autoimmune and neurodegenerative indications of high unmet need. We are developing ANX005 as a potential treatment for GBS, HD, ALS and wAIHA. Our Phase 1b trial in patients with GBS demonstrated full target engagement of C1q in serum and the CSF, as well as a significant reduction in NfL, a well-accepted biomarker shown to be elevated in patients with GBS, HD and ALS and correlated with disease severity and clinical course and outcomes and is now in a Phase 2/3 trial. ANX005 is also being evaluated in ongoing Phase 2 trials in patients with HD, ALS and wAIHA. Interim data from the Phase 2 trial in HD patients showed meaningful improvements in clinical measures of disease and was generally well-tolerated.

• | Evaluating ANX007 as an agent for neuroprotective benefit in ophthalmic indications. We are developing ANX007 in neurodegenerative ophthalmic indications, such as glaucoma and GA. ANX007 reduced retinal damage in animal models of glaucoma and GA. In our Phase 1b trial in glaucoma patients, intravitreal administration of ANX007 resulted in full target engagement of C1q at both low and high doses. Based on this clinical dosing data, our preclinical data in glaucoma and GA, and proximate clinical validation from downstream complement approaches, we believe that ANX007 may provide neuroprotective benefit in patients with these and other complement-mediated ophthalmic disorders. ANX007 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 trial in patients with GA.

• | Expanding our autoimmune and neurodegenerative portfolios informed by data from our beachhead indications. Our initial indications represent our beachhead within antibody-mediated autoimmune and complement-mediated neurodegenerative diseases. We intend to leverage learnings from our initial indications to inform selection of additional orphan and larger patient populations involving related biological mechanisms. In our autoimmune portfolio, potential indications include antibody-mediated autoimmune disorders such as wAIHA, Cold Agglutinin Disease, or CAD, multifocal motor neuropathy, and lupus nephritis, (specifically in lupus nephritis patients with endogenous PACA). In our neurodegenerative portfolio, potential indications include complement-mediated neurodegeneration disorders in the eye and brain such as glaucoma, GA, HD, ALS, frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. We plan to efficiently prosecute these broad opportunities utilizing our disciplined, biomarker-driven development strategy.

We are developing product candidates, such as ANX009, to modulate the classical pathway with the potential to become tailored therapeutics for a large range of indications using different molecular modalities, dosing regimens and tissue localization strategies. In addition, we are developing next generation product candidates, including ANX105, an investigational monoclonal antibody, and ANX1502, an investigational oral small molecule in development for the treatment of certain autoimmune indications.

 Overview of the Complement System and C1q Biology
 The Complement System—three main complement pathways
 The complement system is an integral component of the immune system that consists of many circulating and locally-produced molecules. This system evolved to enhance, or complement, other components of the adaptive and innate immune systems. The complement system, also known as the complement cascade, rapidly responds to pathogens, damaged cells and unwanted tissue components to facilitate their removal by the immune system.
 There are three main complement pathways (also called cascades)—the classical, lectin and alternative pathways. Each pathway is initiated by different molecules that respond to distinct triggers. When activated, the initiating molecules set in motion a cascade of enzymatic reactions that greatly amplify, or complement, an inflammatory response. The classical pathway is initiated by C1q, which recognizes antibody complexes, specific pathogens, damaged cells or unwanted cellular components. The lectin pathway is triggered by carbohydrates on the surface of pathogens or cells. The alternative pathway amplifies the action of the other two pathways and also self-activates to eliminate pathogens or cells that are not specifically shielded by the body’s built-in self-protective systems. While these three pathways are initiated by distinct molecules, they converge downstream on common pathway components known as C3 and C5.
 The three main pathways of the complement cascade are activated by independent molecules but converge at C3
 
Aberrant activation of the complement system can result in a range of diseases characterized by an attack on healthy tissue, such as red blood cells, nerve cells or kidney components. A broad range of diseases are known to be associated with pathological activation of the complement cascade, including antibody-mediated autoimmune disorders such as GBS, wAIHA, CAD and lupus nephritis, and complement-mediated neurodegeneration disorders in 
 10


the eye and brain such as glaucoma, GA, HD, ALS, frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. We believe intervening in the activation of the complement cascade offers a potent and selective mechanism for specifically slowing or reversing these disease processes.
 Specific activated components of the complement cascade have important immune functions that contribute to three key outcomes:
  
• | Immune cell recruitment and inflammation. Specific activated molecules from the cascade serve as soluble signals to make blood vessels leaky and attract immune cells into tissues.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Directed immune cell attack. Several complement components, including C1q, bind directly to the pathogen and serve as receptors that direct immune cell attack and pathogen engulfment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Membrane damage. Downstream components of the cascade directly puncture the pathogen or cell surface, causing membrane damage and lysis.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Aberrant activation of the initiating molecule, C1q, can lead to three main outcomes
 
Inhibiting C1q upstream blocks downstream components and functional activities of the classical complement cascade
 Broad potential for Classical Complement pathway targeted therapeutics in Autoimmune and Neurodegenerative Diseases
 The classical complement cascade has a well-established role in augmenting antibody function within the immune system. C1q recognizes antibodies bound to pathogens or cells and activates the classical pathway to trigger their removal and clearance by the immune system. C1q can also directly recognize pathogens, damaged cells or unwanted cellular components leading to similar downstream clearance. A more recent finding made by the laboratory of Dr. Ben Barres, our scientific founder, is that C1q also directly interacts with neuronal connections, or synapses, during early development. Recognition of weaker synapses by C1q triggers the classical complement cascade and directs immune cells to “prune” the synapses away from neurons, thereby reinforcing stronger synapses to establish appropriate neuronal connections.
 Because of its central role in immune function, aberrant activation of C1q can lead to damage of healthy tissue and destruction of functioning synapses. We are focused on two distinct disease processes involving C1q as a key mediator of tissue damage: antibody-mediated autoimmune disease and complement-mediated neurodegeneration.
 11



In antibody-mediated autoimmune disease, self-reactive antibodies bind to cells or tissues, activating C1q and leading to damaging inflammatory responses. We have observed that inhibition of C1q was protective in several animal models of antibody-mediated autoimmune disease, including neuromyelitis optica, or NMO, and two variants of GBS. In NMO, auto-antibodies recognize cells within the central nervous system, or CNS, and can lead to rapid localized destruction of the optic nerve and regions of the spinal cord, while in GBS pathogenic antibodies react with components of the peripheral nerve system, or PNS, to cause widespread peripheral nerve damage and paralysis. This disease process is also evident in antibody-mediated autoimmune disease involving blood components, such as wAIHA and CAD, characterized by auto-reactive antibodies that trigger destruction of red blood cells, and systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE, where endogenous pathogenic antibodies against C1q itself drive aberrant C1q activation and are highly associated with kidney damage, or lupus nephritis.
 In complement-mediated neurodegeneration, aberrant activation of C1q at synapses in aging and disease can lead to excessive synapse loss and neuronal damage, driving disease progression in multiple neurodegenerative disorders regardless of the initiating factor. In animal models, C1q accumulated on synapses with age, building up to 300-fold higher levels than in younger animals. It did not activate with normal aging, but other inflammatory stimuli, including misfolded proteins, metabolic dysfunction or increases in intraocular pressure, appeared to aberrantly reactivate C1q’s developmental role in synapse elimination. Complement activation and aberrant synapse pruning in disease may lead to neuroinflammation, loss of synaptic neuronal connections and neurodegeneration. In support of this hypothesis, we and other investigators have observed that C1q inhibition was protective in numerous models of neurodegenerative disease, including diseases of the eye, such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration, chronic diseases of the CNS, such as frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer’s, HD and Spinal Muscular Atrophy, or SMA, and acute injury, such as traumatic brain injury and stroke.
 12


Synaptic loss is a pathogenic driver of disability in many neurodegenerative diseases, protected with C1q inhibition
 
Our differentiated approach to treating complement-mediated autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease through inhibition of C1q
 We believe that in order to selectively inhibit aberrant activation of the classical complement pathway implicated in driving certain complement-mediated autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, it is important to target the early components of the classical cascade, particularly C1q, C4 and C3. Activated fragments of C4 and C3 induce vascular leakiness and immune cell recruitment into the tissue, while other fragments of C4 and C3, as well as C1q, work together to direct immune cell attack to the cell or synapse surface. Furthermore, C1q inhibition blocks downstream classical pathway activation of C5 and its membrane damaging effects. We believe that inhibition of C1q does not block the activity of these components in the lectin or alternative complement pathways, and both of these pathways will continue to perform their normal immune functions.
 Our Platform
 Our novel upstream complement platform is designed to completely inhibit classical complement activity for the treatment of antibody-mediated autoimmune disease and complement-mediated neurodegeneration. We believe there are potential advantages to our approach of upstream inhibition of the classical complement cascade, which include:
  
• | Full inhibition of the classical cascade while preserving healthy immune function of the other complement pathways. Inhibition of C1q fully inhibits the classical cascade, including components downstream of C1q such as C4, C3, C5 and the downstream membrane attack complex. As a result, we believe our approach is designed to block all classical complement activity that can contribute to disease pathology, including immune cell recruitment, directed immune cell attack and membrane damage. By targeting upstream tissue-damaging components of the classical complement pathway, our approach leaves the lectin and alternative pathways to perform their normal immune function, which may aide both clinical improvement and safety. Our approach is also distinct from inhibiting C3 or C5. Inhibition of C5 will not affect the upstream components of the classical pathway involved in pathology (C1q, C4 and C3), while inhibition of C3 will block downstream components in all three complement pathways.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 13


 
• | Broad applicability across many indications. We believe our approach has broad utility for the treatment of diseases in which full inhibition of the entire classical complement cascade may be beneficial. We believe our approach is distinguishable from those that target only downstream complement components. Our initial indications represent our beachhead within antibody-mediated autoimmune and complement-mediated neurodegenerative diseases, and we will selectively pursue both orphan and larger patient population diseases with clear biological evidence of classical complement activation. We are also developing novel product candidates targeting C1q and early components of the classical complement cascade, and will utilize different modalities to target these components of the classical complement pathway.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Disciplined, biomarker-driven development strategy for our product candidates. We are deploying a disciplined, biomarker-driven development strategy designed to establish confidence that our product candidates are engaging the specific target at a well-tolerated therapeutic dose in the intended patient tissue. We design small, early-stage clinical trials to rigorously evaluate our product candidates using target engagement and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. We are utilizing sensitive, specific assays for C1q and activation of downstream classical complement components to evaluate target engagement in patient tissues that are most relevant for the diseases that we are treating. We believe that this strategy allows us to make rational decisions regarding our therapeutic pipeline, increasing the probability of technical success over shorter development timelines.

Our Pipeline
 Our pipeline is focused on antibody-mediated autoimmune and complement-mediated neurodegenerative disorders for which there is significant unmet medical need. Our product candidates are summarized in the table below.
Our First Product Candidate, ANX005
 ANX005 is an investigational humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody that is designed to potently bind and inhibit C1q. We have completed a Phase 1b clinical trial for ANX005 in patients with GBS in which ANX005 was well-tolerated and achieved full target engagement and C1q suppression in the PNS and CNS. Based on the results from our Phase 1b trial, we are now evaluating ANX005 in a Phase 2/3 trial in patients with GBS and Phase 2 trials in HD, ALS and wAIHA. ANX005 has been granted Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the FDA for the treatment of GBS.

ANX005 for the Treatment of GBS
 Overview of Guillain-Barré Syndrome
 GBS is a severe acute inflammatory disease typically triggered by a preceding infection, in which aberrant auto-antibodies that recognize neurons or associated cells cause neuronal injury and acute paralytic neuropathy. In 2011, the estimated annual incidence of GBS was approximately 12,000 in North America and Europe. In 2004, the annual economic cost of GBS in the United States was $1.7 billion, largely due to the permanent disability and mortality it can cause.
 There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of GBS. Treatment guidelines published by the American Academy of Neurology recommend early initiation of IVIg or plasma exchange in patients diagnosed with GBS. IVIg and plasma exchange are the established standards of care in the Western world and parts of Asia. Although IVIg and plasma exchange have been shown to provide some benefit, significant unmet need still exists, and many patients, despite receiving the standard of care, are left with residual neurological disability, accompanied by chronic pain and fatigue.
 The clinical course of GBS usually involves rapidly progressive weakness in the limbs culminating in neuromuscular paralysis within two to four weeks of onset. According to 2011 estimates, 20 to 30 percent of patients require mechanical ventilation, over 20 percent have permanent motor or sensory disability and 2 to 17 percent of cases result in death globally. Many patients with GBS require extensive monitoring and supportive care and will seek treatment in a hospital within a few days of onset of the disease. Because approximately a quarter of patients need artificial ventilation due to respiratory muscle weakness, and many develop autonomic disturbances, admission in an intensive care unit is frequently necessary. Symptoms peak within four weeks as the auto-antibody response declines, followed by a recovery period that can last months or years, as the nervous system repairs itself.
 C1q is a key driver of pathogenesis in GBS
 GBS is an acute, autoimmune disease driven by antibodies that lead to activation of the classical complement cascade. Pathological nerve-targeting auto-antibodies, which may be triggered by an infection, lead to the activation of C1q and the classical complement cascade. Studies have shown that pathogenic auto-antibodies are present in the serum and CSF and that activated components of the complement cascade are deposited on peripheral nerve tissue from GBS patients. Peripheral nerve roots are immersed in CSF as they emerge from the spinal cord and are prominent sites of damage in GBS. The figure below illustrates the activation of the classical complement pathway within peripheral nerves in a GBS patient. The left image shows a low magnification view of a peripheral nerve from a GBS patient with numerous individual nerve fibers coated with membrane-damaging complement activation products (C5b-9; dark staining). The middle image shows a high magnification view of an individual nerve fiber with deposition of C3d (dark staining), a complement activation product that directs immune cell attack. The right image shows a highpower image of an individual nerve fiber being probed by an infiltrating immune cell (macrophage).
 

We believe that by blocking the activity of C1q early in the onset of the disease, we can minimize the neuronal damage caused by these pathogenic auto-antibodies, in turn reducing the patients’ symptoms and accelerating their neurological recovery.
 15


Neurofilament light chain (NfL), a marker of neurodegeneration, is highly elevated in GBS
 NfL, an intracellular neuron-specific protein, has emerged as a well-accepted biomarker of nerve damage in disorders characterized by damaged or degenerating nerves. NfL is a subunit of neurofilaments, which are cylindrical proteins exclusively located in the cytoplasm of nerve cells and are released into the CSF and blood when nerves are damaged (illustration below). Recent ultrasensitive techniques (e.g., single-molecule array technology) have made it possible to accurately and quantitatively detect longitudinal changes of NfL in both blood and CSF, with very low analytical variation. These assay properties, in addition to neuron-specificity, position NfL as an important decision-enabling tool in proof-of-concept studies of neuroprotective agents across a wide variety of diseases.
 Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) is released from damaged nerve cells
 

Elevated NfL levels correlate with current patient disability and predict patient outcomes in autoimmune neurological diseases such as GBS, multiple sclerosis, or MS, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and multifocal motor neuropathy as well as in chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, effective treatments for MS (e.g., ocrelizumab, natalizumab and fingolimod) and SMA (e.g., nusinersen) that prevent neurological disability in patients have been shown to significantly reduce NfL levels in these same patients. In patients with GBS, NfL is very highly elevated (in some instances, greater than 100-fold above normal). Retrospective and prospective studies in GBS patients have shown that NfL levels in CSF and serum may correlate with disease course, severity and prognosis in GBS.
 Preclinical Development in GBS
 As illustrated below, in a mouse model of severe GBS, ANX005 treatment blocked complement deposition on nerve terminals (left panel) and protected respiratory and motor function (right panel) when compared to an irrelevant immunoglobulin G, or IgG, isotype control antibody. A p-value is a measure of the statistical significance of the observed result. By convention, a p-value lower than 0.05 is considered statistically significant.

Phase 1a Trial in Healthy Volunteers
 ANX005 was initially evaluated in a Phase 1a dose-escalation single-dose trial designed to assess safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. This trial was conducted in 27 healthy volunteers in Australia. The dosing levels of ANX005 delivered in this trial ranged from 1 mg/kg to 8.2 mg/kg. We terminated the trial in healthy volunteers and transitioned our clinical development to evaluate ANX005 directly in patients with GBS based on guidance from the FDA in order to expediently advance this program in the United States.
 Phase 1b Trial in GBS Patients
 We have closely coordinated our clinical efforts with leading researchers of the International GBS Outcome Study, or IGOS, in pursuing a novel therapy for GBS. With the goal of aiding the development of effective treatments for GBS, practitioners established IGOS in May 2012, and have collected natural history data from over 1,750 newly-diagnosed GBS patients worldwide. IGOS is a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study that aims to identify the clinical and biological determinants and predictors of disease onset as well as the subtype, course and outcome of GBS. IGOS was established to help develop a better understanding of the mechanism of disease progression and recovery and to conduct selective therapeutic trials to improve patient outcomes. This natural history database is an invaluable resource to clinical development, facilitating the design of clinical trials, optimal selection of endpoints, and patient follow-up for one to three years. We initiated our GBS clinical development in Bangladesh, a country where the incidence of GBS is several times higher than in North America and Europe and where 17% of patients die from the disease and 20% suffer permanent disability and are unable to walk. Additionally, our site in Bangladesh is well situated to conduct clinical research in GBS in a manner compliant with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements. As of March 2017, Bangladesh had enrolled more patients in IGOS than any other country, representing approximately 15% of all enrolled patients worldwide.
 We conducted a Phase 1b placebo-controlled, dose escalation trial (n=31) of ANX005 in GBS patients at a tertiary care hospital in Bangladesh, in compliance with GCP as described above. The trial objectives included safety and tolerability, dosing levels and target engagement, and included a follow up of eight weeks. The dosing levels of ANX005 delivered in this trial ranged from 3 mg/kg to 75 mg/kg. ANX005 was well tolerated, and no drug-related serious adverse events or drug-related discontinuations occurred. The most common adverse events were acute infusion-related reactions, or IRRs, which occurred in the majority of patients and presented as low grade, non-serious, transient skin rash. These acute IRRs were mitigated by standard anti-inflammatory pre-medications.
 Results from the Phase 1b trial showed increasing serum levels of ANX005 and its duration in the circulation at increasing dose levels, and that the drug was present in the serum for up to three weeks at a dose of 75 mg/kg (left panel). When ANX005 was present in the circulation C1q function was fully inhibited, and rapidly returned to normal levels as ANX005 serum levels declined (right panel showing data from a patient receiving 75 mg/kg).

Much of the proximal weakness in GBS patients is due to involvement of peripheral nerve roots that are immersed in CSF as they exit the spinal cord. Hence, we believe product candidate levels and target inhibition in CSF may be an important contributor to efficacy. We observed that ANX005 entered the CSF of GBS patients treated with doses of 18-75 mg/kg of ANX005, resulting in full engagement of C1q inhibition in the CSF (as shown below).
 Inhibition of C1q Observed in CSF at 18-75 mg/kg
 

In the Phase 1b trial in GBS patients, ANX005 treatment at doses that engaged C1q in both serum and CSF (i.e., 18-75 mg/kg dose) resulted in a statistically significant early decline in serum NfL levels compared to placebo (2-4 week post treatment p-value <0.05, left panel below). In this Phase 1b trial, we also explored the administration of ANX005 on multiple validated clinical disability measures including GBS-Disability Score, or GBS-DS, Medical Research Council Muscle Strength Scale, or MRC, and Inflammatory Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale, or I-RODS, over an eight-week period. We observed that early decline in NfL correlated with improvement in the GBS-DS at the end of the study (2-8 week post treatment p-value <0.05; right panel below). We believe these results suggest that ANX005 had a rapid impact on the disease process by ameliorating antibody-induced nerve damage, likely within the first two weeks of dosing.

Though the trial was not powered for statistical significance, treatment with ANX005 resulted in consistent, positive numerical trends, including an improvement in MRC score and the number of days of ventilation. We observed a dose-dependent trend for improvement in MRC within the first week of treatment (as shown below).
 
Mean Change in MRC Score 
 Week 1 from Baseline
 
Dose ANX005 (mg/kg)
 
Early improvement in MRC is known to have strong prognostic implications on long-term functional recovery (modified Erasmus GBS Outcome Score). In line with this published data, we found that early improvement in MRC correlated with patients’ disability scores at the end of the Phase 1b trial (GBS-DS at week eight). This result is important because GBS-DS is typically used as the primary endpoint in GBS registrational studies. In addition, using a responder analysis, 28% of patients treated with high dose ANX005 (18-75 mg/kg) improved by at least three points on GBS-DS by week 8 compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients (as shown below). Patients treated with ANX005 showed a trend of improvement on GBS-DS when using a mean analysis. Both results are promising but not statistically significant.
 
Based on the results of the Phase 1b trial, we selected the 75 mg/kg dose of ANX005 for ongoing development in GBS. Following the completion of the Phase 1b treatment cohorts (through 75 mg/kg), two unblinded exploratory cohorts were enrolled to establish higher dose and multiple dose safety and PK/PD to inform subsequent chronic dosing trials. These two exploratory cohorts were a single dose of 100 mg/kg, and two doses of 75 mg/kg separated by one week (150 mg/kg total). At these higher dose levels, ANX005 was well-tolerated, and no drug-related serious adverse events or drug-related discontinuations occurred; moreover, we did not reach a maximum tolerated dose. Similarly, we observed full inhibition of C1q in serum and CSF, a reduction in NfL and trends of improvement in clinical measures when compared to placebo; however, there was no additional impact on these clinical measures beyond that seen at 75 mg/kg.
 
The results of the Phase 1b dose ranging trial in GBS showed that ANX005 was well-tolerated, fully inhibited C1q in the blood and CSF at target doses, and demonstrated an early reduction in NfL levels. Drug treatment was associated with a trend for early improvement in MRC, and early changes in MRC significantly correlated with improved clinical measures in GBS patients. An additional key learning from the study is the 
 19


importance of using baseline MRC for patient stratification at the time of hospitalization and study entry. Accounting for baseline MRC strengthened the impact of ANX005 treatment in the biomarker and clinical measures, demonstrating that MRC will be an important stratification tool in future GBS trials.
 Ongoing Development of ANX005 for GBS
 We completed a DDI trial which demonstrated that concomitant use of ANX005 and IVIg in GBS patients was well-tolerated and achieved full target engagement. A randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of ANX005 in improving disability in GBS patients is ongoing, and we anticipate reporting data from this trial in 2023.
 ANX005 for the Treatment of Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemias
 Overview of Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemias
 Autoimmune hemolytic anemias, or AIHA, are characterized by the presence of auto-antibodies that bind red blood cells and activate the classical complement pathway. The temperature at which these auto-antibodies bind to red blood cells determines whether the hemolytic anemia is labelled “cold” or “warm.” In both cases, the antibodies trigger classical complement activation, which tags red blood cells with complement components (e.g., C3d, C4d) for removal in the spleen or liver (via extra-vascular hemolysis) or, less commonly, leads to their direct lysis within blood vessels by the C5b-9 membrane attack complex (intravascular hemolysis). The “cold” forms of AIHA are known to be complement-mediated disorders, whereas complement is hypothesized to play a dominant role in a subset of patients with the “warm” form of AIHA. It is estimated that less than 5,000 people have the cold form while approximately 30,000 people have the warm form of AIHA in the United States. There are no approved treatments for AIHA in the United States; however, blood transfusions, steroids, rituximab, chemotherapies and splenectomies are currently used to treat patients with AIHA. It is estimated that up to 30% of patients require second-line treatment when treated with the standard of care treatment and approximately 11% of cases after symptom onset result in death.
 Ongoing Development of ANX005 in Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemias
 We have found that ANX005 inhibited complement deposition on human red blood cells (left panel) and prevented direct red blood cell lysis (right panel) induced by sera from CAD patients as ex vivo models of extravascular and intravascular lysis, respectively.
We have observed in both preclinical studies and in our Phase 1b trial in patients with GBS that treatment with ANX005 resulted in near complete inhibition of C1q, as measured in serum by the same ex vivo hemolysis assay used for hemolytic anemia conditions. Thus, we believe that ANX005 may be able to achieve near complete suppression of complement-mediated hemolysis in patients with wAIHA.
We are conducting a non-interventional screening study in wAIHA patients to utilize complement activation markers in an effort to identify and select patients who may be more likely to respond to our anti-C1q therapy in our Phase 2 trial. The open label Phase 2 trial in wAIHA patients is designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamic impact and efficacy, as measured by biomarkers of hemolysis and changes in hemoglobin. We anticipate reporting data from this trial in the second half of 2022. We are also evaluating ANX005 in patients with CAD.

ANX005 for the Treatment of Huntington’s Disease
 Overview of Huntington’s Disease
 HD is an orphan hereditary neurodegenerative disease that is fatal and for which there are no approved treatments that can reverse or slow its course of progression. HD symptoms typically begin to manifest between the ages of 30 to 50 and progress as a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormal involuntary movements, known as chorea, spreading to all muscles, progressive dementia and psychiatric manifestations such as depression and psychosis. Ultimately, affected individuals succumb to cardio-respiratory complications. Life expectancy after symptom onset is approximately 10 to 20 years. Some of the symptoms of HD such as chorea and depression can be managed with medications.
 Approximately 25,000 to 35,000 people in the United States have HD. Estimates project that approximately 75,000 people in the United States and other major market countries will have HD by 2025. Because HD is a genetic disease in which an individual with a single copy of the dysfunctional gene will develop the disease, every child of a parent with HD has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the faulty gene and developing the disease. There are an estimated 200,000 individuals in the United States who have a 50 percent risk of developing HD because of their family relationship to HD patients. It is estimated that only five to seven percent of these at-risk individuals have voluntarily undergone genetic testing due to the devastating nature of the disease and the lack of any effective treatments. The development of a disease-modifying therapy could encourage at-risk patients to seek out testing and thereby both provide hope to gene carriers and expand the number of patients who may benefit from treatment.
 C1q is a key driver of pathogenesis in HD
 HD is caused by a genetic mutation, specifically, by expansion of the number of cytosine-adenine-guanine, or CAG, nucleotide sequences within the DNA of the huntingtin gene, which leads to production of a mutant huntingtin protein that is thought to be neurotoxic and promote the degeneration of neurons. Above a threshold of 35 CAG repeats, the age of disease onset is inversely correlated with the number of CAG repeats. The classical complement cascade is activated in HD patients and is associated with progressive synapse loss. We hypothesize that C1q plays an important role in the degenerative process by tagging weakened synapses and triggering a neuroinflammatory response that leads to aberrant synapse loss and progressive neuronal destruction. As shown below, we observed that increased complement activation in HD patients (as measured by the complement activation marker C4a in CSF) was associated with disease progression.
 

21



NfL is elevated in HD patients
 Both CSF (shown below) and plasma levels were found to be elevated in HD patients compared to healthy controls, consistent with observations in other neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, plasma NfL is increased with advancing disease severity and increases at an earlier age with a greater number of the CAG repeats. NfL levels in both plasma and CSF correlate better than levels of the mutant huntingtin, or mHTT, protein itself, with clinical functional/cognitive measures such as total Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale and with brain volume measures as determined by MRI. In addition, while CSF mHTT levels accurately differentiate controls and HD mutation carriers, only NfL in CSF and plasma is able to distinguish presymptomatic from symptomatic (manifest) HD patients, suggesting that NfL might be one of the earliest detectable abnormalities in the progression to manifest HD. Of note, NfL levels were shown to reflect future patient outcomes as well as current disability.
 Increased Nfl in the CSF with Disease Progression
 

Progressive synapse loss in HD patients
 As shown below, researchers observed in post-mortem tissue from HD patients that the number of synapses on neurons connecting specific regions of the brain (the cortex and striatum) were reduced compared to healthy controls, with patients more advanced in the disease process (Huntington’s disease stage 4) showing greater loss of synapses than earlier stage patients (Huntington’s disease stage 2). These results are consistent with our hypothesis that complement activation leads to synapse elimination and neuronal damage.
 Progressive Synapse Loss in Huntington’s Disease Synapse number (% Control)
 

ANX005 protected against synapse loss and reduced NfL in a preclinical model of HD
 In transgenic mouse models of HD, we assessed the potential of peripherally administered ANX005 to inhibit activation of the classical complement cascade and protect against synapse loss. As shown below, ANX005 treatment reduced the amount of activated complement factor C3d that was deposited on synapses in the striatum
22


(the same region of the brain as affected in HD patients; left panel), reduced CSF levels of NfL (middle panel), and reduced the loss of synapses (right panel). We believe these three lines of evidence support the hypothesis that ANX005 blocks complement-mediated neurodegeneration in HD and can lead to preservation of neuronal synapses.
 

Development of ANX005 in HD
 We are currently conducting an open-label Phase 2 trial in HD patients to evaluate ANX005’s ability to inhibit C1q in the CSF and to reduce levels of serum and CSF NfL. In January 2022, we reported interim results from patients who completed the 24-week treatment period. This interim analysis showed that treatment with ANX005 was generally well-tolerated as of the safety cutoff date of October 17, 2021, with full target engagement of C1q in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) observed through the dosing period as of December 14, 2021. Evaluable patients maintained clinical function, as measured by changes in mean Composite Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (cUHDRS), relative to baseline after six months of treatment, and improvement in cUHDRS was observed in more than half of all evaluable patients and in 75% of evaluable patients who showed excess complement activity at baseline. NfL levels observed after six months of treatment remained generally consistent and were comparable to NfL levels described in published natural history data for HD patients. Overall, these interim findings appeared to support the scientific hypothesis of our scientific founder, the late Ben Barres, who believed that blocking C1q protects synaptic loss and can lead to rapid functional impact on clinical outcomes in neurodegenerative diseases. 
 The Phase 2 trial remains ongoing, and we anticipate reporting full data from all patients treated, including data from the three-month follow-up period, in the second quarter of 2022. Pending results from the full dataset, we plan to evaluate the opportunity for a Phase 3 trial of ANX005 in HD patients.
 ANX005 for the Treatment of ALS
 Overview of ALS
 ALS is a devastating neurodegenerative disease with no curative treatment that affects about 30,000 patients worldwide. There are rare familial forms of ALS (e.g., due to DNA mutations in the SOD1 and C9ORF72 genes), but the majority of ALS cases are considered sporadic. The disease is a motor neuron disease impacting both the central and peripheral nervous systems. ALS causes progressive weakness of limb, respiratory, swallowing and speaking muscles, and death typically occurs within two to five years after symptom onset. There is evidence that neurodegeneration begins peripherally, at the neuromuscular junction, or NMJ, and then proceeds proximally to involve the peripheral motor nerves, ventral nerve roots, spinal cord and brain motor cortex (“dying back” neurodegeneration). The NMJ is a specialized synapse between peripheral motor nerve and muscle fiber. As 
 23


illustrated below, “dying back” of the peripheral nerve in ALS is associated with C1q / classical complement deposition on the NMJ.
 

C1q involvement in ALS
 C1q and classical pathway activation is elevated in ALS patients. Specifically, C1q deposition has been noted in NMJs and C4d levels are increased in the CSF of ALS patients.
 As shown below in a preclinical model of ALS, muscle levels of C1q (at NMJs) increased with age (left panel) and were observed to correlate with decline in muscle strength (right panel).
 

Our goal with our C1q inhibitor is to prevent loss of NMJs and hence prevent “dying back” neurodegeneration of motor nerves in patients with ALS. Of note, there is significant overlap in the peripheral nerve structures that are involved in both GBS and ALS; therefore, we believe our ANX005 pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data in GBS patients can be extrapolated to ALS patients.
 24


Likewise, in an experimental model of SMA, another peripheral nerve degenerative disease that is pathologically similar to ALS, we found that treatment with anti-C1q antibody (mouse precursor of ANX005) protected against synapse loss and improved motor function. The same peripheral nerve pathway is involved in GBS and ALS, as illustrated below.
 The same peripheral nerve pathway is involved in GBS and ALS
 


NfL is elevated in ALS patients
 ALS patients have substantial elevations of NfL in both CSF and serum compared with controls and pre-symptomatic mutation carriers. In ALS patients, serum levels of NfL increase in the year prior to onset of disease symptoms (see below). In addition, it has been observed that NfL levels in ALS patients correlate both with current disability and future patient outcomes.
 Serum NfL Elevated in ALS Patients a Year Prior to Symptom Onset
 

Development of ANX005 in ALS
 We are currently conducting an open-label Phase 2 trial in ALS patients to evaluate ANX005’s ability to inhibit C1q in the CSF and to reduce NfL levels in serum in ALS patients. We anticipate reporting data from this trial in 2023. Based on the results of this trial, we will evaluate whether to initiate a potential registrational program for ALS.
 If either of the HD or ALS Phase 2 trials are successful, we will consider proof-of-concept studies in other CNS neurodegenerative indications, such as Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia and progressive multiple sclerosis.
 25


Our Second Product Candidate, ANX007
 ANX007 is an investigational monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment, or Fab, that is designed to potently bind to C1q and inhibit activation of the classical complement cascade. We activated an IND for ANX007 in 2018 and are developing ANX007 as an intravitreal injection for ophthalmic indications such as glaucoma and geographic atrophy. We have conducted a Phase 1b trial of ANX007 in patients with glaucoma, and based on these and preclinical study results, we believe ANX007 may have potential to treat patients with GA.
 ANX007 for the Treatment of Ophthalmic Diseases, including Glaucoma and Geographic Atrophy
 Overview of Glaucoma
 Glaucoma is a major cause of blindness and results from progressive loss of neurons in the retina called Retinal Ganglion Cells, and optic nerve degeneration. A frequent risk factor for glaucoma is elevated intraocular pressure, or IOP, but there are patients with “normotensive” glaucoma who have normal IOP. Patients with glaucoma have progressive loss of peripheral vision, which can eventually result in functional blindness.
 It is estimated that over three million people in the United States have glaucoma but only half of these people have been diagnosed. More than 120,000 people in the United States are blind due to glaucoma, accounting for 9 to 12% of all cases of blindness. The worldwide prevalence of glaucoma has been estimated to be over 60 million people. Glaucoma is a disease that is more frequently found in older adults with rates increasing several fold between ages 50 and 70. Similar to other neurodegenerative diseases, the overall prevalence of glaucoma is projected to increase as populations age worldwide.
 Glaucoma is one of the largest segments of the global ophthalmic market and has a significant impact on the quality of life. Patients’ ability to perform daily activities becomes increasingly limited as the disease progresses. Individuals with glaucoma are more likely to experience falls, to be involved in motor vehicle collisions, to suffer depression and to require admission to a nursing home.
 The goal of existing therapies for glaucoma is reduction of IOP. IOP-lowering treatments are typically administered in the form of eye drops, and patients may require surgery to facilitate drainage of fluid in the eye. However, approximately ten percent of people who receive appropriate treatment nevertheless continue to experience progressive vision loss. The optic nerve damage observed in glaucoma is believed to be irreversible, highlighting the need for neuroprotective therapies that can slow or stop the damage to optic nerves.
 Role of C1q in Glaucoma
 C1q, the initiating molecule of the classical complement cascade, has been implicated in the progression of neurodegenerative disease, including glaucoma. The lab of our scientific founder, Dr. Ben Barres, reported that C1q accumulated on retinal neurons and their synapses early in the disease process in a chronic mouse model of glaucoma, before the onset of other observable changes. C1q accumulation continued as synapses were lost, followed by loss of the optic nerve. Subsequent studies showed that genetic deletion of C1q protected against optic nerve damage in a chronic mouse model of glaucoma at 12 months of age (left panel, figure below).
 26


Using pharmacological inhibition of C1q with ANX007, we observed these findings in a different mouse model of glaucoma involving acute elevation of IOP. In this model, animals received an intravitreal injection of the M1-Fab murine precursor of ANX007 at the time of IOP elevation, followed by a second dose one week later, and their retinas were examined at week 2. As shown in the right panel of the figure below, intravitreal administration of ANX007 protected against optic nerve damage.
 

Independent investigators observed elevated levels of C1q and other components of the classical complement cascade in the inner retinal synapse layer of 34 out of 34 human donor eyes from patients with glaucoma, as illustrated below. C1q was not found in donor eyes from individuals who did not have glaucoma.
 

Overview of Geographic Atrophy
 GA is an advanced, vision-threatening form of age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, and is a chronic, progressive disease of the macula that results in loss of central vision. The disease typically affects one eye first, with a high likelihood of it occurring in the second eye over time.
 There are two forms of AMD, “dry” AMD and “wet” AMD. Dry AMD is the most common form, representing approximately 85% to 90% of all AMD cases. Geographic atrophy represents the advanced form of dry AMD and is characterized by progressive atrophy of retinal pigment epithelial cells, overlying photoreceptors and underlying choriocapillaries. An early feature of the disease is the presence of drusen, which is comprised of extracellular yellow deposits at the back of the retina.
 27


GA accounts for about ten percent of legal blindness related to AMD. Approximately one million individuals in the United States and five million individuals worldwide suffer from geographic atrophy. As with AMD, the prevalence of geographic atrophy increases with age. There are no approved therapies to prevent either the onset or progression of geographic atrophy.
Role of C1q and Complement in Geographic Atrophy
 Genome-wide association studies have strongly implicated multiple components of the complement cascade in AMD and geographic atrophy. For example, specific alleles of the gene for C3 can increase the likelihood of developing AMD by 50 percent. Histopathological investigations have also observed the presence of complement components in geographic atrophy. These studies largely point to a role of excessive C3 activity in disease, but do not indicate how C3 is being activated (classical, lectin or alternative pathways). We have identified a potential dual role of C1q and the classical cascade as an important complement-activating system in geographic atrophy. First, we found that C1q strongly accumulated on photoreceptor cell synapses with normal age or disease, as shown below (left panels), implicating C1q’s role in excessive synapse pruning and complement-mediated neurodegeneration. Second, C1q and C1q ligands, such as C-reactive protein, also accumulated in the retina below photoreceptor cells in association with drusen (extracellular membrane and protein debris associated with geographic atrophy; right panel). These results suggest that the photoreceptor neurons and pigmented retinal epithelial cells – cell types that are both lost in GA – are sandwiched between deposits of C1q and that the classical complement cascade may have an ongoing and pathogenic role in GA by activating C3.
 

In support of this hypothesis, we found that either deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of C1q was protective in an animal model of photoreceptor neuron loss induced by photo-oxidation, as shown below. Further, components of the classical complement cascade have been associated with photoreceptor cells in human GA tissue (C4 and C3) and implicated in photoreceptor cell targeting with an in vitro assay. Finally, C1q is locally produced within the retina during disease by infiltrating immune cells, indicating that its pathogenic role may be amenable to local inhibition of C1q. As described above, we believe inhibition of C1q would block all key components of the classical cascade, including C1q, C4, and C3 involved in immune cell attack and synapse pruning, as well as C5 involved in direct membrane damage.
 As shown below, C1q inhibition was protective of photoreceptor cells and retinal function in a model of GA.
 28




Development of ANX007 for Ophthalmic Diseases
 We have completed a Phase 1b trial of ANX007 in patients with glaucoma. Based on our Phase 1b clinical results in glaucoma, our preclinical data showing protection in three retinal neurodegeneration animal models (glaucoma, optic neuritis and GA), and our knowledge of C1q biology in this setting, we initiated a Phase 2 trial of ANX007 in GA. Our rationale to pursue ANX007 for GA includes:
  
• | The classical complement pathway is implicated in GA by human genetics, and C1q and C4 are associated with pathology in human GA tissue. C1q is produced locally in the eye by infiltrating immune cells and may be more amenable to local inhibition by intravitreal administration of ANX007.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The potential role of C1q in GA may be dual-purpose, resulting in both complement-mediated neurodegeneration and localized tissue damage unique to the eye. Local administration of ANX007 has been shown to be protective in animal photoreceptor neuron loss and achieved complete C1q inhibition in patients for 1-2 months.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There is a well-established clinical and regulatory path for development.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 1b Trial in Glaucoma
 We completed single ascending dose (n=9) and sham-controlled multiple dose (n=17) studies of intravitreal ANX007 in patients with glaucoma to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and target engagement. These patients had aqueous humor taps so that ocular fluid could be analyzed for levels of ANX007 and free C1q immediately prior to first dose (day 1) and prior to second dose (day 29). The studies showed that ANX007 was well-tolerated at all doses (1 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg) and achieved complete suppression of C1q at 2.5 mg and 5 mg, as illustrated below. We believe these results suggest that ANX007 can be dosed monthly or potentially less 
 29


frequently in future Phase 2 efficacy trials. We are exploring further development of ANX007 that could enable patients to be dosed as infrequently as every six months.
 

Ongoing Phase 2 Trial in Geographic Atrophy
 A randomized, controlled Phase 2 trial in GA patients who are at a high risk of progression is ongoing, and we anticipate reporting data from this trial in 2023. Prior natural history data similar to that found in other recent large Phase 3 trials may provide a wealth of natural history data from nearly 2,000 patients on how to successfully enrich fast progressors of GA to enable an efficacy read-out within a one-year time period. The Phase 2 trial is designed to evaluate clinical effect on slowing of GA lesion growth, leveraging the natural history data and patient selection criteria of prior GA trials.
Our Third Product Candidate, ANX009
 ANX009 is designed to potently bind to C1q and inhibit activation of the classical complement cascade. ANX009 is a Fab designed for subcutaneous delivery, and was well tolerated in preclinical toxicology studies. A Phase 1 FIH clinical trial was completed in 2021 and data showed that ANX009 was well tolerated and showed complete and sustained C1q inhibition, supporting potential twice weekly subcutaneous administration.
ANX009 for Future Autoimmune Indications
 We are developing ANX009 to potentially enable chronic dosing in antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases such as hemolytic anemias, wAIHA and CAD. In addition, we are evaluating ANX009 as a treatment option for a subset of lupus nephritis patients who are at a high risk of renal flare due to pathogenic anti-C1q antibodies in the circulation, and who we believe may respond to treatment with our anti-C1q approach. For this purpose, we
30


have identified a plasma biomarker that identifies lupus nephritis patients with ongoing early classical complement cascade activation.
 

We have observed that daily subcutaneous administration of ANX009 fully inhibited C1q functional activity in the serum of non-human primates. Its activity occurred rapidly after the first dose and this activity rapidly reversed after dosing was stopped.
 

We believe that ANX009’s inhibitory activity and its on/off function may benefit patients with hematological autoimmune disorders. Importantly, the use of plasma biomarkers that define an active complement signature will allow us to take a precision medicine approach to identify patients appropriate for anti-C1q therapy.
 Our Next-Generation Product Candidates
 We are developing next-generation product candidates, including ANX105, an investigational monoclonal antibody designed to have enhanced dosing and PK properties facilitating use in chronic neurodegenerative diseases. We plan to initiate a FIH trial of ANX105 in the first half of 2022 with data expected in 2023. Our small molecule program is targeting compounds suitable for oral dosing for the treatment of chronic autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. We are developing ANX1502, an investigational oral small molecule for the treatment of autoimmune indications, and plan to initiate a FIH clinical trial in the second half of 2022 with data anticipated in 2023.

 Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, new therapeutic approaches and potential indications, and other inventions that are important to our business. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important for the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how that is not patentable, we rely on confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. We generally require our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information and requiring disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
 Our patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications that are licensed to us in whole or in part from a number of partners, including Stanford University and the University of California, and patents and patent applications that are owned by us. Our proprietary technology has been primarily developed by in-house research and development programs, and to a lesser extent through acquisitions, relationships with academic research centers and contract research organizations.
 For our product candidates, we will, in general, initially pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter and methods of use. Throughout the development of our product candidates, we seek to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including by protecting inventions related to additional methods of use, processes of making, formulation and dosing regimens.
 We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights, including through exclusive licenses, to all of our product candidates, which allows us to strategically maximize value from our product portfolio over time. Our patent portfolio includes patent protection for our upstream complement platform and each of our product candidates. 
 As of January 15, 2022, our patent portfolio, including patents licensed from our partners, comprised 15 different patent families filed in various jurisdictions worldwide. Our patent portfolio includes issued patents and patent applications in the United States and in other jurisdictions.
 One patent family, which we exclusively license from Stanford University, includes nine granted U.S. patents covering various methods of treating neurodegeneration and related medical conditions by inhibiting the C1 complex or its components, such as by using an anti-C1q antibody. The U.S. patents in this family include claims covering uses of ANX005, ANX007, ANX009 and ANX105. These U.S. patents will expire between 2026 and 2030, absent any disclaimers, extensions or adjustments of patent term. There are no pending applications or foreign patents in this family.
 Two other patent families, which we own, are directed to anti-C1q antibodies and methods of using them. These families include five granted U.S. patents, two pending U.S. patent applications, 15 granted foreign patents and 24 pending foreign patent applications. The U.S. patents in these families cover ANX005, ANX007, ANX009 and ANX105. These patents will expire between 2034 and 2037, absent any disclaimers, extensions or adjustments of patent term. 
 Another patent family that we own includes one granted U.S. patent, one pending U.S. patent application, one granted foreign patent, and 13 pending foreign patent applications. The granted U.S. patent in this family includes claims directed to antibody fragments of anti-C1q antibodies, including ANX007 and ANX009. This patent will expire in 2037, absent any disclaimers, extensions or adjustments of patent term.
 Two other patent families that we own include two U.S. patent applications.  The U.S. patent applications in these families include claims directed to anti-C1q antibodies, including ANX105. Patents that may be issued from this family would expire in 2042, absent any disclaimers, extensions or adjustments of patent term. 
 32


Another patent family that we own includes one pending U.S. patent application, one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, application, and three pending foreign patent applications.  The pending U.S. patent application in this family includes claims covering certain small molecule modulators of the classical pathway, including ANX1502. Patents that may be issued from this family would expire in 2041, absent any disclaimers, extensions or adjustments of patent term.
 Our patent portfolio also includes eight patent families, owned by us solely or jointly with the University of California or The J. David Gladstone Institutes or Fondazione Telthon and Universitia degla Studi di Trento, directed to the treatment of certain medical conditions using anti-C1q antibodies, including ANX005, ANX007, ANX009 and ANX105. These families include four pending U.S. patent applications, one granted foreign patent, five pending foreign patent applications, and four pending PCT applications. Patents that may be issued from these applications would expire between 2034 and 2042, absent any disclaimers, extensions or adjustments of patent term.
 Exclusive (Equity) Agreement with The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University
 In November 2011, we and The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, or Stanford, entered into an exclusive licensing agreement, or the Stanford Agreement. Under the Stanford Agreement, Stanford granted to us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license, under certain patent rights, or the Licensed Patents, to make, use, offer for sale, sell, import and otherwise commercialize products covered by the Licensed Patents for human or animal diseases, disorders or conditions. We are required to meet certain development and funding diligence milestones for the licensed products.
 Under the Stanford Agreement, we are obligated to pay Stanford an upfront payment, license maintenance fees ranging from the single digit to tens of thousands of dollars per year, and milestone payments totaling up to $675,000. We also agreed to make royalty payments at a rate equal to a low single-digit percentage of worldwide net sales of licensed products and a portion of certain sublicensing income we receive from sublicensees at a rate in the low double digit percentages, subject to a specified maximum total payment. 
 Additionally, in accordance with the terms of the Stanford Agreement, upon closing our first financing event that raised at least $2.0 million, we granted Stanford $150,000 in shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock. We may also have to pay a fee to Stanford if we assign our rights under the Stanford Agreement to a third party.
 We may terminate the Stanford Agreement in its entirety, or as to a particular Licensed Patent or licensed product, for convenience on thirty days’ prior written notice. Stanford may terminate the Stanford Agreement for our breach that remains uncured for forty-five days or if we provide any false report, are delinquent on any report or payment, fail to achieve a milestone or fail to diligently develop and commercialize a licensed product.
 Patent Term and Term Extensions
 The terms of individual patents are determined based primarily on the filing date of the earliest non-provisional patent application to which a claim of priority is made or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued for applications filed in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the filing date of the earliest non-provisional patent application to which a claim of priority is made. In addition, in certain instances, the term of a U.S. patent can be extended to recapture a portion of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the restoration period cannot extend the patent term beyond 14 years from FDA approval for the product covered by that patent. In addition, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may receive the extension, and the extension applies only to coverage for the approved drug, methods for using it and methods of manufacturing it, even if the claims cover other products or product candidates. Where one patent covers multiple products or product candidates, it may only receive an extension for one of the covered products; any extension related to a second product or product candidate must be applied to a different patent. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from filing date of the earliest non-provisional patent application to which a claim of priority is made, such as a PCT application. All taxes, annuities or maintenance fees for a patent, as required by the USPTO and various foreign jurisdictions, must be timely paid in order for the patent to remain in force during this period of time.
 33


The actual protection afforded by a patent may vary on a product by product basis, from country to country, and can depend upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions and the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 Our patents and patent applications may be subject to procedural or legal challenges by others. We may be unable to obtain, maintain and protect the intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business, and we may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, which could materially harm our business. For more information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 Trademarks and Know-How
 In connection with the ongoing development and advancement of our products and services in the United States and various international jurisdictions, we seek to create protection for our marks and enhance their value by pursuing trademarks and service marks where available and when appropriate. In addition to patent and trademark protection, we rely upon know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed by our employees and through relationships with third parties. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors, commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For more information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 Sales and Marketing
 We hold worldwide commercialization rights, including through exclusive licenses, to our product candidates. Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. Should any of our product candidates be approved for commercialization, we intend to develop a plan to commercialize them in the United States and other key markets, through internal infrastructure and/or external partnerships in a manner that will enable us to realize the full commercial value of our programs.
Manufacturing
 Our success as a company will depend on our ability to deliver reliable, high-quality preclinical and clinical drug supply. We do not currently own or operate facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing. We contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates. Because we rely on contract manufacturers, we employ personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience. Our staff has strong project management discipline to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions.
 Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulation that imposes various procedural and documentation requirements and that governs record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, and more. Our systems and our contractors are required to be in compliance with these regulations, and compliance is assessed regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program.
 Our current supply chains for our lead drug candidates involve several manufacturers that specialize in specific operations of the manufacturing process, specifically, raw materials manufacturing, drug substance manufacturing and drug product manufacturing. We currently operate under work order programs for our drug candidates with master services agreements in place that include specific supply timelines, volume and quality specifications. We intend to establish long-term supply agreements in the future. We believe our current manufacturers have the scale, the system, and the experience to supply our currently planned clinical trials.
 34


We do not currently require commercial manufacturing capabilities. Should our needs change, we will need to scale up our manufacturing processes to enable commercial launch. To ensure continuity in our supply chain, we plan to establish supply arrangements with alternative larger scale suppliers for certain portions of our supply chain, as appropriate.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, the expertise of our executive and scientific team, research, clinical capabilities, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, and experience in obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 Guillain-Barré Syndrome
 There are currently no approved therapies for GBS in the United States. IVIg and plasma exchange are the current standards of care in the Western world and parts of Asia and two products are in development. Hansa Biopharma AB is conducting an open label Phase 2 trial of imlifidase in GBS patients in Europe and AstraZeneca/Alexion is conducting a Phase 3 study of SOLIRIS in GBS in Japan. 
 Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemias
 There are currently no approved therapies for wAIHA in the United States and three products are in development in Phase 3 trials. Rigel is running a Phase 3 clinical trial of Tavalisse in wAIHA. Incyte initiated a Phase 3 wAIHA trial with parsaclisib, an oral PI3K delta inhibitor in January 2022. In addition, Janssen is conducting a Phase 2/3 trial of nipocalimab, an anti-neonatal Fc receptor antibody for wAIHA. 
 Sanofi’s sutimlimab is approved by the FDA for CAD. Other companies that have trials ongoing or planned in these rare anemias include Sanofi’s rilzabrutinib for wAIHA, Immunovant’s IMVT-1401 for wAIHA, Novartis’s iptacopan for CAD in Phase 2 and Sanofi’s BIVV020 for CAD in Phase 1. 
 Lupus Nephritis
 There are currently two approved medicines specifically for LN: GSK’s Benlysta and Aurinia’s Lupkynis. There are three products in development targeting the complement pathway, all in Phase 2 development: AstraZeneca’s ravulizumab, a C5 inhibitor, and ALXN2050, an oral Factor D inhibitor, as well as Omeros’s narsoplimab, a MASP-2-targeting monoclonal antibody. Outside of the complement pathway, there are four products in Phase 3 development: Roche’s Obinutuzumab, Novartis’s secukinumab and ianalumab and AstraZeneca’s anifrolumab.
 Huntington’s Disease
 There are no approved disease-modifying therapies for HD. Multiple companies are developing potentially disease-modifying therapies, including Prilenia’s Pridopidine in Phase 3, PTC Therapeutics’s PTC518 in Phase 2, and uniQure’s AMT-130 in Phase 1. Additional early-stage products in development are Wave Life Sciences’s WVE-003 in Phase and Novartis’s branaplam in Phase 2. 
 35


Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
 The drugs riluzole and Radicava (edaravone) are currently approved for the treatment of ALS and have shown modest effects in slowing the progression of the disease. Amylyx has completed a Phase 3 trial and submitted AMX0035 for approval to the FDA. Zilucoplan, a C5a inhibitor from UCB, is in a Phase 2/3 study as a part of the HEALY ALS platform trial. Apellis has also initiated a Phase 2 study with APL-2, their C3-inhibitor. There are a significant number of companies conducting clinical trials in ALS patients, including Ionis, NurOwn, Biohaven, Prilenia, Cytokinetics and others.
Geographic Atrophy
 No FDA-approved treatment is currently available for GA. We are aware of a number of companies developing products for the treatment of GA. Those products in clinical development targeting the complement cascade include: Apellis’s APL-2, a C3 inhibitor, which has completed a Phase 3 trial; Iveric Bio’s zimura, a C5 inhibitor in a Phase 3 trial; NGM Pharma’s NGM621, a C3 inhibitor in a Phase 2 trial; Ionis’s IONIS-FB-LR, an antisense molecule inhibitor of Complement Factor B in a Phase 2 trial; AstraZeneca’s danicopan, an oral, complement factor D inhibitor in a Phase 2 trial and Gemini Therapeutics’s GEM103, a recombinant complement factor H in a Phase 2 trial. Complement-directed therapies in clinical development for genetically selected patient populations include GT005, a Factor I gene therapy in Phase 2 development by Gyroscope, and GEM103, a Factor H replacement therapy in a Phase 2 trial being developed by Gemini Therapeutics. Other products that do not target the complement cascade currently in Phase 2 or 3 clinical trials are being developed by Roche, Stealth BioTherapeutics, Allegro, Alkeus Pharmaceuticals and Regenerative Patch Technologies.
 Government Regulation
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of product candidates such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process and a new biologic must be approved by the FDA through the biologics license application, or BLA, process before it may be legally marketed in the U.S. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 U.S. Biologics Regulation
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice requirements, or GLP requirements and other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee, or EC, at each clinical site before the trial is commenced at such site;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug, or the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic for its intended purpose; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA after completion of all required clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 36


 
• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA whether to file the application for review;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed drug or biologic is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCP; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA or NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for specific indication(s) for use in the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, a sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA, which is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for the proposed clinical trial(s). The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically goes into effect 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 Furthermore, an independent IRB or EC for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the trial until completed. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a Data Safety Monitoring Board, which provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. Regulatory authorities, the IRB/ethics committee or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objective(s). There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
 For purposes of BLA or NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These trials are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 37


 
metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 trials may also be made a condition to approval of the BLA or NDA.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMPs. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 FDA Review and Approval Process
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA or NDA requesting approval to market the product candidate for one or more indications. The BLA or NDA must include all relevant data available from preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product candidate or from a number of alternative sources, including studies and trials initiated by investigators. The submission of a BLA or NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA, and the sponsor of an approved BLA or NDA is also subject to an annual program fee. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs or NDAs for products designated as Orphan Drugs, unless the application also seeks a non-orphan-designated indication.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA or NDA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA or NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA or NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once a BLA or NDA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the filing date. Priority review designation will direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of applications for products that, if approved, would represent significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP‑compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facilities in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meet standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may also convene a public Advisory Committee to provide additional expert
38


insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an Advisory Committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions regarding approval.
 Before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites and/or the sponsor’s offices to assure compliance with GCP.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA or NDA and conducts inspections of clinical trial sites and manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an Approval Letter or a Complete Response Letter. An Approval Letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the BLA or NDA is not ready for approval in its present form and ends the current review cycle, and will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA or NDA. The FDA may issue the Complete Response Letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response Letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA or NDA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA or NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. Additionally, the FDA may approve a BLA or NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post- marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-marketing studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of product candidates that meet certain criteria. Specifically, drugs and biologics s are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. For a Fast Track product candidate, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA or NDA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. A BLA or NDA for a Fast Track-designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA sets the target date for FDA action on the BLA or NDA at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the product candidate, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious disease or condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA accepts the application for filing. 
 A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive Breakthrough Therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in 
 39


combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
 In addition, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drugs and biologics intended to treat serious or life threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the drug or biologic has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the drug or biologic’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. The FDA may withdraw approval of a product or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the sponsor fails to conduct any required post-marketing studies in a timely manner, or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product.
 Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan Drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or NDA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process
 If a product candidate that has Orphan Drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA or NDA, to market the same biologic for the same disease or condition for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with Orphan Drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the Orphan Drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the Orphan Drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan Drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug designation are tax credits for certain research and development activities and a waiver of the BLA or NDA application user fee.
 A designated Orphan Drug may not receive Orphan Drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received Orphan designation. In addition, Orphan Drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if the second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with Orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.

Post-Approval Requirements
 Any drugs or biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug and biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, Warning Letters, or untitled enforcement letters;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | clinical holds on clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of so-called “off-label” uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, Warning Letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.

Biosimilars and Exclusivity
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 Drug Product Marketing Exclusivity 
 Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. For example, the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
 The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not 
 42


require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including false claims, civil monetary penalties, consumer protection and transparency laws regarding drug pricing and payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and other licensed healthcare professionals, as well as similar foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the United States. Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, additional reporting obligations, contractual damages, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and imprisonment.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations, and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, including clinical trial data, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area, or the EEA. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and also the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. No uniform policy exists for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among U.S. third-party payors. Therefore, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication, or place products at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels and higher cost-sharing obligation imposed on patients. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service. As a result, the coverage determination process will often require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization.
 43


In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that a product will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payor’s reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability to sell a product profitably.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and fraud and abuse changes. Additionally, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 70 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs; implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, absent additional Congressional action.
 Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and 
 44


transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third-party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
