Overview 
 Zymeworks is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of next-generation multifunctional biotherapeutics. Our suite of complementary therapeutic platforms and our fully integrated drug development engine provide the flexibility and compatibility to precisely engineer and develop highly differentiated product candidates. These capabilities have resulted in multiple product candidates with the potential to drive positive outcomes in large underserved and unaddressed patient populations. 
 Our lead product candidate, ZW25, is a novel bispecific (dual-targeting) antibody which targets two distinct domains of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). In our adaptive Phase 1 clinical trial, ZW25 has been well tolerated with promising single-agent anti-tumor activity in patients with heavily pretreated HER2-expressing cancers that have progressed after standard of care, including multiple HER2-targeted regimens. Its unique design may enable ZW25 to address patient populations with all levels of HER2 expression, including those with low to intermediate HER2-expressing tumors, who are otherwise limited to chemotherapy or hormone therapy. Our second product candidate, ZW49, capitalizes on the unique design of ZW25 and is a bispecific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) based on the same antibody framework as ZW25 but armed with our proprietary ZymeLink-cytotoxic (potent cancer cell-killing) payload. We designed ZW49 to be a best-in-class HER2-targeting ADC for several indications characterized by HER2 expression. A Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating ZW49 began in the first quarter of 2019. We are also advancing a deep pipeline of preclinical product candidates and discovery-stage programs in immuno-oncology (I-O) and other therapeutic areas. In addition to our robust pipeline, our Azymetric and EFECT therapeutic platforms have been further leveraged through multiple revenue-generating strategic partnerships with the following global pharmaceutical companies: Merck Sharp & Dohme Research GmbH (Merck), Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), Celgene Corporation and Celgene Alpine Investment Co. LLC (Celgene), GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property Development Limited (GSK), Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. (Daiichi Sankyo), Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen), LEO Pharma A/S (LEO), and BeiGene, Ltd. (BeiGene). 
 Our proprietary capabilities and technologies include several modular, complementary therapeutic platforms that can be used in combination with each other and with existing approaches. This ability to layer technologies without compromising manufacturability enables us to engineer next-generation biotherapeutics with synergistic activity, which we believe will result in positive patient outcomes. Our core platforms include: 
 

 | Azymetric, our bispecific platform, which enables therapeutic antibodies to bind multiple distinct locations on target(s), known as epitopes. This is achieved by tailoring multiple configurations of the antibodys Fab regions (locations on the antibody to which epitopes bind);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ZymeLink, our ADC platform which comprises multiple cytotoxic payloads and the linker technology used to couple these payloads to tumor-targeting antibodies or proteins. This platform can be used in conjunction with our other therapeutic platforms to increase safety and efficacy as compared to existing ADC technologies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | EFECT, which enables finely tuned modulation (both up and down) of immune cell recruitment and function.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our protein engineering expertise and proprietary structure-guided molecular modeling capabilities enable these therapeutic platforms. Together with our internal antibody discovery and generation technologies, we have established a fully integrated drug development engine and toolkit capable of rapidly delivering a steady pipeline of next-generation product candidates in oncology and other therapeutic areas.

 Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to leverage our next-generation therapeutic platforms and proprietary protein engineering capabilities to become a domain dominator in the discovery, development, and commercialization of best-in-class multifunctional biotherapeutics for the treatment of cancer and other diseases with high unmet medical need. 
 Our key strategies in 2019 to achieve this goal are to: 
 

 | initiate multiple Phase 2 studies for ZW25;
--+--------------------------------------------


 | expand the clinical development of ZW25 further into Asia and into Europe;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | obtain and report ZW25 data from combination studies (chemotherapy and/or targeted agents);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | obtain and report data from the Phase 1 clinical trial for ZW49; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


 | establish additional drug development collaborations with a focus on new platforms.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Proprietary Therapeutic Platforms 
 Our expertise in protein engineering has enabled the development of our proprietary therapeutic platforms, a complementary suite of highly tailored biologics solutions. Our therapeutic platforms can be used alone or in combination to develop multifunctional fit-for-purpose biotherapeutics with bispecific capabilities (Azymetric), cytotoxic payload delivery (ZymeLink) and finely tuned immune function modulation (EFECT). The modular design and ease of use of our therapeutic platforms allow for the design and evaluation of multiple candidates with different formats to determine the optimal therapeutic combination early in development. We continue to leverage these therapeutic platforms to expand our pipeline of next-generation biotherapeutics that we believe could represent significant improvements to the standard of care in multiple cancer types. 
Azymetric Bispecific Antibody Platform 
 The Azymetric platform consists of a library of proprietary amino acid substitutions that enable the transformation of monospecific antibodies into bispecific antibodies, which gives them the ability to simultaneously bind two non-overlapping epitopes. Azymetric bispecific technology enables the development of biotherapeutics with dual-targeting of receptors/ligands and simultaneous blockade of multiple signaling pathways, increasing tumor-specific targeting and efficacy while reducing toxicities and the potential for drug resistance. In preclinical studies, the dual-targeting of Azymetric antibodies has demonstrated synergistic activity relative to the application of an equivalent dose of the corresponding monospecific antibodies. Azymetric bispecifics can also be engineered to enhance internalization of the antibody into the tumor cell and consequently increase the delivery of cytotoxic payloads. 
 
2 


 Azymetric bispecifics retain the desirable drug-like qualities of monoclonal antibodies, including long half-life, stability and low immunogenic potential, which increases their probability of success. Azymetric bispecifics are also compatible with standard manufacturing processes with high production yields and purity, which accelerates manufacturing timelines and reduces costs. 
 ZymeLink Conjugation Platform and Cytotoxins 
 The ZymeLink conjugation platform is a suite of novel site-specific protein coupling technologies and customizable cleavable linkers that can be combined with any of our product candidates to enable the delivery of our proprietary cytotoxic payloads to target cells. We believe that ZymeLink provides multiple competitive advantages over existing approaches, including optimized activity and tolerability profiles through increased drug delivery to target cells with reduced off-target effects, product homogeneity, preservation of immune-cell interaction and stable pharmacokinetics. 
 EFECT Antibody Effector Function Modulation Platform 
 The EFECT platform comprises sets of modifications to the crystallizable fragment (Fc) region of antibodies that enable the selective modulation of recruited cytotoxic immune cells for diverse therapeutic applications. This allows us to rationally tailor the selective enhancement or elimination of immune effector function to optimize product candidates. 
Product Candidate Pipeline and Advanced Preclinical and Discovery Programs 
 We currently have two lead product candidates in clinical development and several product candidates in preclinical development that leverage our multiple therapeutic platforms to address areas of significant unmet medical need. Our lead product candidates, ZW25 and ZW49, utilize our Azymetric bispecific platform to address patient populations with all levels of HER2 expression, including those with low to intermediate HER2-expressing tumors. We are also actively advancing a diverse set of preclinical and discovery programs, which leverage one or more of our proprietary therapeutic platforms to create multifunctional biotherapeutics. Our bispecific ADC programs utilize the Azymetric and ZymeLink platforms and have demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies with the potential for an enhanced therapeutic window. Our most advanced T cell-engaging bispecific program leverages the Azymetric platform combined with our proprietary protein engineering expertise resulting in potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies. We are also developing several checkpoint-modulating bispecifics for immuno-oncology and other therapeutic areas to create a deep pipeline of well-differentiated product candidates. 
 The table below summarizes our current product candidate pipeline.

ZW25: HER2-Targeted Bispecific Antibody 
 Overview 
 ZW25, our lead product candidate currently being evaluated in an adaptive Phase 1 clinical trial in the United States, Canada, and South Korea, is based on our Azymetric platform. It is a bispecific antibody that can simultaneously bind two non-overlapping epitopes, known as biparatopic binding, of HER2 resulting in dual HER2 signal blockade, increased binding and removal of HER2 protein from the cell surface, and potent effector function. These combined mechanisms of action have led to activity in preclinical models of breast cancer, including trastuzumab-resistant (currently branded as Herceptin) high HER2-expressing tumors, as well as in tumors with lower levels of HER2 expression. Approximately 81% of patients with HER2-expressing breast cancer and 57% of patients with HER2-expressing gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer have tumors that express low to intermediate levels of HER2, making them ineligible for treatment with currently approved HER2-targeted therapies, such as Herceptin and Perjeta. In addition, multiple other cancers, including ovarian, bladder, colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer express HER2 at varying levels. Therefore, there is a significant unmet need for HER2-targeted agents that can effectively treat these patients. 
 We are developing ZW25 as a best-in-class HER2-targeting antibody as a treatment option for patients with any solid tumor that expresses HER2. Our focus is on the treatment of patients with high HER2-expressing breast or gastric cancers that have progressed after treatment with HER2-targeted therapies, such as Herceptin and Perjeta, or that are not eligible for approved HER2-targeted therapies based on lower levels of HER2 expression. We are also evaluating ZW25 as a therapeutic agent for other HER2-expressing cancers for which HER2-targeted therapies are not currently approved. ZW25 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of both gastric and ovarian cancer by the FDA. 
 In our Phase 1 clinical trial, ZW25 has been well tolerated with promising single-agent anti-tumor activity in patients with heavily pretreated HER2-expressing cancers that have progressed after standard of care treatment, including multiple HER2-targeted regimens.

 Potential Advantages of ZW25 
 ZW25s biparatopic binding mode increases the number of antibodies bound to HER2 receptors at the cell surface relative to monospecific antibodies and promotes receptor clustering and internalization. 
 ZW25 mediates its therapeutic effect on HER2-expressing tumors through a combination of therapeutic mechanisms including: 
 

 | cross-linked trans HER2 binding and HER2 receptor clustering;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


 | enhanced antibody internalization and HER2 downregulation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | increased maximum binding density and potent effector function-mediated cytotoxicity; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | enhanced blockade of ligand-dependent and ligand-independent tumor growth.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clinical Development of ZW25 
 A first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial for ZW25 commenced in September 2016, consisting of three segments. We have completed Part 1, the dose escalation segment, and identified the Phase 2 recommended dose and schedule of ZW25 as 20 mg/kg every other week. Part 2 and Part 3 of the Phase 1 clinical trial are underway and consist of five expansion cohorts that span HER2 High breast cancer, HER2 High gastric cancer, HER2 Intermediate breast cancer, HER2 Intermediate gastric cancer, and other HER2 gene amplified cancers to evaluate ZW25 as both a monotherapy (Part 2) and in combination with standard of care chemotherapy (Part 3). 
 ZW25 has been well tolerated with promising single-agent anti-tumor activity in patients with heavily pre-treated HER2-expressing cancer that progressed after standard of care, including multiple HER2-targeted regimens. 
 These data were highlighted at several medical conferences in 2018, including the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics sponsored by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR). 
 At the ASCO annual meeting, we presented a snapshot of the clinical database from April 18, 2018, highlighting 18 response-evaluable (defined as having measurable disease and at least one tumor restaging or clinical progression) breast cancer patients with a median of six prior systemic regimens, including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, T-DM1, and lapatinib. The disease control rate (percentage of patients with either a partial response or stable disease) in these patients was 50%. 
 At the Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, updated clinical data included 24 gastroesophageal and other cancer patients treated at 10 mg/kg weekly or 20 mg/kg every other week (the Phase 2 recommended dose), of which 17 were response-evaluable at the time of data cut-off (October 16, 2018). The disease control rate in these patients was 82%. 
 Overall in the study, ZW25 was well tolerated and the majority of treatment-related adverse events were Grade 1 or 2. There were no treatment-related Grade 4 or 5 adverse events. 
 ZW49: HER2-Targeted Bispecific ADC 
 Overview 
 ZW49, our second product candidate, is currently being evaluated in an adaptive Phase 1 clinical trial. It is a biparatopic anti-HER2 ADC that is based on the same antibody framework as ZW25 and takes advantage of ZW25s antibody-targeted internalization to deliver our proprietary ZymeLink cytotoxic payload. We are developing ZW49 as a best-in-class HER2-targeting ADC for several indications characterized by HER2 
 
5 


  expression, especially for patients whose tumors have progressed or are refractory to HER2-targeted agents and those that express lower levels of HER2 and are ineligible for treatment with HER2-targeted therapies including T-DM1.
Potential Advantages of ZW49 
 ZW49 is a combination of an Azymetric biparatopic anti-HER2 antibody conjugated to our proprietary ZymeLink cytotoxic payload via a cleavable linker. Our cytotoxic payload destabilizes tubulin, a protein necessary for cell division, and therefore selectively kills rapidly dividing cancer cells. Compared to existing HER2-targeted therapies, ZW49 mediates a superior therapeutic effect on HER2-expressing tumors through a combination of mechanisms, including: 

 | cross-linked trans HER2 binding and HER2 receptor clustering;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


 | increased HER2-mediated antibody internalization leading to:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


 | enhanced toxin-mediated cytotoxicity and tumor growth inhibition;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | enhanced HER2 downregulation;
--+------------------------------


 | increased maximum binding density and potent effector-function mediated cytotoxicity; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | enhanced blockade of ligand-dependent and ligand-independent tumor growth.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Development of ZW49 
 In preclinical studies, ZW49 demonstrated complete tumor regressions in a panel of high and low HER2-expressing patient-derived xenografts and promising efficacy in a model of breast cancer brain metastases. These results compared favorably when benchmarked against approved and leading HER2 ADCs in clinical development. In a repeat dose toxicology study in non-human primates, ZW49 was well tolerated at 18 mg/kg, suggesting a broad therapeutic window. 
 Anticipated Clinical Development of ZW49 
 We are currently evaluating ZW49 as a monotherapy in a non-randomized, open-label Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with HER2 High breast, gastric and other HER2-expressing cancers, whose disease has progressed after all standard of care therapies. The primary objective of the Phase 1 clinical trial is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and maximum tolerated dose of ZW49. The secondary objectives for the trial include evaluation of preliminary anti-tumor activity of ZW49, as well as an exploration of potential biomarkers of response. Based upon the observed safety and activity, subsequent development may focus on patients with HER2 High breast cancer, HER2 High gastric cancer, other HER2 High cancers, as well as cancers with lower levels of HER2 expression, including breast cancer. 
Other Product Candidates 
 We maintain ongoing discovery efforts to identify and test new target combinations, product candidates and platform technologies that have the potential to address unmet clinical needs. We have developed multiple undisclosed preclinical product candidates targeting a combination of known and novel tumor antigens based on our platform technologies. All of these candidates remain unpartnered. We will continue to focus on advancing multiple well-differentiated product candidates into clinical trials to build our pipeline portfolio as well as exploiting our protein engineering expertise to develop innovative therapeutic platforms. 
Strategic Partnerships and Collaborations 
 Our Strategic Partnerships 
 Our novel therapeutic candidates, together with the unique combination of proprietary protein engineering capabilities and resulting therapeutic platform technologies have enabled us to enter into a number of strategic 
 
6 


  partnerships, many of which were subsequently expanded in scope. In 2018, we entered into new or expanded licensing and collaboration agreements with Daiichi Sankyo, Celgene, LEO and BeiGene. 
 Our strategic partnerships provide us with the ability to accelerate clinical development of our therapeutic candidates in certain geographical regions and provide our strategic partners with access to components of our proprietary Azymetric and/or EFECT therapeutic platforms for their own therapeutics development. These strategic partnerships have provided us with non-dilutive funding as well as access to proprietary therapeutic assets, which increase our ability to rapidly advance our product candidates while maintaining commercial rights to our own therapeutic pipeline. To date, we have received $172.8 million in the form of non-refundable upfront payments and milestone payments and are additionally eligible to receive up to $2.4 billion in preclinical and development milestone payments and $5.2 billion in commercial milestone payments available under our existing collaboration agreements, as well as tiered royalties on potential future product sales. It is possible, however, that our strategic partners programs will not advance as currently contemplated, which would negatively affect the amount of development and commercial milestone payments and royalties on potential future product sales we may receive. Importantly, these partnerships include predominantly non-target-exclusive licenses for any of our therapeutic platforms, so we maintain the ability to develop therapeutics directed to many high-value targets utilizing our platforms.

We will also supplement internal innovation through in-licensing of new technologies and compositions of matter as appropriate. We intend to take advantage of any available data exclusivity, market exclusivity, patent term adjustment and patent term extensions. 
 We routinely monitor the status of existing and emerging intellectual property disclosed by third parties that may impact our business, and to the extent we identify any such disclosures, by evaluating them and taking appropriate courses of action. 
 As of December 31, 2018, our patent portfolio consists of 54 active patent families. Of these, 16 families relate to our key product candidates and programs including ZW25, ZW49 and our therapeutic platform technology. The remaining 38 patent families relate to other earlier stage potential product candidates or platforms that we do not consider material to our business at this time. Three of our patent families are co-owned with VAR2 Pharmaceuticals ApS, and one patent family is co-owned with the National Research Council Canada. None of these co-owned patent families relate to our therapeutic platforms or our lead product candidates, ZW25 and ZW49, and they are not material to our business. We have 64 issued patents, 22 of which are U.S. patents, and all of which are owned by us. 
 Therapeutic Antibody Portfolio 
 Our therapeutic antibody patent portfolio is directed to specific compositions of matter and methods of treatment for our product candidates, including target-specific interactions and immunomodulatory mechanisms. 

 | ZW25 and ZW49: We own the ZW25 and ZW49 patent portfolio, including an international patent application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) that is now in the national phase with applications pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia and the United States. This application relates to the composition of matter, methods of making and uses of biparatopic anti-HER2 bispecific antibodies and ADCs, and if issued, is expected to expire in 2034, absent any adjustments or extensions. One U.S. patent has issued. An additional PCT application is directed to additional treatment methods using ZW25. We have filed three U.S. provisional applications covering ZW49 composition of matter and methods of making and using ZW49. Any patents that issue from applications claiming priority to these U.S. provisional applications are expected to expire in 2039, absent and adjustments or extensions.

 | Azymetric: We own a portfolio of six patent families relating to the Azymetric platform for engineering Fc and Fab constructs for the development of bispecific antibodies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Azymetric Fc: Two of the patent families relate to engineered antibody Fc region polypeptides having amino acid substitutions that preferentially form heterodimers, with PCT national phase applications pending or issued in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia and the United States. One U.S. patent has issued with 1,102 days of patent term adjustment and is 
 
11 


  expected to expire on November 10, 2034. A second U.S. patent has issued with 372 days of patent term adjustment and is expected to expire on November 9, 2033. If issued, the remaining patents in these families are expected to expire between 2031 and 2032, absent any adjustments or extensions. An additional issued U.S. patent covers method of expressing antibodies containing heterodimeric Fc regions in cells. 
 Azymetric Fab: Four patent families (three in the PCT national phase in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia and the United States, and one PCT application) relate to antibodies having amino acid substitutions in Fab-region heavy and light chains for making correctly paired bispecific antibodies. Two U.S. patents have issued. These patent families are directed to compositions, methods of producing and uses of heterodimeric antibodies. If issued, patents in these families are expected to expire between 2031 and 2038, absent any adjustments or extensions. 
 

 | ZymeLink: We own the ZymeLink patent portfolio relating to novel toxin molecules and novel linkers by means of which these toxins can be conjugated to antibodies and other protein scaffolds. Two PCT applications are in the national phase in key jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, South Africa and the United States, and are directed to novel hemiasterlin toxin derivatives, novel linker compositions, hemiasterlin-linker compositions, and antibody-hemiasterlin conjugate compositions, one of which has issued in the United States. An additional PCT application is directed to novel auristatin derivatives, auristatin-linker compositions and antibody-auristatin conjugates and is in the national phase in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia, Singapore and the United States. One U.S. patent has issued. Any patents that may issue from these families are expected to expire between 2034 and 2037, absent any adjustments or extensions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | EFECT: The EFECT platform for engineering Fc constructs with modulated FCYR-binding and Fc effector function is protected by two PCT patent applications, which we own, both of which are in the national stage and are pending in key jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Russia and the United States. One patent has issued in the United States. These patent families are directed to compositions of matter and methods of making Fc constructs with altered FCYR-binding and Fc effector function; if issued, they are expected to expire between 2031 and 2034, absent any adjustments or extensions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Computational Chemistry: We own a portfolio of 13 families of computational chemistry patents and patent applications which relate to the computational and algorithmic advances incorporated into the ZymeCAD suite of applications, including advances in general molecular modeling, conformational dynamics, docking, distal mutations, and molecular packing, as well as parallelization and graphical data analysis. Six of these patents have issued in the United States. Any patents that issue from these families are expected to expire between 2027 and 2035, absent any adjustments or extensions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Technology Licensing and In-Licensed Intellectual Property 
 We identify and selectively enter into technology licensing agreements and intellectual property in-licensing agreements to support pipeline advancement. Selected agreements include: 
 

 | CDRD Ventures Inc. (CVI; 2016): We entered into an assignment agreement with CVI, as part of our 2016 acquisition of Kairos Therapeutics Inc. (Kairos) to have all of CVIs interests in the Kairos patents and intellectual property assigned to Zymeworks. We may be required to make future payments to CVI for ZW49 or other product candidates upon the direct achievement of certain clinical development milestones for products incorporating certain Kairos intellectual property, as well as low single-digit royalty payments on the net sales of such products. For out-licensed products and technologies incorporating certain Kairos intellectual property, we may be required to pay CVI a mid-single-digit percentage of the future revenue as a result of a revenue sharing agreement.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Innovative Targeting Solutions Inc. (ITS; 2016): We entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with ITS which grants us the right to use ITS HuTARG discovery platform for the
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
12 


 
generation of therapeutic antibodies and other protein therapeutics. Pursuant to this agreement, ITS granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide, sub-licensable commercial license to its technology for the development of our internal therapeutic programs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manufacturing 
 We rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations to provide manufacturing, linker-toxin conjugation, and fill-finish services in order to generate all of the therapeutic antibody supply required for our non-clinical and clinical studies. To retain focus on our expertise in developing new product candidates, we do not currently plan to develop or operate in-house manufacturing capacity. Our bispecific therapeutic antibody candidates require standard manufacturing and chemistry manufacturing and control (CMC) processes typical of those required for monoclonal antibody manufacturing. We therefore expect to continue to be able to develop product candidates that can be manufactured in a cost-effective fashion by our network of well-validated third-party contract manufacturing organizations. 
 Through our contract manufacturing organizations, we currently have sufficient supply of our product candidates to carry out ongoing and planned preclinical studies. For ZW25, we also have sufficient current good manufacturing practices (cGMP)-grade supply, together with planned additional manufacturing runs, to complete our Phase 1 clinical trial and to initiate planned Phase 2 clinical trials. For ZW49, we have sufficient cGMP-grade supply, together with planned additional manufacturing runs, to complete our Phase 1 clinical trial. We plan to identify redundant suppliers and manufacturing, toxin conjugation, and fill-finish services for all development product candidates prior to submission to the FDA. 
 Competition 
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 With respect to target discovery activities, competitors and other third parties, including academic and clinical researchers, may be able to access rare families and identify targets before we do. 
 Many of the companies against which we compete or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaboration arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites, recruiting patients for clinical trials, and by acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience and price, the effectiveness of alternative products, the level of competition and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products or therapies that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or 
 
13 


  are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, European Medicines Agency (EMA) or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. 
 Our product candidates will compete with the therapies and currently marketed drugs discussed below. 
 

 | ZW25 and ZW49: ZW25 and ZW49 are intended to treat patients with solid tumors that express HER2, including patients with tumors expressing low to intermediate levels of HER2. Approved HER2-targeted therapies include Roches Herceptin, Perjeta, and Kadcyla as well as Novartis Tykerb and Puma Biotechnologys Nerlynx, although none of these drugs are effective in treating tumors expressing low to intermediate levels of HER2. Currently, these patients may receive hormone therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapy including combinations of anthracyclines, taxanes, capecitabine and cyclophosphamide. We believe ZW25 will be a more effective and better tolerated therapy. There are other non-HER2 targeting monoclonal antibodies on the market that may have activity on tumors expressing low to intermediate levels of HER2, including Mercks Keytruda, Bristol-Myer Squibbs Opdivo, Roches Tecentriq, Merck KGaAs Bavencio and AstraZenecas Imfinzi; however, none of these agents are currently approved in breast or ovarian cancer, and only Keytruda is approved in gastric cancer (albeit as third-line salvage therapy in patients that are PD-L1 positive). Since antibodies blocking PD-1/PD-L1 are relatively well-tolerated and have a different mechanism of action than ZW25, if approved in these indications, we believe PD-1/PD-L1 blockade could potentially be used in combination with ZW25 to achieve even higher response rates.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA and corresponding regulatory authorities will ultimately review our clinical results and determine whether our product candidates are effective. No regulatory agency has made any such determination that any of our product candidates are effective for use by the general public for any indication. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our ADC product candidates are comprised of both a drug product and a biologic product, and will therefore be subject to regulation in the United States as combination products. If marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and would require approval of independent marketing applications by the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to an FDA center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination products primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of our ADCs, we believe that the primary mode of action is attributable to the biologic component of the product. Thus, we believe our product candidates will be regulated as therapeutic biologics, with the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) having primary jurisdiction over premarket development. 
 Biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries.

 U.S. Biological Products Development Process 
 The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

 | completion of extensive nonclinical, sometimes referred to as preclinical, laboratory tests and preclinical animal trials and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including good laboratory practices (GLPs);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDAs regulations commonly referred to as current good clinical practice (cGCP) regulations and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological products identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase 1. The biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human volunteers and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2. The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labelling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 4. Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive reporting, monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. 
 
15 


 A sponsor, an IRB, the FDA or other regulatory or monitoring authorities may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or clinical protocols, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using the investigational drug, changes in government regulations or administrative actions. 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. When a BLA is submitted, the FDA conducts a preliminary review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to be accepted for filing. If it is not, the FDA may refuse to file the application and request additional information, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information, and review of the application is delayed. Upon accepting the BLA for filing, the FDA will conduct an in-depth review the BLA and may hold a public hearing where an independent advisory committee of expert advisors considers key questions regarding the product candidate. This advisory committee makes a recommendation to the FDA, which is not binding on the FDA, but is generally followed. 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain applications for approval must include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the subject drug in relevant pediatric populations. The FDA may waive or defer the requirement for a pediatric assessment, either at the companys request or by the FDAs initiative. The FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks. A REMS may include various elements, ranging from a medication guide or patient package insert to limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, depending on what the FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the drug. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and cGCP requirements. 
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the applicant interprets the same data. If the FDA decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor (for example, requiring labeling changes) or major (for example, requiring additional clinical trials). Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the 
 
16 


  product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological products safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 The Orphan Drug Act established incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals in the United States at the time of the request for orphan designation. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition and meets other applicable requirements, the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation to the product for that use. ZW25 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of both gastric and ovarian cancer by the FDA. 
 The benefits of Orphan Drug Designation include tax credits for clinical testing expenses and exemption from user fees. A drug candidate that is approved for the orphan drug designated use typically is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity. However, the FDA Reauthorization Act, which was enacted in August 2017, requires, among other things, that certain orphan drugs for cancer be tested for children. The government has also increased focus on the potential misuse of the orphan drug approval process to increase the price of orphan drugs. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Even if regulatory approval is granted, a marketed product is subject to continuing comprehensive requirements under federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, including requirements and restrictions regarding adverse event reporting, recordkeeping, marketing, and compliance with cGMP. Adverse events reported after approval of a drug can result in additional restrictions on the use of a marketed product or requirements for additional post-marketing studies or clinical trials. 
 Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects and reporting updated safety and efficacy information. 
 Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements relating to the manufacturer or promotion of an approved product may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as significant administrative, civil or criminal sanctions. 
 
17 


 Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. 
 Under the BPCIA, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsors own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed interchangeable by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 Canadian Review and Approval Process 
 In Canada, our biologic product candidates and our research and development activities are primarily regulated by the Food and Drugs Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, which are enforced by Health Canada (including its Biologics and Genetic Therapies Directorate). Health Canada regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring, marketing and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Drug approval laws require licensing of manufacturing facilities, carefully controlled research and testing of products, and government review and approval of experimental results prior to giving approval to sell drug products, including biologic drug products. Regulators also typically require that rigorous and specific standards such as cGMP, GLPand Practices cGCP are followed in the manufacture, testing and clinical development, respectively, of any drug product. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in Canada, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 The principal steps required for drug approval in Canada is as follows: 
 Preclinical Toxicology Studies 
 Non-clinical studies are conducted in vitro and in animals to evaluate pharmacokinetics, metabolism and possible toxic effects to provide evidence of the safety of the drug candidate prior to its administration to humans in clinical studies and throughout development. Such studies are conducted in accordance with applicable laws and GLP. 
Initiation of Human Testing 
 In Canada, the process of conducting clinical trials with a new drug cannot begin until we have submitted a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) and the required number of days has lapsed without objection from Health Canada. Biological drugs carry additional risks, as compared to traditional small-molecule drugs, associated with complexity and variability in manufacturing that can contribute to increased lot-to-lot variation of the final product, and with the potential for adventitious agents. Therefore, the content requirements for the quality information for biological drugs to be used in clinical trials are different from those for standard small-molecule pharmaceutical drugs (for example, the inclusion of information on manufacturing facilities is required for biological drugs). In addition, it is necessary to have more stringent controls on the release of biologic drug lots used in authorized clinical trials. 
 Similar regulations apply in Canada to a CTA as to an IND in the United States. Once approved, two key factors influencing the rate of progression of clinical trials are the rate at which patients can be enrolled to participate in 
 
18 


  the research program and whether effective treatments are currently available for the disease that the drug is intended to treat. Patient enrollment is largely dependent upon the incidence and severity of the disease, the treatments available and the potential side effects of the drug to be tested and any restrictions for enrollment that may be imposed by regulatory agencies. 
 Clinical Trials 
 Similar regulations apply in Canada regarding clinical trials as in the United States. In Canada, Research Ethics Boards (REBs), instead of IRBs, are used to review and approve clinical trial plans. Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP requirements, which include review and approval by REBs. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated and a statistical analysis plan. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, as discussed above in the context of government regulation in the United States. 
 The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into Canada are also subject to regulation by Health Canada relating to their labeling and distribution. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must generally be submitted at least annually to Health Canada and/or the applicable REBs, and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, in Canada, Health Canada or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an REB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the REBs requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of trial subjects, potential trial subjects and the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate. 
 New Drug Application 
 Upon successful completion of Phase 3 clinical trials, in Canada the company sponsoring a new drug then assembles all the preclinical and clinical data and other testing relating to the products pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls, and submits it to Health Canada as part of a New Drug Submission (NDS). The NDS is then reviewed by Health Canada for approval to market the drug. 
 As part of the approval process, Health Canada will generally inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. Health Canada will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDS contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. In addition, before approving an NDS, Health Canada will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. 
 The testing and approval process for an NDS requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and may take several years to complete. Biologic drugs, such as our candidates, differ from standard small-molecule drugs in that applicants must include more detailed chemistry and manufacturing information. This is necessary to help ensure the purity and quality of the product, for example to help ensure that it is not contaminated by an undesired microorganism. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Health Canada may not grant approval of an NDS on a timely basis, or at all. In Canada, NDSs are subject to user fees and these fees are typically increased annually to reflect inflation.

 Even if Health Canada approves a product candidate, the relevant authority may limit the approved indications for use of the product candidate, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a black box warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drugs safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms. 
 Biologic products in particular are monitored post-approval by being placed on a lot-release schedule tailored to their potential risk, manufacturing, testing and inspection history to date. With higher risk biologics, each lot is tested before being released for sale in Canada. Moderate risk biologics are periodically tested at the discretion of Health Canada while manufacturers of low-risk biologics usually only need to contact Health Canada regarding lots being sold or for providing certification of complete and satisfactory testing. Products are carefully scrutinized before they are placed in any level of the lot-release process, and at any time the testing regime for a biologic may be altered. 
 Health Canada may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements, notification, and regulatory authority review and approval. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling or regulatory notification may be required. 
 Canadian Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
 The term biosimilar is used by Health Canada to describe a biologic drug that enters the market subsequent to a version previously authorized in Canada and with demonstrated similarity to a reference biologic drug. Accordingly, a biosimilar (previously known in Canada as a subsequent entry biologic or SEB) will in all instances be a subsequent entrant onto the Canadian market. 
 Based on Health Canada guidance documents, a biosimilar can rely in part on prior information regarding safety and efficacy that is deemed relevant due to the demonstration of similarity to the reference biologic drug and which influences the amount and type of original data required. Generic drugs are chemically derived products that are pharmaceutically equivalent to innovative drugs, whereas biosimilars are products of a biologic nature that are similar to innovative biologics. According to Health Canada, it is not currently possible to demonstrate that two biologic drugs are pharmaceutically equivalent, and therefore the regulatory approval process for generics and biosimilar is different: biosimilar are approved using the standard NDS pathway with some allowances made for reduced safety and efficacy information set out in guidance documents, while generic drugs are approved using an abbreviated new drug submission pathway set in guidance law. In part because it continues to be set out only in guidance and not law, the pathway for receiving biosimilar approval is somewhat in flux and subject to some uncertainty. 
 As discussed above, all biosimilars enter the market subsequent to a biologic drug product previously approved in Canada and to which the biosimilar is considered similar. As such, biosimilars are subject to existing laws and regulations outlined in the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations and the Food and Drug Regulations, and related guidance documents. 
 Similar to the Hatch-Waxman Act in the United States, Canada has the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations which require a company that files a drug submission that references a patented product to address any relevant patents listed on the Patent Register prior to being able to receive approval from Health Canada. The Canadian regime is similar to the U.S. regime, but a number of distinctions do exist. 
 Like the United States, Canada also has data protection in addition to patent protection, but again differences exist between the two jurisdictions. For example, Canadas data protection applies to innovative drugs (i.e., a 
 
20 


  drug that contains a medicinal ingredient not previously approved in a drug by the Minister of Health and that is not a variation of a previously approved medicinal ingredient such as a salt, ester, enantiomer, solvate or polymorph) and, where it exists, lasts for eight years in most (but not all) circumstances. In general biologics can be considered innovative drugs but biosimilars are not. 
 The recently signed United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) requires parties to the trade agreement to provide a data protection term for biologics of at least ten years from the date of first marketing approval, which in the case of Canada results in an additional two years of data protection specifically for biologics. If the USMCA is ratified, this additional data protection in Canada is expected to be implemented within five years of when the USMCA comes into force. 
 Additional Regulation 
 In addition to the foregoing, provincial, state and federal U.S. and Canadian laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 
Government Regulation Outside of the United States 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. 
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the European Union (EU), for example, a CTA must be submitted to each countrys national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a countrys requirements, clinical study development may proceed. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, coverage, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with cGCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. These third-party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Third-party payors may attempt to control costs by limiting coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication, requiring pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies, and by limiting the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug 
 
21 


  products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are often used as models by private payors and other governmental payors to develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. However, one third-party payors decision to cover a particular drug product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. 
 The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products to obtain third-party payor coverage, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A payors decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and to operate profitably. 
 In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost effective by third-party payors, that coverage or an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that third-party payors reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our future products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 
 We expect that the PPACA, as well as reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs, once regulatory approval is obtained. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general, and other state and local government agencies.

 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the U.S. federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. We may also be subject to additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement with a governmental entity to resolve allegations that we have violated these laws. To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-approval requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 As an early-stage biopharmaceutical company, we do not currently possess the commercial infrastructure required to launch and market our product candidates. For ZW25 and ZW49, we have entered into development and commercialization agreements with BeiGene whereby BeiGene is responsible for certain clinical development activities and all commercial activities in Asia (excluding Japan but including the Peoples Republic of China, South Korea and other countries), Australia and New Zealand. To date, we have not entered into any other agreements granting commercialization rights to ZW25, ZW49 or any of our other product candidates. To access the sales, marketing and distribution capacity required to market our drug candidates, we plan to selectively establish additional partnerships with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies having established commercial capabilities in relevant indications. The timing and nature of such agreements will be determined by market size and complexity, access to pre-commercial and commercial infrastructure and our resource availability for developing a commercial organization. For product candidates targeting patient populations that can be serviced by a small, specialized commercial effort, we may seek out co-development and co-promotion agreements granting commercialization rights to an established commercial partner in some jurisdictions while allowing us to build these capabilities in other jurisdictions. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 183 employees, including 180 full-time employees, 117 of whom were primarily engaged in research and development activities and 54 of whom hold an M.D. or Ph.D. degree. 145 of our full-time employees are based in Vancouver, British Columbia and 35 in Seattle, Washington. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization or covered by a collective bargaining arrangement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be excellent. 
Corporate Structure
