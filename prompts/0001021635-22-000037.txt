Item 1. Business.
Introduction

OGE Energy, incorporated in August 1995 in the State of Oklahoma, is a holding company with investments in energy and energy services providers offering physical delivery and related services for electricity in Oklahoma and western Arkansas and natural gas, crude oil and NGLs across the U.S. OGE Energy conducts these activities through two business segments: (i) electric utility and (ii) natural gas midstream operations. 

Electric Utility Operations. OGE Energy's electric utility operations are conducted through OG&E, which generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. OG&E's rates are subject to regulation by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. OG&E was incorporated in 1902 under the laws of the Oklahoma Territory and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of OGE Energy. OG&E is the largest electric utility in Oklahoma, and its franchised service territory includes Fort Smith, Arkansas and the surrounding communities. OG&E sold its retail natural gas business in 1928 and is no longer engaged in the natural gas distribution business. 
Natural Gas Midstream Operations. On December 2, 2021, Energy Transfer completed its previously announced acquisition of Enable. Pursuant to and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, all outstanding common units of Enable were acquired by Energy Transfer in an all-equity transaction. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Enable's common unitholders, including OGE Energy, received 0.8595 of one common unit representing limited partner interests in Energy Transfer for each common unit of Enable. Therefore, on December 2, 2021, all of the 110,982,805 common units of Enable owned by OGE Energy were exchanged for 95,389,721 common units of Energy Transfer. As part of the transaction, Energy Transfer also acquired the general partner interests of Enable from OGE Energy and CenterPoint for cash consideration. Prior to December 2, 2021, OGE Energy's natural gas midstream operations segment represented OGE Energy's investment in Enable, which OGE Energy accounted for as an equity method investment. Formed in 2013, Enable was primarily engaged in the business of gathering, processing, transporting and storing natural gas, with natural gas gathering and processing assets located in four states which served natural gas production in the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex Basins. Enable also owned crude oil gathering assets in the Anadarko and Williston Basins and had natural gas transportation and storage assets located in Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle, Louisiana, Illinois and Alabama. For further discussion regarding Enable's business, see OGE Energy's 2020 Form 10-K. Upon the closing of the Energy Transfer and Enable merger, OGE Energy's natural gas midstream operations segment represents OGE Energy's investment in Energy Transfer's equity securities and legacy Enable seconded employee pension and postretirement costs. The investment in Energy Transfer's equity securities is held through wholly-owned subsidiaries and ultimately OGE Holdings. At December 31, 2021, OGE energy owned 95.4 million, or approximately three percent, of Energy Transfer's limited partner units. OGE Energy does not have board representation at and does not own general partner units of Energy Transfer. As such, OGE Energy accounts for its investment in Energy Transfer as an investment in equity securities. See "Natural Gas Midstream Operations - Energy Transfer" below for further discussion of Energy Transfer's business. OGE Energy intends to exit the midstream segment in a prudent manner.

Strategy

OGE Energy's purpose is to energize life, providing life-sustaining and life-enhancing products and services, while honoring its commitment to strengthen communities. Its business model is centered around growth and sustainability for employees (internally referred to as "members"), communities and customers and the owners of OGE Energy, its shareholders. 
OGE Energy is focused on: 
•delivering top-quartile safety results, while enabling members to deliver improved value to their communities, customers and shareholders;
•transforming the customer experience by centering decisions on customer impact that will drive customer operations, communications and the digital experience including increased personalization and self-service; 
•providing safe, reliable energy to the communities and customers it serves, with a particular focus on enhancing the value of the grid by improving reliability and resiliency; 
•leading economic development and job growth by attracting new and diverse businesses to improve the infrastructure of the communities in Oklahoma and Arkansas;
•ensuring the necessary mix of generation resources to meet the long-term capacity needs of our customers, with a progressively cleaner generation portfolio; 
•maintaining customer rates that are some of the most affordable in the country by continuing focus on innovation, intellectual curiosity and execution with excellence; 
•delivering on earnings commitments to shareholders to enhance access to lower-cost debt and equity capital that is needed to deploy infrastructure for the long-term economic health of its communities;
•having strong regulatory and legislative relationships, built on integrity, for the long-term benefit of our customers, communities, shareholders and members; and
•developing and growing our members to be able to provide a greater contribution to the company's success, while also improving their own lives.
OGE Energy is focused on creating long-term shareholder value by targeting the consistent growth of earnings per share of five to seven percent at the electric utility, supported by strong load growth enabled by low customer rates and a strategy of investing in lower risk infrastructure projects that improve the economic vitality of the communities it serves in Oklahoma and Arkansas. OGE Energy plans to fully exit its natural gas midstream operations segment by prudently selling its Energy Transfer units. OGE Energy will continue to utilize cash distributions from its natural gas midstream operations segment and reinvest the proceeds from the sale of Energy Transfer units to help fund its business. In the next five years, OGE Energy expects to continue to grow the dividend, targeting a dividend payout ratio of 65 to 70 percent based on utility earnings. Over the next several years, OGE Energy expects earnings per share growth to exceed the dividend growth rate to help achieve this target. OGE Energy's financial objectives also include maintaining investment grade credit ratings and providing a strong and reliable dividend for shareholders. 
OGE Energy's long-term sustainability is predicated on providing exceptional customer experiences, investing in grid improvements and increasingly cleaner generation resources, environmental stewardship, strong governance practices and caring for and supporting its members and communities.
Electric Operations - OG&E
General
OG&E provides retail electric utility service to approximately 879,000 customers in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. The service area covers 30,000 square miles including Oklahoma City, the largest city in Oklahoma, Fort Smith, Arkansas, the third largest city in that state, and other large communities with their contiguous rural and suburban areas throughout Oklahoma and western Arkansas. OG&E derived 92 percent of its total electric operating revenues in 2021 from sales in Oklahoma and the remainder from sales in Arkansas. OG&E does not currently serve wholesale customers in either state. 
In 2021, OG&E's system control area peak demand was 6,722 MWs on August 25, 2021, and OG&E's load responsibility peak demand was 5,896 MWs on August 25, 2021. The following table presents system sales and variations in system sales for 2021, 2020 and 2019.

Year Ended December 31 | 2021 | 2021 vs. 2020 | 2020 | 2020 vs. 2019 | 2019
System sales (Millions of MWh) | 27.7 | 2.6% | 27.0 | (4.9)% | 28.4

OG&E is subject to competition in various degrees from government-owned electric systems, municipally-owned electric systems, rural electric cooperatives and, in certain respects, from other private utilities, power marketers and cogenerators. Oklahoma law forbids the granting of an exclusive franchise to a utility for providing electricity.
Besides competition from other suppliers or marketers of electricity, OG&E competes with suppliers of other forms of energy. The degree of competition between suppliers may vary depending on relative costs and supplies of other forms of 
energy. It is possible that changes in regulatory policies or advances in technologies such as fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic solar cells will reduce costs of new technology to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production. OG&E's ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations is a significant determinant of its competitiveness.

Regulation and Rates
OG&E's retail electric tariffs are regulated by the OCC in Oklahoma and by the APSC in Arkansas. The issuance of certain securities by OG&E is also regulated by the OCC and the APSC. OG&E's transmission activities, short-term borrowing authorization and accounting practices are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. The Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy has jurisdiction over some of OG&E's facilities and operations. In 2021, 89 percent of OG&E's electric revenue was subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC, eight percent to the APSC and three percent to the FERC.

The OCC and the APSC require that, among other things, (i) OGE Energy permits the OCC and the APSC access to the books and records of OGE Energy and its affiliates relating to transactions with OG&E; (ii) OGE Energy employ accounting and other procedures and controls to protect against subsidization of non-utility activities by OG&E's customers; and (iii) OGE Energy refrain from pledging OG&E assets or income for affiliate transactions. In addition, the FERC has access to the books and records of OGE Energy and its affiliates as the FERC deems relevant to costs incurred by OG&E or necessary or appropriate for the protection of utility customers with respect to the FERC jurisdictional rates.
For information concerning OG&E's recently completed and currently pending regulatory proceedings, see Note 16 within "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
OG&E, as a regulated utility, is subject to accounting principles for certain types of rate-regulated activities, which provide that certain incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets, based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates. Management's expected recovery of deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment.
OG&E records certain incurred costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence, it is probable that the costs or obligations will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refund in future rates. Management continuously monitors the future recoverability of regulatory assets. When in management's judgment future recovery becomes impaired, the amount of the regulatory asset is adjusted, as appropriate. If OG&E were required to discontinue the application of accounting principles for certain types of rate-regulated activities for some or all of its operations, it could result in writing off the related regulatory assets or liabilities, which could have significant financial effects. See Note 1 within "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion of OG&E's regulatory assets and liabilities. 
Rate Structures
Oklahoma 
OG&E's standard tariff rates include a cost of service component (including an authorized return on capital) plus a fuel adjustment clause mechanism that allows OG&E to pass through to customers the actual cost of fuel and purchased power.
OG&E offers several alternative customer programs and rate options, as described below.
•Under OG&E's Smart Grid-enabled SmartHours programs, time-of-use and variable peak pricing rates offer customers the ability to save on their electricity bills by shifting some of the electricity consumption to off-peak times when demand for electricity is lowest. 
•The Guaranteed Flat Bill option for residential and small general service accounts allows qualifying customers the opportunity to purchase their electricity needs at a set monthly price for an entire year. 
•The Renewable Energy Credit purchase program, the Green Power Wind Rider and the Utility Solar Program are rate options that make renewable energy resources available as a voluntary option to all OG&E Oklahoma retail customers. OG&E's ownership and access to wind and solar resources makes the renewable option a possible choice in meeting the renewable energy needs of OG&E's conservation-minded customers. 
•Load Reduction is a voluntary load curtailment program that provides OG&E's commercial and industrial customers with the opportunity to curtail usage on a voluntary basis when power delivery system conditions merit curtailment action. Customers that curtail their usage will receive payment for their curtailment response. This voluntary curtailment program seeks customers that can curtail on most curtailment event days but may not be able to curtail every time that a curtailment event is required. 
•OG&E offers certain qualifying customers day-ahead price and flex price rate options which allow participating customers to adjust their electricity consumption based on price signals received from OG&E. The prices for the day-ahead price and flex price rate options are based on OG&E's projected next day hourly operating costs. 
OG&E has Public Schools-Demand and Public Schools Non-Demand rate classes that provide OG&E with flexibility to provide targeted programs for load management to public schools and their unique usage patterns. OG&E also provides service level, seasonal and time period fuel charge differentiation that allows customers to pay fuel costs that better reflect the underlying costs of providing electric service. Lastly, OG&E has a military base rider that demonstrates Oklahoma's continued commitment to its military partners. 
The previously discussed rate options, coupled with OG&E's other rate choices, provide many tariff options for OG&E's Oklahoma retail customers. The revenue impacts associated with these options are not determinable in future years because customers may choose to remain on existing rate options instead of volunteering for the alternative rate option choices. Revenue variations may occur in the future based upon changes in customers' usage characteristics if they choose alternative rate options.
Arkansas 
OG&E's standard tariff rates include a cost of service component (including an authorized return on capital) plus an energy cost recovery mechanism that allows OG&E to pass through to customers the actual cost of fuel and purchased power. OG&E's current rate order from the APSC includes a formula rate rider that provides for an annual adjustment to rates if the earned rate of return falls outside of a plus or minus 50 basis point dead-band around the allowed return on equity. Adjustments are limited to plus or minus four percent of revenue for each rate class for the 12 months preceding the test period. The initial term for the formula rate rider is not to exceed five years from the date of the APSC final order in the last general rate review, May 18, 2017, unless additional approval is obtained from the APSC. On October 1, 2021, OG&E filed a request to extend the Formula Rate Plan Rider for an additional five years and expects a decision from the APSC in April 2022.
OG&E offers several alternative customer programs and rate options, as described below.
•The time-of-use and variable peak pricing tariffs allow participating customers to save on their electricity bills by shifting some of the electricity consumption to off-peak times when demand for electricity is lowest. 
•The Renewable Energy Credit purchase program and the Universal Solar Program are rate options that make renewable energy resources available as a voluntary option to all OG&E Arkansas retail customers. OG&E's ownership and access to wind and solar resources makes the renewable option a possible choice in meeting the renewable energy needs of OG&E's conservation-minded customers. 
•Load Reduction is a voluntary load curtailment program that provides OG&E's commercial and industrial customers with the opportunity to curtail usage on a voluntary basis and receive a billing credit when OG&E's system conditions merit curtailment action. 
•OG&E offers certain qualifying customers day-ahead price and flex price rate options which allow participating customers to adjust their electricity consumption based on a price signal received from OG&E. The day-ahead price and flex price rate options are based on OG&E's projected next day hourly operating costs. 
Fuel Supply and Generation 
The following table presents the OG&E-generated energy produced and purchased and the weighted-average cost of fuel used, by type, for the last three years. 

 | Generation Mix (A) | Fuel Cost (B)(In cents/Kilowatt-Hour)
 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 
Natural gas | 48% | 62% | 59% | 11.907 | 2.077 | 2.188
Coal | 40% | 25% | 27% | 1.935 | 1.821 | 2.029
Renewable | 12% | 13% | 14% | — | — | — 
Total | 100% | 100% | 100% | 6.833 | 1.863 | 1.970

(A)Generation mix calculated as a percent of net MWhs generated and includes purchased power agreements. 
(B)Total fuel and purchased power weighted-average cost was 6.892, 2.117 and 2.534 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The increase in the weighted average cost of fuel in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to higher fuel prices as a result of Winter Storm Uri. The increase in coal as a percentage of generation mix was primarily in response to an increase in natural gas prices during 2021. The decrease in the weighted average cost of fuel in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower fuel prices. These fuel costs are generally recoverable through OG&E's fuel adjustment clauses that are approved by the OCC and the APSC, with the exception of Winter Storm Uri fuel costs which have been deferred to separate regulatory assets for recovery in each jurisdiction. See Notes 1 and 16 within "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion.
OG&E participates in the SPP Integrated Marketplace. As part of the Integrated Marketplace, the SPP has balancing authority responsibilities for its market participants. The SPP Integrated Marketplace functions as a centralized dispatch, where market participants, including OG&E, submit offers to sell power to the SPP from their resources and bid to purchase power from the SPP for their customers. The SPP Integrated Marketplace is intended to allow the SPP to optimize supply offers and demand bids based upon reliability and economic considerations and to determine which generating units will run at any given time for maximum cost-effectiveness within the SPP area. As a result, OG&E's generating units produce output that is different from OG&E's customer load requirements. Net fuel and purchased power costs are generally recoverable through fuel adjustment clauses.
Of OG&E's 7,207 total MWs of generation capability reflected in the table within "Item 2. Properties," 4,876 MWs, or 67.7 percent, are from natural gas generation, 1,534 MWs, or 21.3 percent, are from coal generation, 321 MWs, or 4.4 percent, are from dual-fuel generation (coal/gas), 449 MWs, or 6.2 percent, are from wind generation and 27 MWs, or 0.4 percent, are from solar generation. 
Natural Gas
As a participant in the SPP Integrated Marketplace, OG&E purchases its natural gas supply through short-term agreements. OG&E relies on a combination of natural gas base load agreements and call agreements, whereby OG&E has the right but not the obligation to purchase a defined quantity of natural gas, combined with day and intra-day purchases to meet the demands of the SPP Integrated Marketplace. 
Coal
OG&E's coal-fired units are designed to burn primarily low sulfur western sub-bituminous coal. The combination of all 2021 coal purchased had a weighted average sulfur content of 0.2 percent. Based on the average sulfur content and EPA-certified data, OG&E's coal units have an approximate emission rate of 0.1 lbs. of SO2 per MMBtu. 
For the first two quarters of 2022, OG&E has coal supply agreements for 100 percent of its coal requirements for the Sooner, Muskogee and River Valley facilities. OG&E plans to fill the remainder of its 2022 coal needs through additional term agreements, spot purchases and the use of existing inventory. OG&E has no coal agreements beyond June 2022 and will need to satisfy its coal needs through term agreements and spot purchases. In 2021, OG&E purchased 4.393 million tons of coal from its sub-bituminous suppliers and 0.0373 million tons from its bituminous suppliers. See "Environmental Laws and Regulations" within "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a discussion of environmental matters which may affect OG&E in the future, including its utilization of coal.
Wind
OG&E owns the 120 MW Centennial, 101 MW OU Spirit and 228 MW Crossroads wind farms. OG&E's current wind power portfolio also includes purchased power contracts as presented in the following table. 

Company | Location | Original Term of Contract | Expiration of Contract | MWs 
CPV Keenan | Woodward County, OK | 20 years | 2030 | 152.0
Edison Mission Energy | Dewey County, OK | 20 years | 2031 | 130.0
NextEra Energy | Blackwell, OK | 20 years | 2032 | 60.0 

Solar 
OG&E currently owns and operates the solar sites presented in the following table.

Name | Location | Year Completed | Photovoltaic Panels | MWs
Mustang | Oklahoma City, OK | 2015 | 9,867 | 2.5
Covington | Covington, OK | 2018 | 38,000 | 9.7
Choctaw Nation | Durant, OK | 2020 | 15,344 | 5.0
Chickasaw Nation | Davis, OK | 2020 | 15,344 | 5.0
Branch | Branch, AR | 2021 | 15,444 | 5.0
Durant 2 | Durant, OK | 2022* | 15,471 | 5.0

* Performance testing is currently being completed.
In October 2021, OG&E issued its most recent IRP to the OCC and APSC that proposes to expand its renewable generation fleet, including the development of additional solar resources beginning in 2023. OG&E will continue to evaluate the need to add additional solar sites to its generation portfolio based on customer demand, cost and reliability. 
Safety and Health Regulation

OG&E is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including OSHA, the EPA and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the safety and health of workers.
In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, the EPA Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know regulations under Title III of the Federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials stored, used or produced in OG&E's operations and that this information be provided or made available to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. OG&E believes that it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker safety and health. 
In September 2021, President Biden announced an executive order requiring federal contractors to require that their employees be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 (the "vaccine mandate"). At this time, the Registrants will not be required to incorporate the language of the vaccine mandate into OG&E's area-wide service contracts, and therefore, the Registrants are not deemed federal contractors for these purposes. Consequently, the Registrants do not currently have to comply with the vaccine mandate. In September 2021, President Biden also announced a proposed new rule requiring all employers with at least 100 employees to require that their employees be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or tested weekly (the "testing mandate"). On January 25, 2022, OSHA announced it is currently focusing on implementing a permanent COVID-19 healthcare standard, similar to the testing mandate. The Registrants are monitoring this development and potential impact to their operations.
Natural Gas Midstream Operations - Energy Transfer
Energy Transfer owns and operates one of the largest and most diversified portfolios of energy assets in North America, with a strategic footprint in all of the major U.S. production basins. Energy Transfer is a publicly traded limited partnership with core operations that include complementary natural gas midstream, intrastate and interstate transportation and storage assets; crude oil, NGL and refined product transportation and terminalling assets; and NGL fractionation. In addition, Energy Transfer owns investments in other businesses, including Sunoco LP and USA Compression Partners, LP, both of which are publicly traded master limited partnerships.
•Energy Transfer's natural gas intrastate transportation pipelines receive natural gas from other mainline transportation pipelines, storage facilities and gathering systems and deliver the natural gas to industrial end-users, storage facilities, utilities, power generators and other third-party pipelines. Energy Transfer operates one of the largest intrastate pipeline systems in the U.S. providing energy logistics to major trading hubs and industrial consumption areas throughout the U.S. Energy Transfer's intrastate transportation and storage business focuses on the transportation of natural gas to major markets from prolific natural gas producing areas such as Permian, Barnett, Haynesville and Eagle Ford Shale. 
•Energy Transfer's interstate natural gas transportation pipelines receive natural gas from supply sources including other transportation pipelines, storage facilities and gathering systems and deliver the natural gas to industrial end-users and other pipelines. Energy Transfer's interstate natural gas network spans the U.S. from Florida to 
California and Texas to Michigan, offering a comprehensive array of pipeline and storage services. Energy Transfer's pipelines have the capability to transport natural gas from nearly all Lower 48 onshore and offshore supply basins to customers in the Southeast, Gulf Coast, Southwest, Midwest, Northeast and Canada.
•Energy Transfer owns and operates natural gas gathering and NGL pipelines, natural gas processing plants, natural gas treating facilities and natural gas conditioning facilities. Energy Transfer's midstream operations are currently concentrated in major producing basins and shales in South Texas, West Texas, New Mexico, North Texas, East Texas, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas and Louisiana. Many of Energy Transfer's midstream assets are integrated with their intrastate transportation and storage assets.
•Energy Transfer's NGL operations transport, store and execute acquisition and marketing activities utilizing a complementary network of pipelines, storage and blending facilities, and strategic off-take locations that provide access to multiple NGL markets. Energy Transfer's refined products operations provide transportation and terminalling services through the use of refined products pipelines and refined products marketing terminals, which are located primarily in the northeast, midwest and southwest U.S.
•Energy Transfer's crude oil operations provide transportation (via pipeline and trucking), terminalling and acquisition and marketing services to crude oil markets throughout the southwest, midwest, northwestern and northeastern U.S. Energy Transfer's crude oil acquisition and marketing activities utilize their pipeline and terminal assets, their proprietary fleet crude oil tractor trailers and truck unloading facilities, as well as third-party assets, to service crude oil markets principally in the midcontinent U.S.
Environmental Matters

General

The activities of the Registrants are subject to numerous stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection. These laws and regulations can change, restrict or otherwise impact the Registrants' business activities in many ways, including the handling or disposal of waste material, planning for future construction activities to avoid or mitigate harm to threatened or endangered species and requiring the installation and operation of emissions or pollution control equipment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Management believes that all of the Registrants' operations are in substantial compliance with current federal, state and local environmental standards. 
President Biden's Administration has taken a number of actions that adopt policies and affect environmental regulations, including issuance of executive orders that instruct the EPA and other executive agencies to review certain rules that affect OG&E with a view to achieving nationwide reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. OG&E is monitoring these actions which are in various stages of being implemented. At this point in time, the impacts of these actions on the Registrants' results of operations, if any, cannot be determined with any certainty. In the meantime, the Registrants continue to have obligations to take or complete action under current environmental rules. 
Management continues to evaluate the Registrants' compliance with existing and proposed environmental legislation and regulations and implement appropriate environmental programs in a competitive market but at the current time, based on existing rules, does not expect capital expenditures for environmental control facilities to be material for 2022 or 2023. For further discussion of environmental matters and capital expenditures related to environmental factors that may affect the Registrants, see "2021 Capital Requirements, Sources of Financing and Financing Activities," "Future Capital Requirements" and "Environmental Laws and Regulations" within "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Human Capital Management
Our company fulfills a critical role in the nation's electric utility infrastructure. In order to do so, we believe we need to attract, retain, motivate and develop a high quality, diverse workforce and provide a safe, inclusive and productive work environment for everyone. Our company's core values are teamwork, transparency, respect, integrity, public service, and individual safety and well-being. Our company's core beliefs are unleash potential, live safely, achieve together, create shared trust, value diversity and inclusion, take charge and values matter. We believe that our company's values and beliefs serve as a foundation for our relationships with our employees, who we refer to internally as "members" of the Registrants. These core values and beliefs are reinforced to all employees at the time of hire, annually through a review of our Code of Ethics and periodically through small and large group meetings. We believe the efforts described herein, among others, contribute to our members' sense of purpose for the work we perform and result in the retention of our members. At December 31, 2021, OGE Energy had 2,185 employees, of which 1,812 are OG&E employees. 
Total Rewards
To help us attract and retain the most qualified individuals for our businesses, we provide a combination of strong compensation and comprehensive benefit offerings, including healthcare, health savings and flexible spending accounts, short-term and long-term incentive plans, retirement savings plans with company matching contributions, disability coverage, paid time off, parental leave and employee assistance programs. We also have a defined benefit pension plan that covers certain employees hired on or before December 1, 2009. Our employees are also offered two days of paid volunteer leave every year, which is intended to further enrich both their lives and the lives of others in the communities we serve. 
Employee Recruiting, Development and Engagement
We make it a priority to attract, retain, motivate and develop a high-quality workforce. Our recruitment efforts begin with industry and career awareness efforts directed toward learning institutions, parents and students. We have built partnerships with universities, state career tech systems, state education departments, technical learning/trade schools, military bases and local school districts to increase awareness of the employment opportunities we provide and the total rewards packages that are tied to those opportunities. We build these relationships to create talent pipelines that will funnel qualified individuals back to our organization and the workforce needs we have identified. 
We provide our employees with a variety of opportunities for career growth and development. Many of the positions in our company are highly specialized, so having appropriate training and succession planning is critical to business continuity and competitiveness. We provide leadership, career development and skill-building opportunities, including internal and external training as well as tuition reimbursement, to invest in the next generation of leaders for our company. The number of annual hours of training per employee that we target, and historically average, aligns with the benchmark published annually by the American Society of Training and Development. 
OGE Energy, like many utilities across the country, is planning for and managing the effects of turnover of our workforce due to a significant number of retirements occurring now and expected during the next five to ten years, which is a period that will be impacted by major transformation of our business through technology investments, regulatory changes to our electric generation portfolio and upgrades to our distribution infrastructure. Management engages in ongoing succession planning discussions, which includes the annual involvement of OGE Energy's Board of Directors as it relates to officer succession planning.
OGE Energy conducts and/or participates in employee engagement surveys to seek feedback from its employees on a variety of topics, including understanding of and alignment with the company's strategy, objectives, values and beliefs, management practices, operational performance and the employee value proposition. OGE Energy shares the survey results with employees, and senior management incorporates the results of the surveys in their action plans in order to respond to the feedback and further enhance employee engagement. 
Safety
Employee safety is paramount in the work we perform. One of our company core beliefs is to "Live Safely," which to us means that we protect ourselves and others from injury by constant engagement, "always living safely." Our goal is to have zero safety incidents every year, and we educate all of our employees on our incident and injury free workplace vision. We report and analyze all near misses and incidents to understand the causal factors and associated corrective actions necessary to reduce the likelihood of reoccurrence. We share what we have learned company-wide to provide real-time learning opportunities for all employees. We track our safety performance and benchmark ourselves to our peer utility group, the Southeast Electric Exchange. For 2021, our Southeast Electric Exchange OSHA incident rate of 0.28 was the best in the group and the best in company history. The incident rate is calculated by counting the number of injuries and illnesses per 100 employees' standard base labor hours divided by the number of actual hours employees worked. We consistently rank among the top of our 17-member peer group, ranking first in the Southeast Electric Exchange in two of the last four years. We continue to analyze trends and engage in discussions with our employees, creating a dialogue to enhance safety performance and work towards our incident and injury-free workplace. Our focus on safety has contributed to each of the last six years being the safest in our 120-year history. Further discussion of the steps we are taking to help ensure employee safety during the COVID-19 pandemic can be found in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis – Recent Developments – COVID-19." 
Diversity and Inclusion
Within our overall recruitment efforts, we are focused on diversity with the over-arching goal of the company's workforce looking like the members of the communities we serve. Several of the talent pipeline partnerships referenced above are with organizations and trade schools whose student populations are diverse or raised in underrepresented communities. The company continues working with others to recruit diverse students to their programs, which can lead to potential employment for our positions. We have also formed relationships with universities to provide scholarships to students with diverse backgrounds and have focused on hiring individuals transitioning out of the military. 
We strive to reinforce the belief that our employees are one of our greatest assets by creating a culture of respect throughout the company. One of our core beliefs is to "Value Diversity and Inclusion," which to us means that we embrace the uniqueness of each individual to make us a stronger and more resourceful organization, which enables us to serve and support the diverse communities where we live and work. We do this by, among other things, encouraging employees to treat others justly and considering their views in the decisions we make. We are also focused on the inclusion of diverse individuals in leadership positions. Representation of females and other diverse members among our officers, management-level directors and senior managers has been trending upward for the past 5 years, and we expect that trend to continue. The retirement of our more tenured employees creates opportunities to promote or attract and hire additional individuals with diverse backgrounds. 
The company currently has employee-led Member Resource Groups ("MRGs") supporting African Americans, Asian American & Pacific Islanders, Latin/Hispanic heritage, Public Service, Veterans and Women. Each MRG selects an officer of the company to serve as its Executive Sponsor. These MRGs are intended to foster a sense of belonging for all employees, inspire conversation, introduce new ways of thinking about issues, drive innovation among our diverse population of members and provide an opportunity for professional development, community involvement and recruitment. All groups are voluntary and inclusive.
