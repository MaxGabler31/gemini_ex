Item 1. BUSINESS.
Business Overview 



Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage, biopharmaceutical company applying its proprietary platform technology and deep understanding of radiobiology to the development of novel targeted radiotherapies for patients with unmet needs. Our targeted radiotherapies combine the cell-killing ability of radiation via a radioisotope payload with a targeting agent, such as a monoclonal antibody, to deliver radiation in a precise manner inside the body to specific, targeted cells, to potentially achieve greater efficacy with lower toxicity than with external beam radiation. They also enable a broader usage of radiation than external beam radiation as they can be used in the treatment of both solid tumors and blood cancers, which generally cannot be treated with external radiation given their diffuse nature. Our clinical pipeline is focused on targeting the antigens CD45 and CD33, both of which are expressed in multiple hematologic cancers, which are known to be highly sensitive to radiation. Our clinical programs are focused on two primary areas: (1) targeted conditioning prior to a bone marrow transplant (“BMT”), adoptive cell therapy (“ACT”) such as CAR-T or gene therapy with Iomab-B and (2) targeted radiotherapy combinations with Actimab-A and other therapeutic agents. Our product development strategy is actively informed by clinical data with Iomab-B and Actimab-A in approximately 600 patients, including our ongoing Pivotal Phase 3 SIERRA trial, which completed its targeted enrollment of 150 patients in the third quarter of 2021, with the last patient receiving their BMT in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our clinical pipeline has emanated from our Antibody Warhead Enabling (“AWE”) technology platform, which is protected by over 170 issued and pending patents, trade secrets and know-how that we are applying to the development of targeted radiotherapies for blood and solid tumor indications, independently and with collaborators. Ongoing collaborations include a research partnership with Astellas Pharma, Inc. (“Astellas”) focused on the development of theranostics, which enable the diagnosis and treatment, for solid tumor indications, a collaboration with EpicentRx, Inc, focused on a novel CD47 immunotherapy targeted radiotherapy combination, leveraging EpicentRx’s RRx-01, that is being studied in a Phase 3 trial in non-small cell lung cancer, with our clinical stage Actimab-A in AML models, and a collaboration with AVEO Oncology, focused on developing a HER3 targeting ARC or Antibody Radiation Conjugate for solid tumors leveraging with their clinical stage antibody. We are also utilizing our AWE technology platform to advance our research objectives focused on developing next-generation targeted radiotherapies with our expanded research and development organization and research laboratories leveraging our drug development experience.
Targeted Conditioning



To the best of our knowledge, we are advancing the only multi-target, multi-indication, clinical-stage pipeline for targeted conditioning. Our targeted conditioning agents are intended to potentially enable improved access and outcomes to cell-based therapies with curative potential, including BMT, ACT, and gene therapy Conditioning in the context of BMT, ACT or gene therapy is the act of depleting certain blood and immune-forming cells, including bone marrow stem cells and, in some cases, cancer cells prior to transplanting new cells into a patient. Currently, conditioning is accomplished using a combination of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents and external radiation. These non-targeted conditioning regimens are highly toxic and may prevent a patient from receiving a potentially curative therapy and hinder outcomes. We believe our targeted conditioning agents have the potential to increase patient access and outcomes by way of their ability to selectively deplete targeted cells while sparing normal healthy cells, resulting in potentially lower systemic and off-target toxicities. We use our ARCs both at high isotope dose levels to achieve myeloablation, which fully depletes bone marrow stem cells and at lower isotope dose levels to achieve lymphodepletion, which spares bone marrow stem cells from depletion. In addition, dosing may be titrated downward from myeloablative doses to achieve partial myeloablation, which may be appropriate for certain gene therapy programs.

CD45 Targeted Conditioning Program



Iomab-B (I-131 apamistamab), our lead candidate and targeted conditioning agent is comprised of the anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody known as apamistamab (formerly BC8) and the radioisotope Iodine-131 (“I-131”). CD45 is an antigen expressed on leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma cancer cells, as well as nucleated immune cells including bone marrow stem cells, but is not expressed outside of the hematopoietic, or blood forming, system. This unique expression on blood cancer and immune cells enables simultaneous depletion of both cell types, making CD45 an optimal antigen for targeted conditioning applications. CD45 is a cell surface antigen with an average expression of 200,000 copies per cell, however, it only internalizes at a rate of 10-15%. We believe our ARC approach is the most effective method to target CD45 positive cells, as the radioisotope payload linear energy transfer can readily ablate a targeted cell without requiring payload internalization like an antibody drug conjugate or without relying on biological effector function processes like a naked antibody. Furthermore, since CD45 expression level varies from low to high antigen density as the immune cells become more terminally differentiated, we can selectively condition depending on the therapeutic application, from full myeloablation to transient lymphodepletion, by adjusting the dose or intensity of the I-131 isotope payload. Full myeloablation can be achieved with high doses of I-131, as its energy pathlength and crossfire effect can penetrate into bone marrow niches to target and deplete blood and immune system forming bone marrow stem cells. Myeloablation is applicable to autologous or allogeneic BMT and to autologous gene-edited or modified therapies that can reconstitute a patient’s blood and immune systems. Alternatively, low doses of I-131 can be transiently lymphodepleting and spare a patient’s bone marrow stem cells, which we believe is ideal for ACT applications such as CAR-T. We intend to develop our CD45 targeted conditioning program for BMT, ACT and gene therapy applications for malignant and non-malignant diseases and believe that multiple radioisotopes beyond I-131 may be utilized including alpha and beta emitters.



Iomab-B uses high doses of I-131 to achieve myeloablative conditioning prior to a BMT, is currently being studied in the pivotal Phase 3 Study of Iomab-B in Elderly Relapsed or Refractory AML (“SIERRA”), clinical trial for targeted conditioning prior to an allogeneic BMT for patients with active, relapsed or refractory (“r/r”) Acute Myeloid Leukemia, (“AML”), who are age 55 or older. Enrollment of the planned 150 patients in the SIERRA trial was completed in the third quarter of 2021 with the last patient receiving their BMT in the fourth quarter of 2021. Patients with active, r/r AML are not normally considered eligible for BMT and the SIERRA trial is the only randomized Phase 3 trial to offer BMT as a treatment option for this patient population. The SIERRA trial compares outcomes of patients randomized to receive Iomab-B and a BMT (the “study arm”) to those patients randomized to receive physician’s choice of salvage therapy (the “control arm”). The control arm is also defined as conventional care, as no standard of care exists for this patient population and includes over 20 agents that may be used as single agents or in combination including venetoclax, a targeted Bcl-2 inhibitor, Midostaurin and Sorafenib, targeted FLT3 inhibitors, hypomethylating agents and cytotoxic chemotherapies. Patients who fail to achieve a Complete Remission (“CR”) on the control arm are ineligible to proceed to a BMT, but the trial design permits these patients to “cross over” to receive the study arm treatment if they meet the eligibility criteria. The primary endpoint of the SIERRA trial is durable Complete Remission (“dCR”) of 180 days and the secondary endpoint is Overall Survival (“OS”). When the crossover patients receive Iomab-B and BMT, they have not achieved remission with their salvage therapy and are considered to be failures for the primary endpoint of the study. The SIERRA trial recruited patients at 24 sites in the United States and Canada, which includes many of the leading BMT sites based on volume. If approved, we expect our initial commercial launch would target the leading 50-100 BMT and medical centers that perform the vast majority of BMT’s in the United States. In the European Union (“EU”), we received favorable feedback from the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) via their scientific advice program that the trial design, primary endpoint and planned statistical analysis from the SIERRA trial are acceptable as the basis for a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA. Additionally, the EMA commented that it does not anticipate the need for further standalone preclinical toxicology or safety studies. Overall, transplant procedures in the EU are approximately fifty percent higher than in the United States with a similar market dynamic, with a majority of BMT volume being conducted in a concentrated number of leading medical centers. Currently we intend to secure a partner for Iomab-B in the EU.

Data from full patient enrollment in the SIERRA trial (151 patients), was presented at the American Society of Hematology (“ASH”) Annual Meeting in December 2021. The data presented includes rates of BMT access and engraftment, 100-day non-relapse transplant-related mortality (100-day TRM) and adverse events, which has been reported from interim analyses conducted at 25%, 50% 75% and 100% of patient enrollment pursuant to the study protocol. The data presented at ASH highlighted that 100% of patients (59/59) on the study arm that received a therapeutic dose of Iomab-B received a BMT, with a median time to BMT of 30 days, and all patients achieved neutrophil and platelet engraftment in a median time of 18 days despite a high median blast count of 29%. On the control arm, only 17% of patients (13/76) achieved remission after salvage therapy, and then received a BMT with a median time to BMT of 67 days and median blast count of 20%. Of the 83% of patients failing to achieve a CR with conventional care (47/57), 30 patients were eligible to cross over to receive Iomab-B followed by transplant. These patients are considered as having failed the primary endpoint of the study. All crossover patients who received the therapeutic dose of Iomab-B (30/30) received a BMT, with a median time to BMT of 24 days and they achieved engraftment in a median time of 19 days despite high median blast count of 22% at time of crossover. It was also reported that 100-day TRM of the study or Iomab-B arm was 10% (6/59) of patients that received a BMT compared to 15% of patients (2/13) who received a BMT after salvage therapy on the control arm. The universal engraftment rate and low 100-day TRM rate of the Iomab-B arm resulted in 53 patients potentially evaluable for the primary endpoint compared to 11 patients in the control arm, an approximate five times difference. At each of the interim analyses throughout the SIERRA trial, this approximate five times difference has been consistent in favor of the Iomab-B arm as a result of higher rates of BMT engraftment and lower rates of 100-day TRM.



Data from the SIERRA trial has also been accepted for presentation at the upcoming Transplantation & Cellular Therapy (“TCT”) Tandem Meetings of the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (“ASTCT”) and Center for International Bone & Marrow Transplant Research (“CIBMTR”), which has been postponed from February to April 2022. At TCT, we expect to present additional data from the SIERRA trial to include patients who have matured for BMT engraftment and 100-day TRM analysis, for which data was not available at time of the submission cutoff for ASH in December of 2021. Top-line data for the primary endpoint of durable Complete Remission is expected to be presented in the third quarter of 2022. We believe topline data from SIERRA will support the submission of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), which we expect to file in the first half of 2023.



Our Iomab-ACT program is intended for targeted conditioning prior to ACT or gene therapy and uses the same I-131-apamistamab construct as Iomab-B at varying doses. At lower doses of one-eighth to one-sixth of the myeloablative dose, it is applicable for lymphodepletion prior to CAR-T or certain gene therapy applications where stem cell myeloablation is not necessary. At higher doses it is applicable for gene therapy applications where stem cell myeloablation is necessary.



We believe our Iomab-ACT program is highly differentiated when compared to Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide (“Flu/Cy”) or other chemotherapy-based regimens that are used as the standard of practice today for lymphodepletion prior to CAR-T. CD45 is an antigen expressed on certain immune cell types that are relevant to the mechanism of CAR-T therapies including lymphocytes, regulatory T-cells and macrophages that have been associated with clinical responses that may limit the safety, efficacy and durability of response of these CAR-T therapies including cytokine release syndrome (“CRS”) and neurotoxicity. Some of these limitations may be attributable to the chemotherapy-based conditioning agents that are being used prior to CAR-T therapies. Preclinical data supporting the rational for our Iomab-ACT program was presented at multiple medical conferences in 2019. Unlike chemotherapy, Iomab-ACT is targeted in nature and, due to this CD45-directed targeting, we expect we can improve CAR-T cell expansion, potentially resulting in responses that are more durable, but also resulting in reduced CAR-T related toxicities. Importantly, we expect the Iomab-ACT program construct to enable lymphodepletion through a single-dose, outpatient administration versus Flu/Cy or other chemotherapy-based lymphodepletion regimens that can require multiple infusion cycles over several days. Because of this potentially superior profile, the Iomab-ACT construct could result in improved access to CAR-T therapy and better outcomes.

We are studying Iomab-ACT in a clinical collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (“MSKCC”) for targeted conditioning prior to administration of MSKCC’s 19-28z CD19 targeting CAR-T in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”) or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”). We received grant funding from the National Institute of Health (“NIH”) to fund this trial with MSKCC being a co-recipient on this grant. This is a first of its kind study to use an ARC-based conditioning regimen with CAR-T therapy. The hypothesized rationale for this study is that Iomab-ACT will exert an anti-tumor effect on the chemotherapy-refractory B-ALL cells that are sensitive to radiation resulting in reduced disease burden and simultaneously deplete CD45 expressing immune cells implicated in CAR-T related toxicities, resulting in an optimal homeostatic environment for the CAR-T cells. Results with MSKCC’s 19-28z CD-19 CAR-T in 53 patients with r/r B-ALL published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported complete remissions in 83% (44/53) of patients, which compares favorably to standard chemotherapy regimens that have complete remission rates of 18% - 45% in this patient population. Median event-free survival (EFS) was 6.1 months and median overall survival (OS) was 12.9 months at a median follow up period of 29 months (range 1 – 65 months). There was a 26% (14/53) rate of Grade 3 or greater CRS and a 42% rate of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity reported. The study will evaluate the feasibility of using an ARC-based conditioning regimen with CAR-T therapy and will evaluate safety measures including incidence of CRS and neurotoxicity and efficacy measures including responses and survival outcomes. In March 2021, we announced that patient enrollment was initiated, and the first patient was administered Iomab-ACT followed by their 19-28z CAR-T therapy. We expect proof of concept data from this study in the second half of 2022.



In addition, we are working in collaboration with the University of California Davis to utilize Iomab-ACT conditioning with a novel anti-HIV autologous gene therapy. We continue to identify additional gene therapies for which Iomab-ACT can be used for targeted conditioning with the goal of collaborating with multiple academic or industry developers to establish Iomab-ACT as a non-chemotherapy universal targeted conditioning solution.



CD33 Program: Combinations and Therapeutics

 

Our CD33 program is evaluating the clinical utility of Actimab-A, comprised of the anti-CD33 mAb lintuzumab linked to the potent alpha-emitting radioisotope Actinium-225 (“Ac-225”). CD33 is expressed in the majority of patients with AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (“MDS”) as well as approximately one-third of patients with multiple myeloma. Ac-225 emits four alpha particles and can kill a cell with one alpha-particle hit, making it one of the most powerful cell-killing agents with no know resistance mechanism to the double strand DNA breaks it can cause. We source Ac-225 from the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory.



Our CD33 development program is driven by data obtained from nearly one hundred fifty treated patients, including results from a Phase 1/2 trial that studied Actimab-A as a single agent at multiple dose levels in 58 patients with newly diagnosed AML, which was completed in 2018, as well as trials studying Actimab-A in combination with other agents.



We believe that radiation delivered internally via a targeting moiety can be synergistic when used in combination with chemotherapy, targeted agents and immunotherapy based on mechanistic rationales supported by our own clinical data, preclinical research and scientific and clinical evidence in the literature. We have prioritized our efforts and resources in favor of combination trials for our CD33 program development strategy rather than single agent trials at this time as we believe Actimab-A can be a backbone therapy in AML when combined with other therapeutic modalities. Our CD33 development program encompasses the following ongoing trials:

Actimab -A Combination Trials:



Actimab-A + CLAG-M 



The combination of Actimab-A with CLAG-M has been studied in a Phase 1 combination trial that was conducted in collaboration with the Medical College of Wisconsin (“MCW”) in patients age 18 and above with r/r AML who are fit for intensive therapy. Patient enrollment was completed in November 2021. CLAG-M (cladribine, cytarabine, filgrastim and mitoxantrone) is a salvage chemotherapy regimen that produced a 55% remission rate in patients with r/r AML in a previous study conducted by MCW that compared outcomes of patients receiving either CLAG-M, MEC or CLAG salvage therapy regimens. Data from the Phase 1 combination trial of Actimab-A + CLAG-M were presented at ASH in December 2021. After completion of dose-escalation in the Phase 1 trial, the recommended Phase 2 dose was determined to be 0.75 µCi/kg of Actimab-A. 3 patients were enrolled in the 0.75 µCi/kg dose cohort, which had a 100% remission rate comprised of 1 complete remission (“CR”) and 2 complete remissions with incomplete platelet recovery (“CRp”), there were no dose limiting toxicities (“DLTs”) or 30-day mortality reported. Overall, a 67% (12/18) overall response rate (“ORR”) was reported across all dose cohorts (0.25 – 1.0 µCi/kg) and remissions were achieved in every dose cohort including the 0.25 and 0.50 µCi/kg doses of Actimab-A, which have been shown to be subtherapeutic as a single agent. In addition, there was a 72% minimal residual disease (“MRD”) negativity rate, which compares favorably to the 39% MRD negativity rate reported by MCW with CLAG-M alone. This study enrolled patients who previously failed Venetoclax, a targeted Bcl-2 inhibitor, and efficacy was similar in patients Venetoclax naïve and those that previously failed Venetoclax, with a 60% response rate in previous Venetoclax failures. We are working to develop a regulatory and development pathway for the Actimab-A CLAG-M combination and will be evaluating potential registration enabling strategies. In addition, we believe this Actimab-A + CLAG-M combination study has provided proof of principle that the addition of Actimab-A to other AML therapies can lead to well-tolerated regimens with improved responses, which supports our Actimab-A backbone therapy in AML strategy.



Actimab-A + Venetoclax



We are also conducting a Phase 1/2 Actimab-A combination trial with the Bcl-2 inhibitor Venetoclax in fit and unfit patients age 18 and above with relapsed or refractory AML. This multi-center trial is being led by UCLA Medical Center. This combination is supported by mechanistic evidence in preclinical studies using Venetoclax -resistant AML tumor cell lines. In these models, we have demonstrated that Actimab-A can deplete Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL, two proteins implicated in mediating resistance to Venetoclax, in addition to causing potentially lethal double-stranded DNA breaks in these CD33 expressing cells. Furthermore, in vivo studies in animal models of Venetoclax-resistant AML demonstrated robust tumor regression and improved survival in cohorts receiving the Actimab-A Venetoclax combination compared to Venetoclax alone. The rationale for this clinical study is that the addition of Actimab-A will; 1) have a direct anti-tumor effect via double-stranded DNA breaks and 2) deplete Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL making the AML cells more susceptible to Venetoclax. Updated data from the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of this study was presented at ASH in December 2021 from three dose cohorts of 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0 µCi/kg of Actimab-A in a total of 12 patients. 50% of patients received Venetoclax therapy prior to enrollment on the Actimab-A combination trial. And 67% of patients had poor risk cytogenetics, of which, 3 had a TP53 mutation, which is associate with poorer response rates and survival outcomes. Of the patients with a TP53 mutation, 67% achieved a remission including a patient that achieved a CR and at the time of data cutoff for ASH, the patient was in follow-up 230 days (~7.5 months). The combination of Actimab-A with Venetoclax was reported to be well-tolerated with no 30-day mortality. The data to date support advancing to the Phase 2 portion of the trial and we expect to provide an update on the development strategy, including consideration of patients with a TP53 mutation, after the Phase 1 dose finding portion of the trial is complete and the recommended Phase 2 dose is determined.



In addition to these ongoing trials, we actively seek and evaluate additional modalities and agents that can be the basis for Actimab-A therapeutic combinations such as the CD47 immunotherapy magrolimab combinations we announced at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer in November 2021 to leverage our clinical experience, supply chain and AWE technology platform.

CD47 Based ARC Combinations in Solid Tumors and Blood Cancers



CD47 is a macrophage checkpoint that is upregulated in multiple cancers including blood cancers such as AML and MDS as well as solid tumors. CD47 acts as a “don’t eat me” signal on cancer cells to suppress phagocytosis and evade detection and destruction by the immune system. It has become an immunotherapy target of significant interest with multiple biopharmaceutical companies actively developing CD47 targeting agents across a wide range of oncology and hematology indications. CD47 targeting agents have shown limited efficacy as single agent monotherapies in AML/MDS or solid tumors, which has led to combinations such as with hypomethylating agents in AML/MDS. We hypothesized that targeted radiotherapy via ARCs could synergize with CD47 targeting agents via the direct cytotoxic and immunogenic effect of ARCs without overlapping toxicities. To explore this synergy and the potential to improve patient outcomes and we have initiated a program in AML with our Actimab-A ARC, consistent with our strategy to establish Actimab-A a backbone AML therapy, and in solid tumors with a HER-2 targeting ARC, which emanated from our AWE technology platform. To our knowledge, these are the first and only ARC-based targeted radiotherapy combinations with CD47 immunotherapy. Data from these novel combinations were presented at the 36th Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy for Cancer.



The most advanced CD47 development programs are being studied in patients with AML and MDS. Leveraging our clinical experience with Actimab-A in these indications we have begun studying Actimab-A with the anti-CD47 antibody immunotherapy magrolimab, which is owned by Gilead Sciences, Inc., in preclinical models of AML. In preclinical models, it was shown that in multiple AML cell lines, the combination of Actimab-A with magrolimab led to increased phagocytosis of AML cells compared to magrolimab alone. Our studies also demonstrated that AML cell lines exposed to Actimab-A had an upregulation of calreticulin, which is a pro-phagocytic or “eat me” signal, which we hypothesize makes Actimab-A potentially synergistic with magrolimab and other anti-CD47 antibodies. The Actimab-A and magrolimab combination showed a significant increase in survival compared to Actimab-A alone in a disseminated AML animal tumor model. We intend to continue to study preclinically this combination with the goal of advancing to human clinical trials.



In January 2022, we announced a research collaboration with EpicentRx that will evaluate Actimab-A in combination with EpicentRx’s RRx-001in AML. EpicentRx’s RRx-001, currently under investigation in a Phase 3 trial for Small Cell Lung Cancer and in other oncology and non-oncology indications, is a versatile next generation small molecule immunotherapeutic that targets the CD47-SIRPα axis and the NLRP3 inflammasome to alter the tumor microenvironment and optimize immune response. This collaboration will explore the mechanistic synergy of RRx-001’s CD47–SIRPα downregulation with Actinium’s targeted radiotherapy calreticulin upregulation to increase the immune detection and destruction of cancer cells. Preclinical experiments have begun exploring this combination in AML models. We intend to leverage our experience with CD47 targeting agents such as magrolimab in this collaboration. Based on Actimab-A and RRx-001 both being clinical-stage assets, we believe there is a potentially faster pathway to clinical trials with this novel combination, particularly if the preclinical safety and efficacy profile are in line with what was observed with Actimab-A and magrolimab.

Antibody Warhead Enabling Technology Platform



Our proprietary AWE technology platform is supported by intellectual property, know-how and trade secrets that cover the generation, development, methods of use and manufacture of targeted radiotherapies and certain of their components. Our AWE technology patent portfolio presently includes 39 patent families comprised of 173 issued patents and pending patent applications, of which 8 are issued and 30 are pending in the United States, and 135 are issued or pending internationally. The effective lives of the issued patents in our portfolio, or patents that may issue from the pending applications in our portfolio, ranges from expirations between 2024 and 2042. Our technology enables the direct labeling, or conjugation and labeling, of a biomolecular targeting agent to a radionuclide warhead and its development and use as a therapeutic regimen for the treatment of diseases such as cancer. Our AWE intellectual property covers various methods of use in multiple diseases, including indication, dose and scheduling, radionuclide warhead, and therapeutic combinations. We have particular expertise in utilizing the alpha emitting isotope Ac-225 including clinical experience in treating approximately 150 patients with our alpha-emitter-based therapies, “gold standard” linker technology and 5 issued patents in the United States and 49 patents internationally related to the manufacturing or Ac-225 in a cyclotron, which we believe has the potential to produce higher quantities of Ac-225 than currently utilized methods.



In 2021 we have enhanced our research and development capabilities around AWE by securing and staffing research facilities. Our research laboratories are focused on applying our AWE technology platform to the development of radiation conjugates and to execute on research collaborations. Our R&D efforts employ a multidisciplinary approach leveraging our team’s knowledge and experience in cancer cell biology, radiochemistry, radiation sciences, immunology and oncology drug development. We intend to focus on generating targeted radiotherapies using our existing intellectual property, evaluating assets for in-licensing to complement our existing clinical pipeline and securing collaborations and partnerships with biopharmaceutical companies. By adding research and development capabilities to our clinical development and clinical supply chain capabilities, we seek to enable the rapid translation of radiotherapies.



Our AWE technology platform is being utilized in our ongoing research collaboration with Astellas to arm select targeting agents owned by Astellas with the alpha-emitting radioisotope Ac-225 for the development of theranostics for solid tumor indications, which combine the ability of radioisotopes to be used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.



We also utilized AWE to create aHER2-targeting radiotherapy using the antibody Trastuzumab with either Ac-225 or Lu-177 radioisotopes to study in combination with magrolimab for solid tumors. Anti-CD47 monotherapies, such as magrolimab, have not shown meaningful responses in clinical studies in solid tumors. We hypothesized that radiation directed at HER2 expressing cells would upregulate cell surface calreticulin, a pro-phagocytic “eat me” signal, that when combined with an anti-CD47 blockade therapy would enhance antitumor activity. Data from this combination was presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy for Cancer in November 2021. In vitro studies showed that immunogenicity, determined by binding to HER2 expressing cells, remained intact after radiolabeling Trastuzumab with Ac-225 or Lu-177. In multiple cells lines radiolabeled Trastuzumab increased cell surface calreticulin and the combination with magrolimab increased phagocytosis. The combination of the Ac-225 or Lu-117 Trastuzumab with magrolimab slowed tumor growth in animal models of solid tumors compared to either the radiolabeled Trastuzumab or magrolimab as single agents. We are continuing to evaluate this combination in additional tumor models, and we intend to continue to study this combination with the goal of advancing to human clinical trials.



We are also collaborating with AVEO Oncology (“AVEO”) to develop a targeted radiotherapy against ErbB3, also known as HER3, with the Ac-225 isotope for solid tumor indications. HER3 is overexpressed in several solid tumor indications with high unmet needs, including colorectal, gastric, head and neck, breast, ovarian, melanoma, prostate and bladder cancers with HER3 agents under development demonstrating activity in preclinical and clinical studies. To our knowledge, this is the first HER3 targeting radiotherapy in development. AVEO is developing high affinity antibodies including HER3 targeting AV-203, which has demonstrated preclinical activity across a number of solid tumor indications and was studied in a Phase 1 open-label trial in patients with advanced solid tumors where it was found to be safe and generally well tolerated. In March 2022, we announced that data from studies of Ac-225 radiolabeled HER3 antibody have been accepted for presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) Annual Meeting. Preliminary results contained in the AACR abstract showed potent tumor cell cytotoxicity, complete anti-tumor response in a HER3 tumor xenograft models and significantly prolonged survival compared to control groups (p<0.0001). Additional data from these studies will be presented at AACR in April 2022. We believe these preliminary results support our collaboration with AVEO and given that AV-203 has clinical safety data, a potentially accelerated regulatory pathway to clinical studies with an Ac-225 HER3 targeted radiotherapy.

Regulatory Protections




The indications for which we are developing our product candidates for are orphan drug designations, which are disease indications that affect fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States and less than 5 in 10,000 patients in the EU. We have received orphan drug designation for Iomab-B and Actimab-A for patients with AML in both the United States and the EU. As a result, if our products are to be approved, they may receive 7 years and 10 years of market exclusivity in the United States and EU, respectively. In addition, our product candidates are biologics combined with radioisotopes. We believe that the nature of radioisotopes having half-lives combined with the complexities of biologic drugs would make it difficult for a manufacturer to demonstrate bioequivalence to our product candidates. The Hatch-Waxman Act requires that a manufacturer of generic drugs, for which a biologic drug is called a biosimilar, demonstrate bioequivalence to the innovator. However, we are not aware of any existing or pending regulations or legislation that pertains to generic radiopharmaceutical products such as our antibody radiation-conjugate product candidates
Competition 



The biopharmaceutical industry in which we operate, specifically, the field of oncology drug development is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Radiopharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer has received considerable interest from major and specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and other public and private entities, particularly in recent years.



For the targeted radiotherapies we are developing, we face competition from biopharmaceuticals companies who are developing alpha particle-based therapies utilizing Actinium-225, Radium-223 and Thorium-227. Companies developing targeted alpha therapies include Bayer AG, who owns Xofigo, the only approved alpha therapy, that is used in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, Novartis AG, Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited, Point Biopharma, Inc., Fusion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., RayzeBio, Inc., Aktis Oncology, Curie Therapeutics, RadioMedix, Inc. and Orano Med. Significant attention and resources is being applied to Ac-225 based therapies given its high linear energy and short path length. Fusion Pharmaceuticals is studying FPI-1434, targeting IFG-1R with Ac-225 in a Phase 1 trial in solid tumors and has recently initiated a Phase 1 study to test FGFR3 targeting agent in development. Point Biopharma is studying PNT2002, a PSMA targeting agent for metastatic prostate cancer in a Phase 1 trial, PNT2004, a preclinical agent targeting solid tumors expressing FAP, and PNT2001, a preclinical agent also targeting PSMA in prostate cancer, which all utilize Ac-225. Novartis is also developing a PSMA targeting agent utilizing Ac-225 for prostate cancer. RayzeBio, Aktis Oncology and Curie Therapeutics are all pursuing Ac-225 based therapies but have not yet disclosed cancer targets or indications.



To our knowledge, our Actimab-A product candidate is the only clinical stage Ac-225 based therapy in active development for hematologic indications.



There are also several companies developing beta particle-based therapies such as Bayer, Novartis, Lantheus Holdings, Inc. and Q BioMed, Inc., who all own approved products. Beta particles used for oncology therapeutics includes Iodine-131, Lutetium-177, Strontium-89 and Yttrium-90. Companies developing beta particle-based therapies includes Cellectar Biosciences, Inc., Clovis Oncology, Inc., Y-mAbs Therapeutics, Inc., Ipsen S.A., and Novartis.



In the field of conditioning, pharmaceuticals currently used for myeloablation prior to a bone marrow transplant, lymphodepletion prior to CAR-T and other adoptive cell therapies and conditioning for gene therapy are largely generic, non-targeted chemotherapeutic agents like fludarabine or busulfan and/or total body irradiation.



In targeted conditioning, we face competition from companies developing agents targeting CD117 (Jasper Therapeutics and Magenta Therapeutics), CD45 (Magenta Therapeutics) and CD66 (Telix Pharmaceuticals). CD117 is expressed in normal CNS, GI, reproductive, kidney and skin tissue, which could result in on-target toxicity to these organs. CD117 is not expressed on mature circulating immune cells and thus cannot be targeted for lymphodepletion for adoptive cell therapy. Jasper Therapeutics, Inc, is developing JSP191, an anti-CD117 unconjugated monoclonal antibody that is being studied in a Phase 1b trial in combination with fludarabine and total body irradiation in patients with MDS and AML. Magenta has initiated a Phase 1/2 trial for its MGTA-117 CD117 ADC and will conduct this first in human dose finding study in patients with r/r AML MDS with excess blasts and is exploring MGTA-117 for gene therapy conditioning in preclinical studies. Magenta is also developing its CD45 ADC, which is has not yet been studied in humans and is being evaluated in IND enabling studies.



Forty Seven, Inc.(acquired by Gilead) announced a conditioning regimen comprised of its anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody Magrolimab with its preclinical stage FSI-174 anti-CD117 monoclonal antibody in a preclinical collaboration with bluebird bio, Inc. for conditioning prior to gene therapy.



Molecular Templates announced a collaboration with Vertex focused on targeted conditioning using its Engineered Toxin Bodies (ETBs) with two targets that were not disclosed. In October 2021, Vertex terminated the research collaboration with Molecular Templates. Molecular Templates has a preclinical stage CD45 ETB in development.



Telix Pharmaceuticals is developing TLX66, a CD66 targeting antibody radio conjugated with Yttrium-90, for BMT conditioning in patients with Systemic Amyloid Light-Chain Amyloidosis (SALA). TLX66 is also being studied in a Phase 2 investigator sponsored trial in the U.K in patients with childhood leukemia.



Allogene Therapeutics is developing an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody for use as a lymphodepletion agent in conjunction with CAR-T therapies. CD52 is not expressed on stem cells and therefore cannot be used for myeloablation for a bone marrow transplant.



To our knowledge, we are the only company with an anti-CD45 radio conjugate in clinical development and the only company with a targeted conditioning agent that has completed enrollment of a pivotal Phase 3 trial.

Our Actimab-A product candidate faces competition from several major pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies who are also developing multiple types of therapies including chemotherapy, targeted agents, ADCs, monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, immunotherapies and cellular therapies for patients with AML. The standard of care for patients with AML has long been “7+3”, which is 7 days of treatment with cytarabine with an anthracycline on the first 3 days for patients who can tolerate intensive therapy and hypomethylating agents, azacitidine or decitabine, for patients who are “unfit” and cannot tolerate intensive therapy. Since 2017, 9 agents have been approved for patients with AML. These approved agents include Vyxeos (liposomal cytarabine and daunorubicin) owned by Jazz Pharmaceuticals, venetoclax, a Bcl-2 inhibitor owned by Abbvie, FLT3 inhibitors midostaurin (owned by Novartis) and gilteritinib (owned by Astellas), Daurismo, a hedgehog pathway inhibitor owned by Pfizer, IDH inhibitors Tibsovo (IDH1) and Idhifa (IDH2) owned by Servier, Onureg (oral azacitidine) owned by Bristol Myers Squibb and Mylotarg, a CD33 targeting ADC owned by Pfizer.



These agents are approved in various AML patient segments including secondary or treatment related AML (Vyxeos), patients over the age of 75 or patients unfit for intensive therapy (venetoclax and Daurismo) and patients with a specific cytogenetic mutation such as FLT3 or IDH1/2. Despite these 9 approved agents, outcomes for patients with r/r AML remain dismal and it remains an area of high medical need that could accommodate many new products with favorable safety and efficiency profiles.



We are pursuing CD33 because it is expressed in virtually all patients with AML. AML is known to be highly sensitive to radiation, which lends itself to our targeted radiotherapy approach. Also, AML has high cytogenetic and mutational heterogeneity, which targeted radiotherapy is agnostic to. Combination therapies are commonly used in hematologic indications, but we believe we are the only clinical stage Ac-225 based product candidate that is being explored in hematologic indications in combination with other modalities, including with the salvage chemotherapy regimen CLAG-M in fit patients with relapsed or refractory AML as well as in combination with the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax in fit and unfit patients with relapsed or refractory AML.



In addition to developing targeted radiotherapies, we also own patents related to the manufacturing of Ac-225 in a cyclotron. Medical grade Ac-225 is largely supplied by the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) derived from the natural decay of thorium-229 from so-called “thorium-cows”. Additional routes of Ac-225 production are being pursued by the DOE including the generation of new thorium cows and production via a cyclotron to increase supply. The DOE’s cyclotron production method for Ac-225 production leverages Actinium’s proprietary technology and know-how and presents an additional path towards production of high-quality Ac-225. Previously, we utilized our cyclotron production IP to create highly pure Ac-225. We are aware of at least six other government and non-government entities globally that have or expect to have ability to supply Ac-225 using various methods including ITM, Niowave, Terrapower, NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes, IONETIX Corporation, TRIUMF and Canadian Nuclear Laboratories that could be competitors should we elect to manufacture Ac-225 in the future. We believe our cyclotron method has the potential to produce robust amounts of highly pure Ac-225, which could address potential future Ac-225 supply constraints should multiple Ac-225 products gain regulatory approval.



Government Regulation



Governmental authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing of radioimmunotherapy pharmaceutical products such as those being developed by us. In the United States, the FDA regulates such products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and implements regulations. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements, both before and after approval, may subject us to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation



Our research, development and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and other countries. Most notably, products that may in the future be sold in the United States are subject to regulation by the FDA. Certain of our product candidates in the United States will require FDA approval of a BLA prior to marketing. Foreign countries may require similar or more onerous approvals to manufacture or market these products.

FDA Approval Process for Biologics License Applications



Prior to testing a biological product on humans, the product must clear the preclinical testing stage. The goal of preclinical testing is to perform laboratory evaluations of the product’s chemistry and formulation as well as evaluate the product’s potential for adverse events by performing in vitro and animal studies. This information is packaged together and submitted to the FDA as part of an investigational new drug (“IND”) application, which must be approved by the FDA before administering the product to human subjects in clinical trials.



From there, the product moves to the clinical stage, where it is administered to healthy volunteers or patients. The data gathered from the preclinical testing and clinical trials is used to support the BLA submission. The FDA must approve the BLA prior to commercial marketing of a biological product. The BLA must include information about product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, manufacturing information, the composition of the product, and proposed labeling. The approval process requires significant time and financial resources and does not guarantee that FDA will accept the BLA filing or ultimately approve the BLA.



The Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended (“PDUFA”), requires each BLA to be accompanied by a substantial user fee. The amount of the user fee changes on an annual basis. In addition to the BLA user fee, PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for biological products. The FDA will waive or reduce the fee under limited circumstances, such as for first applications filed by small businesses.



Within 60 days following submission of the BLA, the FDA reviews the BLA submission for completion to determine if it will accept it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file the BLA if it deems the submission incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission. For the BLA review process to proceed, the BLA must be resubmitted with the necessary additional information. After the BLA is accepted for filing, the FDA commences its substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product’s manufacturing is consistent with current Good Manufacturing Processes (“cGMPs”) to ensure that the product meets the appropriate standards for identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity.



The FDA may involve an advisory committee for novel biological products that present complex questions of safety or efficacy. The advisory committee typically consists of a panel that includes clinicians and other subject matter experts that assist with the reviewing and evaluating the product. While the advisory committee provides a recommendation for whether the product should be approved and under what conditions, the FDA is not bound to follow the recommendations. However, the advisory committee’s recommendations are usually given significant consideration.



The FDA may also consider requiring a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) if it determines that one is necessary to ensure that the biological product is used safely. If the FDA requires a REMS, the BLA sponsor must develop and submit a proposed REMS for the BLA review process to move forward.



The manufacturer of the biological product is also subject to FDA inspection prior to the approval of the BLA. The purpose of the inspection is to determine whether the manufacturer adequately complies with the applicable cGMP requirements to ensure that the biological product is manufactured safely and within the required specifications. Additionally, the FDA may choose to inspect one or more clinical sites to assess compliance with IND trial requirements and good clinical practices (“GCPs”). Compliance with cGMP and GCP requirements involves significant expenditures of time, money, and effort for BLA sponsors due to associated training, recordkeeping, production, and quality control needs.



If the FDA decides not to approve the BLA in the form submitted, it will issue what is called a complete response letter that outlines the specific deficiencies it would like to see addressed. The deficiencies identified can be minor (e.g., labeling changes) or major (e.g., the need for additional clinical trials). The complete response letter may also include recommended actions the applicant may take to move closer towards securing an approval. At this point, applicants may choose to resubmit the BLA to address FDA’s concerns or withdraw the application.



In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.





10







Post-Approval Requirements



If the BLA is approved, the FDA may include additional conditions as part of its approval, such as limiting the approval by designating specific diseases for which the product may be used. Additionally, conditions may include requiring the labeling to include specific contraindications, warnings, or precautions, requiring post marketing clinical trials (sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials), and implementation of surveillance program to monitor the approved product once commercialized.



Products approved by the FDA under a BLA are subject to ongoing regulatory requirements, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, adverse event reporting requirements, responsibility for reporting updated safety and efficacy information to FDA, sampling and distribution requirements, complying with advertising and promotion requirements, and complying with cGMPs.



Quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to comply with cGMP requirements even after the BLA is approved. The cGMP regulations include, but are not limited to, requirements to ensure quality control, maintain appropriate manufacturing records and documentation, and the obligation to investigate and address deviations from cGMPs, when identified. Manufacturers are also required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. The establishments are also subject to unannounced inspections by regulators.



The advertising and promotion of drug and biologic products are also subject to specific laws and regulations. These authorities provide standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or to patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses, known as “off-label” use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet.



Regulatory Enforcement



Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or other regulatory authorities, which may result in sanctions, including but not limited to, untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products; operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing or delaying our requests for BLA premarket approval of new products or modified products; withdrawing BLA approvals that have already been granted; and refusal to grant export.
Additional Healthcare Laws



In addition to FDA regulations, several other types of state and federal laws may restrict our business activities, including certain healthcare laws. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.



The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item, good, facility or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and arrangements must meet every element to qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on the facts and circumstances involved. Courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare program business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the “Affordable Care Act,” to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.





11







Federal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Whistleblower or qui tam provisions under the False Claims Act permit whistleblowers to sue in the name of the federal government for False Claims Act violations, and to share in the recovery from any award. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws.



The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.



In addition, if we engage in certain activities, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation under HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH. HIPAA imposes certain requirements on covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates and covered subcontractors that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information.



Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and any ownership and investment interests held by physicians or their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year.



The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse laws, some of which are broader in scope and apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in some states, apply regardless of the payor. Many states also have some form of health information privacy or data security laws that could apply. Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and other healthcare providers and entities, marketing expenditures, or drug pricing. Certain state and local laws also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.



If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the healthcare regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to potentially significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, additional reporting obligations and oversight (if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws), exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, as well as contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.



Employees



As of March 25, 2022, we have 32 full-time employees including 20 with M.D., Ph.D. or other advanced degrees.



We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunity for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth, and an employment package that promotes wellness across all aspects of their lives, including healthcare, retirement planning, and paid time off. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. We also engage consultants on an as-needed basis to supplement existing staff.

Recent Developments



Impact of COVID–19 Pandemic 



The global health crisis caused by the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic and its resurgences has and may continue to negatively impact global economic activity, which, despite progress in vaccination efforts, remains uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. In addition, the Omicron variant of COVID-19, which appears to be the most transmissible variant to date, has spread globally. The full impact of the Omicron variant, or any subsequent variant, cannot be predicted at this time, and could depend on numerous factors, including vaccination rates among the population, the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the Omicron variant and the response by governmental bodies and regulators. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.



Many countries around the world have continued to impose quarantines and restrictions on travel and mass gatherings to slow the spread of the virus. Accordingly, our ability to continue to operate our business may also be limited. Such events may result in a period of business, supply and drug product manufacturing disruption, and in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In response to COVID-19, we implemented remote working and thus far have not experienced a significant disruption or delay in our operations as it relates to the clinical development of our drug candidates. Such government-imposed precautionary measures may have been relaxed in certain countries or states, but there is no assurance that more strict measures will be put in place again due to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, including those involving new variants of the coronavirus, which may be more contagious and deadly than prior strains. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to affect our operation, may further divert the attention and efforts of the medical community to coping with COVID-19 and disrupt the marketplace in which we operate and may have a material adverse effect on our operations.



A continuation or worsening of the levels of market disruption and volatility seen in the recent past could have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.



We believe our earlier stage CD33 clinical trials will continue to recruit and enroll patients given the acute nature of relapsed or refractory AML. The continuation of the pandemic could adversely affect our planned clinical trial operations, including our ability to conduct the trials on the expected timelines and recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19 if their geography is impacted by the pandemic. Further, the continuation and/or resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in delays in our clinical trials due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the pandemic, restrictions in travel, potential unwillingness of patients to enroll in trials at this time, or the inability of patients to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines or travel restrictions impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. In addition, we rely on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to assist us in managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and the pandemic may affect their ability to devote sufficient time and resources to our programs or to travel to sites to perform work for us, which may result in delays or hinder our ability to collect data from our clinical trials.



Additionally, COVID-19 may result in delays in receiving approvals from local and foreign regulatory authorities, delays in necessary interactions with IRB’s or Institutional Review Boards, local and foreign regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees.



To date, COVID-19 has not had a financial impact on our company. We continue to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy and on our business operations. Although we expect that vaccinations for COVID-19 will continue to improve conditions, the ultimate impact from COVID-19 on our business operations and financial results during 2022 will depend on, among other things, the ultimate severity and scope of the pandemic, including the new variants of the virus, the pace at which governmental and private travel restrictions and public concerns about public gatherings will ease, the rate at which historically large increases in unemployment rates will decrease, if at all, and whether, and the speed with which the economy recovers. We are not able to fully quantify the impact that these factors will have on our financial results during 2022 and beyond.
