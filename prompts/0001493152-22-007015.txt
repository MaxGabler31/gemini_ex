ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
------------+----------

Overview
 
Blink Charging Co., through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, is a leading owner, operator, and provider of electric vehicle (“EV”) charging equipment and networked EV charging services in the rapidly growing U.S. and international markets for EVs. Blink offers residential and commercial EV charging equipment and services, enabling EV drivers to recharge at various location types. Blink’s principal line of products and services includes its nationwide Blink EV charging network (the “Blink Network”) and Blink EV charging equipment, also known as electric vehicle supply equipment (“EVSE”), and other EV-related services. The Blink Network is a proprietary, cloud-based system that operates, maintains, and manages Blink charging stations and handles the associated charging data, back-end operations, and payment processing. The Blink Network provides property owners, managers, parking companies, and state and municipal entities (“Property Partners”), among other types of commercial customers, with cloud-based services that enable the remote monitoring and management of EV charging stations. The Blink Network also provides EV drivers with vital station information, including station location, availability, and fees (if applicable).
 
In order to capture more revenues derived from providing EV charging equipment to commercial customers and to help differentiate Blink in the EV infrastructure market, Blink offers Property Partners a comprehensive range of solutions for EV charging equipment and services that generally fall into one of the business models below, differentiated by who bears the costs of installation, equipment, maintenance, and the percentage of revenue shared.
 

● | In our Blink-owned turnkey business model, Blink incurs the costs of the charging equipment and installation. We own and operate the EV charging station and provide connectivity of the charging station to the Blink Network. In this model, which favors recurring revenues, Blink incurs most costs associated with the EV charging stations; thus, Blink retains substantially all EV charging revenues after deducting network connectivity and processing fees. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In our Blink-owned hybrid business model, Blink incurs the costs of the charging equipment while the Property Partner incurs the costs of installation. We own and operate the EV charging station and provide connectivity of the charging station to the Blink Network. In this model, the Property Partner incurs the installation costs associated with the EV station; thus, Blink shares a more generous portion of the EV charging revenues with the Property Partner after deducting network connectivity and processing fees. 
● | In our host-owned business model, the Property Partner purchases, owns and operates the Blink EV charging station and incurs the installation costs. Blink works with the Property Partner, providing site recommendations, connectivity to the Blink Network, payment processing, and optional maintenance services. In this model, the Property Partner retains and keeps all the EV charging revenues after deducting network connectivity and processing fees. 
● | In our Blink-as-a-Service model, Blink owns and operates the EV charging station, while the Property Partner incurs the installation costs. The Property Partner pays to Blink a fixed monthly fee and keeps all the EV charging revenues after deducting network connectivity and processing fees 

 
Blink also operates a ride-sharing program through the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, BlueLA Rideshare, LLC (“BlueLA”) and the City of Los Angeles which allows customers the ability to rent electric vehicles through a subscription service.
 
As part of Blink’s mission to facilitate the adoption of EVs through the deployment and operation of EV charging infrastructure globally, we are dedicated to slowing climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by road vehicles. With the goal of leading the build out of EV charging infrastructure and of maximizing Blink’s share of the EV charging market, we have established strategic commercial, municipal and retail partnerships across industry verticals and encompassing numerous transit/destination locations, including airports, auto dealers, healthcare/medical, hotels, mixed-use, municipal sites, multifamily residential and condos, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institutions, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations.
 
During 2021, Blink was awarded several new prominent customers including General Motors, Ford, Jaguar-Land Rover, Hyundai, Kia, Subaru, AutoNation, Berkshire-Hathaway Automotive, Bridgestone, the City of San Antonio, the Related Group, and others. During 2020, Blink awarded several new prominent customers, including Cushman & Wakefield, Reef Technology, Lehigh Valley Health, St. Luke’s University Health Network, Lion Electric, and several others that expand Blink’s potential for unit sales and deployments. Commensurate with these new business relationships, we also forged critical strategic relationships with organizations that directly or indirectly influence EV charging stations purchase decisions. Examples include Sustainable Westchester in New York and Clean Cities Organizations in Virginia, Vermont and Ohio.

The charger units reported herein are net of swap-out or replacement units.
 
Industry Overview
 
The market for plug-in electric vehicles experienced significant growth in recent years. In response to consumer demands, electric cars now feature extended ranges and improved performance. Notable events in 2020 further propelled the EV industry. Stay-at-home orders and the resulting reductions in global carbon dioxide emissions showcased the potential of cleaner, lower-emission air quality worldwide. Battery technology advances have allowed EVs to achieve approximate cost parity with internal combustion engine vehicles and have extended driving range and consumer confidence. Finally, the new United States administration’s focus on climate initiatives and its large-scale commitment to expanding EV charging infrastructure has spurred widespread interest and promotion of the EV industry.
 
Electric vehicle demand has also been spurred by federal, state, and local incentives and rebates for both vehicles and their required charging infrastructure. For example, California, Oregon, New York, Maryland, Massachusetts, and other states have created mandates for EVs to achieve more than 6.8 million EVs on the road by 2030. Further, a shift towards EV car-sharing has boosted the transition to EV fleets, leading to increased EV charging station demand. In response to consumer demand and governmental regulations, major automakers and OEMs have accelerated the development and production of a robust portfolio of electric vehicles. More than 70 EV models are currently available from automakers such as Tesla, Nissan, Kia, GM, Ford, Fiat, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Volkswagen, Toyota, Mitsubishi, Land Rover, and Porsche and an estimated 62 more are scheduled to become available in 2022. The International Energy Agency projects global EV sales to grow from 3 million vehicles in 2020 to about 25 million vehicles in 2030, a 24 percent compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) over this time period.


These market demands well position Blink for rapid growth in its EV charging network, the number of its members, and its site host property partners’ expansion. Blink has been preparing for this high-growth environment through its planning initiatives, including securing large national and international strategic partnerships and agreements, and further developing the Company’s technology. These strategic actions will help ensure the Company is well positioned to meet the growing infrastructure demand both in the United States and globally. In addition to meeting the required demand for EV charging infrastructure, Blink’s unique, owner-operator focused business models help the Company significantly benefit from increased utilization as the industry expands through revenue share at Blink-owned charging stations.

Differentiated but Flexible Business Models. We own, operate and supply proprietary electric vehicle charging equipment and networked EV charging services. We believe that our ability to flexibly provide various business models, including a comprehensive turnkey solution, to Property Partners and leverage our technology to meet both Property Partners’ and EV drivers’ needs provides us competitive advantage in addition to more compelling long-term growth opportunities than possible through equipment sales only.
 
Ownership and Control of EV Charging Stations and Services. We own a large percentage of our charging stations, which is a significant differentiation between us and some of our primary competitors. This ownership model allows us to control the settings and pricing for our EV charging services, service the equipment as necessary, and have more effective brand management and price uniformity. As for those stations that we do not own, we are using our best efforts to encourage their owners to keep the stations operating in good order and, in some cases, to replace faulty stations with our new charging stations equipment.
 
Experience with Products and Services of Other EV Charging Service Providers. From our early days and through our acquisitions, we have had the experience of owning and operating EV charging equipment manufactured by other EV charging service providers, including General Electric, ChargePoint, and SemaConnect. This experience has provided us with the working knowledge of other equipment manufacturers’ benefits and drawbacks and their applicable EV charging networks.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
Our objective is to continue becoming a leading provider of EV charging solutions by deploying mass-scale EV charging infrastructure. By doing so, we aim to enable the accelerated growth of EV adoption and the EV industry. Key elements of our growth strategy include:

● | Pursue Strategic Opportunities to Expand Blink-Owned Turnkey and Hybrid Models. We have structured our business to identify and pursue opportunities to develop Blink’s owner and operator business model with locations with potential high utilization, where grant monies are available, and where we can realize long-term benefit for the EV charging location and establish long-term recurring revenue relationships. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Relentless Focus on Customer Satisfaction. We aim to increase overall customer satisfaction with new and existing Property Partners and EV drivers by upgrading and expanding the EV charging footprint throughout high-demand, high-density geographic areas. Another objective is to improve productivity and utilization of existing EV charging stations and enhance the valuable features of our EV charging station hardware and the Blink Network. 
● | Continue to Invest in Technology Innovations. We will continue to enhance the product offerings available in our EV charging hardware, cloud-based software, and networking capability. This includes the design and launch of our next generation of EV charging solutions, including accelerating the charge currents currently available in EV charging hardware and new, robust Blink Network features to stay ahead of the competition. Our key service solutions allow us to remain technology agnostic so that, if market conditions shift, we have the option to leverage pure-play hardware providers to augment our products. In 2021, we opened a new office near New Delhi, India. The new office in India is the first within the country for Blink and is part of the Company’s strategic goal to grow the global engineering team and develop an operational hub to facilitate expansion into new international regions. 
● | Strengthen and Support our Human Capital. Our experienced employees and management team are our most valuable resources. Attracting, training, and retaining key personnel has been and will remain critical to our success.

● | Leverage Our Early Mover Advantage. We continue to leverage our extensive and defendable first-mover advantage and the digital customer experience we have created for both EV drivers and Property Partners. We believe that tens of thousands of Blink driver registrants appreciate the value of transacting charging sessions on an established, robust network. Blink chargers are deployed across the United States, and the tendency, among users, is to stay within one consistent network. 
● | Appropriately Capitalize Our Business. We continue to pursue new potential capital sources to deliver critical operational objectives and the necessary resources to execute our overall strategy. The EV charging industry as a whole is undercapitalized to deliver the full potential of the expected EV market growth in the near future. We expect to retain our leadership position with new growth capital as required. 
● | International Expansion. On May 10, 2021, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary in the Netherlands, Blink Holdings, B.V., closed on the acquisition from the shareholders of Blue Corner NV, a Belgian company (“Blue Corner”), of all of the outstanding capital stock of Blue Corner. Headquartered in Belgium, with sales representative offices in several other European cities, Blue Corner owns and operates an EV charging network across Europe. The acquisition of Blue Corner was made to enter the European market and provide an opportunity to expand the Company’s footprint in this region. As a key contributor to the expanding EV landscape, we are continuously looking for opportunities to strategically increase our global assets while also making EV charging more accessible. International expansion is fundamental to our rapid growth and will accelerate the success we are already achieving in the region. 

Sales
 
Blink’s sales organization builds and maintains long-term business relationships with our customers by utilizing our four core business models. These business models provide a high degree of flexibility to match host location goals and objectives for EV charging with our industry-leading equipment acquisition solutions. Our team identifies locations that have the potential to create long-term, recurring value for the Property Partner and Blink. Sales personnel are able to pivot to traditional equipment sales or charging-as-a-service models when, and if, a location is not identified as a promising generator of future recurring revenues. The team strives to maintain a balance between equipment sales that grow revenue today, and site locations that have potential to generate strong revenues in the future under our owner-operator business models.
 
Blink also engages with strategic reseller partners across a range of vertical markets both within the U.S. and globally. These resellers typically have unique relationships or capabilities within their respective markets and provide Blink with additional sales opportunities. These resellers amplify Blink’s sales reach and are authorized to sell our EV charging hardware, software services (connectivity to Blink Network), and extended warranty service plans, to strategic site hosts and in specific locations.
 
Blink is making further inroads into the residential charging station market where we sell Level 2 chargers through various internet channels, such as Amazon, Walmart.com, Lowes.com, and other online retailers, to reach the single-family residential charging market in the United States.
 
During 2021, Blink awarded several new prominent customers including General Motors, Ford, Jaguar-Land Rover, Hyundai, Kia, Subaru, AutoNation, Berkshire-Hathaway Automotive, Bridgestone, the City of San Antonio, the Related Group, and others. During 2020, Blink awarded several new prominent customers, including Cushman & Wakefield, Reef Technology, Lehigh Valley Health, St. Luke’s University Health Network, Lion Electric, and several others, that expand Blink’s potential for unit sales and deployments. Commensurate with these new business relationships, we also forged critical strategic relationships with organizations that directly or indirectly influence EV charging station purchase decisions. Examples include Sustainable Westchester in New York, and Clean Cities Organizations in Virginia, Vermont and Ohio.
 
In addition to adding sales personnel within key markets, we solidified our organizational structure through hiring talented business development professionals and establishing a new account management team to onboard customers and maintain long-term relationships.
 
Our in-house staff performs a variety of marketing activities. Our marketing team works to promote and sell our services to property owners and managers, parking companies, and EV drivers. We also utilize marketing and communication channels, including press releases, email marketing, website (www.blinkcharging.com), pay-per-click advertising, social media marketing, webinars, sponsorships and partnerships, advertising, and conferences. Our websites’ information is not, and will not be deemed, a part of this Annual Report or incorporated into any other filings we make with the SEC.
 
We continue to invest in improving our company-owned stations’ service and maintenance and those stations with service and maintenance plans and expanding our cloud-based network capabilities. We anticipate continuing to grow our revenues by (i) selling our next generation of EV charging equipment to current as well as to new Property Partners, which includes airports, auto dealers, healthcare/medical, hotels, mixed-use, municipal locations, multifamily residential and condos, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institutions, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations, and (ii) expanding our sales channels to wholesale distributors, utilities, auto original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), solar integrators, and dealers, which will include implementing EV charging station occupancy fees (after charging is completed, fees for remaining connected to the charging station beyond an allotted grace period), and subscription plans for EV drivers on our company-owned public charging locations.

Our Customers and Partners
 
We have strategic partnerships across numerous transit/destination locations, including airports, auto dealers, healthcare/medical, hotels, mixed-use and municipal locations, multifamily residential and condos, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institutions, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations. We have hundreds of Property Partners that include well-recognized companies, large municipalities, and local businesses. We strive to engage all Blink-owned turnkey and hybrid property partners with exclusive EV charging contracts. This strategy further supports our owner-operator model to generate recurring revenue for both the Property Partner and Blink. Representative examples are McDonald’s, Sony Pictures, Caltrans, Porsche Design Tower, City of Azusa, City of Chula Vista, City of Springfield, City of Tucson, Federal Realty, Fred Meyer Stores, Inc., Fry’s Food & Drug, Inc., JBG Associates, LLC, Kroger Company and Ralphs Grocery Company. We continue to establish new contracts with Property Partners that previously secured our services independently or had contracts with the EV services providers that we acquired, including Ecotality, the former owner of the Blink-related assets.
 
Our revenues are primarily derived from fees charged to EV drivers for EV charging in public locations, EV charging hardware sales, government grants, and sales of equipment warranties. EV charging fees to drivers are based on an hourly rate, by energy dispensed per kilowatt-hour (“kWh”), or by session. Such fees are calculated based on various factors, including associated station costs and local electricity tariffs. EV charging hardware is sold to our Property Partners such as InterEnergy, Green Commuter, Nashville Music Center, Wendy’s, and other Property Partners engaged with our host-owned business model. Other income sources from EV charging services are network fees, extended warranty fees, membership fees, and payment processing fees paid by our Property Partners. Blink generates revenues from its ride-sharing program through BlueLA and the City of Los Angeles which allows customers the ability to rent electric vehicles through a subscription service.
 
We teamed up with Google Maps to make locating EV charging stations straightforward and accessible. Our charging stations are displayed in Google Maps, along with other relevant information.
 
We are focused on international expansion and have made significant progress in the last year at expanding our business across the globe, focusing primarily on Europe, Israel, and Latin America. In May 2021, we purchased the Belgian EV car charging company Blue Corner NV, managed through our international holdings subsidiary, Blink Holdings BV in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Additionally, we utilize Blink Charging Ltd. for our expansion in Israel and Blink Hellas SA for our expansion in Greece. We are in the process of incorporating numerous subsidiaries in Latin America as we further concentrate our international efforts. Finally, we established a new software development team in India, managed by our subsidiary Blink Charging Software Solutions Ltd.
 
We expanded our efforts on diversification, public service, and focus on renewable energy. We established a new committee of the Board of Directors, the Environmental, Social & Governance Committee (ESG), and adopted a new diversity statement. Our Human Resources Department led several successful climate initiatives throughout the year, including a cleanup of Miami Beach. Although we are still primarily working remotely and have not required employees to return to our new offices, our company culture is stronger than ever.
 
Our Competition
 
The EV charging equipment and service market is highly competitive, and we expect the market to become increasingly competitive as new entrants enter this growing market. Our products and services compete on product performance and features, the total cost of ownership, sales capabilities, financial stability, brand recognition, product reliability, and the installed base’s size. Our existing competition currently includes ChargePoint, which manufactures EV charging equipment and operates the ChargePoint Network, and Evgo, which offers home and public charging with pay-as-you-go and subscription models. Other entrants into the connected EV charging station equipment market include Volta, Clipper Creek, SemaConnect, and EV Connect. We believe these additional competitors struggle with gaining the necessary network traction but could gain momentum in the future. While Tesla does offer EV charging services, the connector type currently restricts the chargers to Tesla vehicles only. Many other EV charging companies offer non-networked or “basic” chargers with limited customer leverage but could provide a low-cost solution for basic charger needs in commercial and home locations.
 
Our competitive advantage in this market includes our exclusive, long-term contracts with our Property Partners and flexible business models. We offer our EV charging station equipment and provide access to a robust EV charging network.

Government Grants
 
Blink has established a full-time dedicated team to identify and process federal and state funding opportunities for EV charging infrastructure development. Blink is committed to pursuing EV charging development grant opportunities in all 50 states. Funding sources include the United States Department of Energy, the United States Department of Transportation, the VW mitigation settlement trust fund, and funding initiatives from utility service providers.
Government Regulation and Incentives
 
State, regional and local regulations for installing EV charging stations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may include permitting requirements, inspection requirements, licensing of contractors, and certifications. Compliance with such regulations may cause installation delays.
 
Currently, we apply charging fees by the kWh for our services in states that permit this policy and hourly and by session for our services in states that do not permit per kWh pricing. California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, and Washington have determined that companies that sell EV charging services to the public will not be regulated as utilities, allowing us to charge fees based on kWh usage. These individual state determinations are not binding on any other regulator or jurisdiction. However, they demonstrate a trend in the way states view the industry. Other jurisdictions are in the process of adopting such reforms.
 
We intend to continue to vigorously seek additional grants, loans, rebates, subsidies, and incentives as cost-effective means of reducing our capital investment in the promotion, purchase and installation of charging stations where applicable. We expect these incentives, rebates, and tax credits to be critical to our future growth. Additionally, some incentives are currently offered to encourage electric vehicle adoption at the federal, state and local levels. The Federal government provides a personal income tax credit for qualified plug-in electric vehicles, with a minimum credit of $2,500 and a maximum of $7,500, depending on vehicle weight and battery capacity. Such credits begin to phase out when the vehicle manufacturer reaches certain production levels. States such as California, Colorado, Delaware, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island offer various rebates, grants, and tax credits to incentivize EV and EVSE purchases.
 
CESQG
 
As a Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generator (“CESQG”), we generate a limited quantity of hazardous waste, mainly solvent contaminated wipes, which are transported to local solid waste facilities. Scrapped electronic boards are transported to a local recycler. A CESQG of hazardous waste is defined as a generator that:

● | produces no more than 100 kg (220 lbs.) of hazardous waste per month; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We intend to regularly assess opportunities for seeking patent protection for those aspects of our technology, designs and methodologies that we believe provide a meaningful competitive advantage. If we cannot do so, our ability to protect our intellectual property or prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights may be impaired.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
Our experienced employees and management team are some of our most valuable resources, and we are committed to attracting, motivating, and retaining top professionals. As of December 31, 2021, we had 198 employees, including 191 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 
Our success is directly related to the satisfaction, growth, and development of our employees. We strive to offer a work environment where employee opinions are valued and allow our employees to use and augment their professional skills. To achieve our human capital goals, we intend to remain focused on providing our personnel with entrepreneurial opportunities to expand our business within their areas of expertise and continue to provide our personnel with personal and professional growth. Blink emphasizes several measures and objectives in managing our human capital assets, including, among others, employee safety and wellness, talent acquisition and retention, employee engagement, development and training, diversity and inclusion, and compensation and pay equity.
 
COVID-19 and Employee Safety and Wellness. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. These measures include allowing most employees to work from home and implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. We believe in supporting our employees’ health and well-being. Our goal is to help employees make informed decisions about their health by providing the tools and resources necessary to achieve a healthier lifestyle. We offer our employees a wide array of benefits such as life and health (medical, dental, and vision) insurance, paid time off and retirement benefits, as well as emotional well-being services through our health insurance program.
 
Diversity and Inclusion and Ethical Business Practices. We believe that a company culture focused on diversity and inclusion is a crucial driver of creativity and innovation. We also believe that diverse and inclusive teams make better business decisions, ultimately driving better business outcomes. We are committed to recruiting, retaining, and developing high-performing, innovative and engaged employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences. This commitment includes providing equal access to, and participation in, equal employment opportunities, programs, and services without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, stereotypes, or assumptions based thereon. We welcome and celebrate our teams’ differences, experiences, and beliefs, and we are investing in a more engaged, diverse, and inclusive workforce.
 
We expanded our efforts on diversification, public service, and focus on renewable energy. We established a new committee of the Board of Directors, the Environmental, Social & Governance Committee (ESG), and adopted a new diversity statement. Our Human Resources Department led several successful climate initiatives throughout the year, including a cleanup of Miami Beach.
 
Blink also fosters a strong corporate culture that promotes high standards of ethics and compliance for our business, including policies that set forth principles to guide employee, officer, director, and vendor conduct, such as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. We also maintain a whistleblower policy and anonymous hotline for the confidential reporting of any suspected policy violations or unethical business conduct on the part of our businesses, employees, officers, directors, or vendors.
