Item 1. Business.
Prior Operations
 
We were incorporated on July 15, 2002 under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name Titan Web Solutions, Inc. with a view to offering a full range of business consulting services in the retail specialty coffee industry in China.
 
On April 9, 2015 we merged with our wholly-owned subsidiary Cyber Apps World Inc. and concurrently changed our name to Cyber Apps World Inc. Our business focused on the development of mobile applications focusing on allowing users around the world to save money on products and services from member merchants and suppliers instantly with mobile coupons, using their desktops and/or mobile devices, including smartphones. We have not been successful in developing revenue from our operations. 
 
Privacy and Value Software
 
On March 15, 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire employee monitoring software known as “Privacy and Value”. We amended this agreement on April 20, 2021 and September 28, 2022. The software product attempts to balance employer concerns regarding employee efficiency and productivity with employee privacy.
 
As companies are increasingly attempting to meet the demands of employees that want work environment flexibility and are forced to avoid employee congregation in response to the current global Covid-19 pandemic, they are retaining staff that either work from home or they rely on outsourcing to retain employees and independent contractors in other countries. One of the primary concerns with having staff work in a separate location that removes them from the daily, direct oversight of management is that employee productivity will suffer. One of the responses to this concern is for businesses to use some form of worker surveillance in order to ensure that employees are utilizing their work time efficiently. However, businesses may face pushback from their staff due to concerns that their personal privacy is compromised when they are subject to constant monitoring during work hours. They may resist practices such as webcam surveillance or persistent computer screen observation.
 
To address employer concerns regarding staff efficiency and employee concerns regarding privacy, we intend market and sell the Privacy and Value software that has features to monitor worker computer productivity while providing employees with reasonable privacy during their work days. The features of the software are as follows:
 

● | the software will monitor the employees’ computer desktops while they are actually working on the system. Surveillance will commence when an employee logs on to his or her computer through our software and will continue until the employee logs out of the system. After an employee signs out of the software, recording and monitoring will cease and the employee can access his or her computer contents and the Internet for personal purposes;

● | when the employee is logged in, the software will allow management to maintain real-time access to employee activity and to view each employee’s desktop screen content and the keystrokes that the employee is typing. All of this information will also be recorded and stored for future management use with all information time stamped. The file name for each day’s recording will be the employee’s first name, last name, and the year, month, and day, which will allow a manager to identify the appropriate recording without difficulty; and

● | based on employee actions, the software will calculate the amount of time that the employee was logged into the system based on a searchable time period (e.g., a shift, a week, or a month). It will also indicate the length of various time periods during which the employee did not make any keystrokes on his or her computer and allow the manager to quickly access the recording of employee’s desktop at the times when keystrokes commenced and stopped. The software will also provide details of the length of each break that the employee takes during the work period analyzed. It will also have tools that the manager can use, in tabular and graphic form, to compare the efficiency of employees in terms of keystrokes and time logged in to their computer.

In consideration of the vendor selling the Privacy and Value software to us, we have agreed to:
 

(a) | pay $10,000 to the vendor upon execution of the agreement; and

(b) | pay, by March 31, 2023, an amount equal to the estimation of value of a 50% interest in the Software and the related data and databases based on an independent business valuation completed by a valuator who is accredited by the American Society of Appraisers and acceptable to both parties less the $10,000 cash payment noted above. Notwithstanding the valuation’s estimation of value of the software, the amount of the additional payment shall not be less than $50,000 and shall not exceed $250,000. We obtained an independent business valuation on the Software in June 2021, which indicated that we would have to pay $250,000 to complete the acquisition of a 50% interest in the Software.

Friendly and Fast Delivery Service
 
We are currently developing a delivery computer application known as Friendly and Fast. The application is being designed to allow users to order food, groceries, and other courier services. Friendly and Fast’s focus will strictly be delivery of goods.
 
Friendly and Fast will target both individuals and corporate customer segments. For corporate clients, this feature will give discounts to restaurant owners, grocery stores, couriers, and similar enterprises so they can affordably provide deliveries to their customers. We are currently organizing beta testing of the application in Ahmedabad, India and have commissioned a private company to be primarily responsible for the completion of the application development.
 
Financial Condition
 
Our financial statements for the period ended July 31, 2022, and 2021 have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. We have not generated any significant revenue as of July 31, 2022. Management recognizes that our continued existence is dependent upon its ability to obtain needed working capital through additional equity and/or debt financing and revenue to cover expenses as we continue to incur losses.
 
Since our incorporation, we have financed our operations almost exclusively through our sale of equity and through advances from our shareholders. Management’s plans are to finance operations through the sale of equity or other investments for the foreseeable future, as we may not receive significant revenue from our and proposed business operations. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in arranging financing on acceptable terms.
 
Our ability to raise additional capital is affected by trends and uncertainties beyond its control. We do not currently have any arrangements for financing, and we may not be able to find such financing if required. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number of factors, including investor sentiment. Market factors may make the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing unavailable to us. These uncertainties raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Competition
 
Friendly and Fast Application
 
There is intense competition between traditional taxi and courier companies, and delivery service companies. Companies providing ride-hailing services are transitioning from providing traditional taxi services to additional services, such as ride sharing and food and consumer goods delivery, in order to expand the overall market for transportation services.
 
The delivery service market is quite fragmented as there is high competition in the market among major players. Since this market is expanding, new entrants are emerging as well. We will compete with other delivery service companies, including Uber Eats, Skip The Dishes, Door Dash, and Grubhub that are well-established in North America. In other markets where we may wish to expand, there are also well-established regional companies, such as DiDi (China), Ola (India), Grab (southeast Asia), Bolt (Europe, Africa, and the Middle East), and Cabify (South America). These companies generally have greater financial and technical resources, industry expertise, and managerial capabilities than we do. Most of our competitors benefit from established brand awareness with current and prospective customers.
 
We believe that industry competition for customers is primarily based on brand recognition, marketing, price, and quality of service. We hope to be able to compete effectively based on these factors though we primarily hope to develop a niche market by providing lower commission charges to restaurants that agree to utilize our food delivery services and by developing underexplored markets, such as businesses that use local courier services for non-food deliveries and rely on traditional vehicle courier companies.
 
Privacy and Value Software
 
The software and computer application development business are also extremely fragmented and competitive. The sector includes large, established corporations that develop their products in-house and have the capability and financial resources necessary in order to launch and market their products, as well as large custom software development companies that design products according to client specifications, such as Praxent, Orases, 10Pearls, Fingent, Tack Mobile, and Mercury Development. Additionally, there are smaller niche market participants that focus on a single or small number of products that are well-tailored to specific commercial or consumer demands. Many of these competitors have international operations and are able to not only compete in terms of software quality, but also based on price given their access to software development talent in developing countries, such as India, where skilled labor is less expensive.
Patents and Trademarks
 
Due to the costs involved and the potential inability to qualify, we have not filed for patent protection of our products and our trademarks. We have not sought legal advice regarding whether or not patent protection of our technology is possible. Accordingly, our business is subject to the risk that competitors could either copy our technology or release competing products.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to laws that require protection of user privacy and user data. In our processing of account registrations, we will receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable data. This data is increasingly subject to laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, including the United States through its Privacy Act and the Commission of the European Union through its General Data Protection Regulation. Such government action is typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected, processed, and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.
 
In addition, our long-term business strategy may include geographic expansion into additional jurisdictions, many of which regions and countries have different legislation, regulatory environments, and tax laws. Compliance with legal, regulatory, and tax requirements around the world places demands on our time and resources, and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal, regulatory, or tax consequences, which may have an adverse effect on our business.
