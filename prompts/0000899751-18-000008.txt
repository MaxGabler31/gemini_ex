• | History

The Company traces its roots to the Electric Wheel Company in Quincy, Illinois, which was founded in 1890.  Titan was incorporated in 1983.  The Company has grown through six major acquisitions.  In 2005, Titan Tire Corporation, a subsidiary of the Company, acquired The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company’s North American farm tire assets.  In 2006, Titan Tire Corporation of Bryan, another subsidiary of the Company, acquired the OTR tire assets of Continental Tire North America, Inc.  In 2011, the Company acquired The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company's Latin American farm tire business. In 2012, the Company purchased a 56% controlling interest in Planet Corporation Group, now known as Titan Australia. Also in 2012, the Company completed its acquisition of Titan Europe. Through separate acquisitions in 2013 and 2014, the Company, in partnership with One Equity Partners (OEP) and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), acquired all of the equity interests in Voltyre-Prom, a leading producer of agricultural and industrial tires in Volgograd, Russia. These acquisitions have allowed Titan to expand its global footprint and enhance product offerings in the Company’s target markets. 
COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
Titan’s strong market position in the off-highway wheel, tire, and undercarriage market and its long-term core customer relationships contribute to the Company’s competitive strengths.  Titan produces both wheels and tires which allows the Company to provide a one-stop solution for its customers' wheel and tire assembly needs. These strengths, along with Titan’s dedication to the off-highway equipment market, continue to drive the Company forward.

• | Strong Market Position

As a result of Titan’s offering of a broad range of specialized wheels, tires, assemblies, and undercarriage systems and components, Titan is a leader in the global off-highway market.  Through an extensive dealer network and sales force, the Company is able to reach an increasing number of aftermarket and OEM customers and build Titan’s image and brand recognition.  The Company’s acquisition of the Goodyear Farm Tire brand in North America and Latin America contributes to overall visibility and customer confidence. Through the 2012 acquisition of Titan Europe and the expansion of the Goodyear Farm Tire brand into Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) in 2015, Titan has strengthened the Company's presence in Europe. Additionally, the 2013 acquisition of Voltyre-Prom expanded Titan's footprint into the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region. Years of product design and engineering experience have enabled Titan to improve existing products and develop new ones, such as Low Sidewall (LSW®), that have been well received in the marketplace.  Titan believes it has benefited from significant barriers to entry, such as the substantial investment necessary to replicate the Company’s manufacturing equipment and numerous tools, dies and molds, many of which are used in custom processes. 

• | Wheel and Tire Manufacturing Capabilities

The Company’s position as a manufacturer of both wheels and tires allows Titan to mount and deliver one of the largest selections of off-highway assemblies in North America. Titan offers this value-added service of one-stop solution for wheel and tire assemblies for the agricultural, earthmoving/construction, and consumer segments.  Both standard and LSW assemblies are delivered as a single, complete unit based on each customer’s specific requirements.

In addition, Titan continues to improve operating efficiencies and gain additional synergies. 

• | Low Sidewall Technology

The Company has developed an LSW tire technology, featuring a larger rim diameter and a smaller sidewall than standard tires. With LSW tire technology, which has been widely adopted within the automotive industry, users experience reduced power hop, road lope, soil compaction, and fuel consumption as well as improved safety and performance. Both power hop and road lope can disturb ride quality and impede equipment performance. The benefits correspond to Titan’s markets through superior comfort, ride and fuel economy. Titan continues to enhance the LSW technology and expand its LSW product offering in both the agricultural and construction segments. Titan’s capabilities as both a wheel and tire manufacturer allow the Company to drive further adoption within these markets. Titan seeks to be at the forefront of off-road equipment advancement through the innovation of its LSW solution with the goal that it will become the industry standard.

• | Increase Aftermarket Tire Business

The Company has concentrated on increasing Titan's presence in the tire aftermarket, which historically has been somewhat less cyclical than the OEM market. The aftermarket also offers the potential for higher profit margins and is a larger market. Titan’s strategy to enhance the Company's aftermarket platform, which began in mid-2016, focuses on improving the customer experience and product positioning in key sales markets. To support this strategy, the Company has maintained and supported Titan's salesforce for the tire aftermarket throughout the recent industry downturn.

• | Improve Operating Efficiencies

The Company regularly works to improve the operating efficiency of assets and manufacturing facilities. Titan integrates each facility’s strengths through, among others, transfer of equipment and business to the facilities that are best equipped to handle the work, which enables Titan to increase utilization and spread operating costs over a greater volume of products. Titan continues to implement a comprehensive program to refurbish, modernize, and enhance the technology of its manufacturing equipment. Titan has also made investments to streamline processes, increase productivity, and lower costs in the selling, general and administrative areas.

OPERATIONS
Titan’s operations include manufacturing wheels, manufacturing tires, combining these wheels and tires into assemblies, and manufacturing undercarriage systems and components for use in the agricultural, earthmoving/construction, and consumer markets.  These operations entail many manufacturing processes in order to complete the finished products.

• | Wheel Manufacturing Process

Most agricultural wheels are produced using a rim and a center disc. A rim is produced by first cutting large steel sheets to required width and length specifications. These steel sections are rolled and welded to form a circular rim, which is flared and formed in the rollform operation. The majority of discs are manufactured using presses that both blank and form the center to specifications in multiple stage operations. The Company e-coats wheels using a multi-step process prior to the final paint top coating.

Large earthmoving/construction steel wheels are manufactured from hot and cold-rolled steel sections. Hot-rolled sections are generally used to increase cross section thickness in high stress areas of large diameter wheels. A special cold forming process for certain wheels is used to increase cross section thickness while reducing the number of wheel components. Rims are built from a series of hoops that are welded together to form a rim base. The complete rim base is made from either three or five separate parts that lock together after the rubber tire has been fitted to the wheel, the parts have been fully assembled, and the assembly inflated.

For most wheels in our consumer segment, the Company manufactures rims and center discs from rolled and flat steel. Rims are rolled and welded, and discs are stamped and formed from the sheets. The manufacturing process then entails welding the rims to the centers and painting the assembled product.

• | Tire Manufacturing Process

The first stage in tire production is the mixing of rubber, carbon black, and chemicals to form various rubber compounds. These rubber compounds are then extruded and processed with textile or steel materials to make specific components. These components – beads (wire bundles that anchor the tire with the wheel), plies (layers of fabric that give the tire strength), belts (fabric or steel fabric wrapped under the tread in some tires), tread, and sidewall – are then assembled into an uncured tire carcass. The uncured carcass is placed into a press that molds and vulcanizes the carcass under set time, temperature, and pressure into a finished tire.

• | Wheel and Tire Assemblies

The Company’s position as a manufacturer of both wheels and tires allows Titan to mount and deliver one of the largest selections of off-highway assemblies in North America. Titan offers this value-added service of one-stop solution for wheel and tire assemblies for the agricultural, earthmoving/construction, and consumer segments. Both standard and LSW assemblies are delivered as a single, complete unit based on each customer’s unique requirements.

• | Undercarriage Manufacturing Process

The undercarriage components (track groups, track and carrier rollers, idler assemblies, and sprockets) are all manufactured from steel and produced according to customer specifications.
 7

All of the track groups produced by the Company are built from four major parts: shoes, right and left hand links, pins, and bushings. Shoes are manufactured from steel cast in the Company foundry or obtained from different shapes of hot rolled profiles (depending on application), sheared to length, and then heat treated for high wear bending and breaking resistance. Right and left hand links are hot forged, trimmed, mass heat treated, machined, and finally induction hardened on rail surface for optimal wear and fatigue resistance. Pins are made from round bars that are cut, machined, heat treated, and surface finished. Bushings are generally cold extruded, machined, mass heat treated, and finally carburized or induction hardened for wear resistance and optimal toughness.

The lifetime lubricated and maintenance-free track and carrier rollers are assembled with two major components: single or double flange roller shells (typically hot forged in halves, deep hardened, friction or arc welded, and finish machined with metallurgical characteristics depending upon size and application) and shafts (generally cut from bars or forged, mass heat treated, rough machined, induction hardened, and ground).

The idler assemblies are also lifetime lubricated, for virtually no maintenance. They are offered with cast (single web or hollow design) or fabricated shells, depending on size and application, and feature induction-hardened tread surfaces for optimal wear resistance. 

The sprockets, designed to transfer the machine driving loads from the final drive to the track, are produced cast or forged in several geometric options, depending upon size and application. They are also heat treated for wear resistance and cracking resistance.

The undercarriage systems, custom designed and produced by the Company, consist of a structured steel fabricated frame, all the undercarriage components mentioned above (track groups, track and carrier rollers, idler assemblies, and sprockets) and a final drive. They are completely assembled in house, for consistent quality. 

• | Quality Control

The Company is ISO certified at all four main domestic manufacturing facilities located in Bryan, Ohio; Des Moines, Iowa; Freeport, Illinois; and Quincy, Illinois, as well as the majority of the foreign manufacturing facilities.  The ISO series is a set of related and internationally recognized standards of management and quality assurance.  The standards specify guidelines for establishing, documenting, and maintaining a system to ensure quality.  The ISO certifications are a testament to Titan’s dedication to providing quality products for its customers.
RAW MATERIALS
Steel and rubber are the primary raw materials used by the Company in all segments.  To ensure a consistent steel supply, Titan purchases raw steel from key steel mills and maintains relationships with steel processors for steel preparation.  The Company is not dependent on any single producer for its steel supply; however, some components do have limited suppliers.  Rubber and other raw materials for tire manufacture represent some of the Company’s largest commodity expenses.  Titan has developed a procurement strategy and practice designed to mitigate price risk and lower cost. Titan buys rubber in markets where there are usually several sources of supply.  In addition to the development of key domestic suppliers, the Company’s strategic procurement plan includes international steel and rubber suppliers to assure competitive price and quality in the global marketplace.  As is customary in the industry, the Company does not have long-term contracts for the purchase of steel or rubber and, therefore, purchases are subject to price fluctuations. 
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
Capital expenditures for 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $32.6 million, $41.9 million, and $48.4 million, respectively.  The capital expenditures in each year were used primarily for expanding capabilities, updating manufacturing equipment, and for further automation at the Company’s facilities. 
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, AND ROYALTIES
The Company owns various patents and trademarks and continues to apply for patent protection for new products.  Due to the difficult nature of predicting the interpretation of patent laws, the Company cannot anticipate or predict any material adverse effect on its operations, cash flows, or financial condition to the extent the Company is unable to protect its patents or should the Company be found to be infringing others' patents.
 8

The Company has trademark license agreements with The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company to manufacture and sell certain farm tires under the Goodyear name. These agreements cover sales in North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Russia, and other Commonwealth of Independent States countries. Each of these agreements expire in 2025. The North American and Latin American farm tire royalties were prepaid through March 2018 as a part of the 2011 Goodyear Latin American farm tire acquisition. The Company also has a trademark license agreement with Goodyear to manufacture and sell certain non-farm tire products in Latin America under the Goodyear name.
MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
The Company employs an internal sales force and utilizes several manufacturing representative firms for sales in North America, Europe, Latin America, the CIS region, and other worldwide locations.  Sales representatives are primarily organized within geographic regions.
Titan distributes wheels, tires, assemblies, and undercarriage systems directly to OEMs. The distribution of aftermarket tires occurs primarily through a network of independent and OEM-affiliated dealers.
SEASONALITY
Agricultural equipment sales are seasonal by nature.  Farmers generally order equipment to be delivered before the growing season.  Shipments to OEMs in the agricultural industry in the U.S. and Europe usually peak during the Company’s first and second quarters for the spring planting period, while shipments in Latin America usually peak during the Company's second and third quarters for the fall planting period.  Earthmoving/construction and consumer segments have historically experienced higher demand in the first and second quarters.  These segments are affected by mining, building, and economic conditions.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND ENGINEERING
The Company’s research, development, and engineering staff tests original designs and technologies and develops new manufacturing methods to improve product performance.  These services enhance the Company’s relationships with its customers. Titan's advantage as both a wheel and tire manufacturer allows the Company to design, test, and bring to market innovative solutions to meet the specific needs of its customers. For example, Titan has developed the LSW technology, featuring a larger rim diameter and a smaller sidewall than standard tires, which helps reduce power hop, road lope, soil compaction, and provides improved safety and performance. Research and development (R&D) expenses are expensed as incurred.  R&D costs were $10.3 million, $10.0 million, and $11.2 million for the years ending December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. 
CUSTOMERS
Titan’s 10 largest customers accounted for 32% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017, and 34% for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Net sales to Deere & Company in Titan’s agricultural, earthmoving/construction, and consumer segments combined represented 9% of the Company’s consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.  No other customer accounted for more than 7% of the Company’s net sales in 2017 or 2016.  Management believes the Company is not dependent on any single customer; however, certain products are dependent on a few customers.  While the loss of any substantial customer could impact Titan’s business, the Company believes that its diverse product mix and customer base should minimize a longer-term impact caused by any such loss.
ORDER BACKLOG
Titan estimates that, at January 31, 2018, it had $391 million in orders believed to be firm compared to $240 million at January 31, 2017.  The January 31, 2018, order amount included $109 million in the agricultural segment, $273 million in the earthmoving/construction segment, and $9 million in the consumer segment. The January 31, 2017, order amount included $81 million in the agricultural segment, $152 million in the earthmoving/construction segment, and $7 million in the consumer segment. The Company believes the above orders at January 31, 2018, will be filled during the current year. The Company does not believe that its backlog is material to, or a significant factor in, evaluating and understanding any of its business segments or its businesses considered as a whole.
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
The Company operates manufacturing facilities in Latin America. The Latin American operations accounted for 19% of the Company's net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
The Company operates facilities throughout Europe, which sell to OEM and aftermarket customers. The European operations accounted for 28% of the Company's net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
The Company operates a manufacturing facility in Volgograd, Russia. The Russian operations accounted for 7% of the Company's net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
 9

EMPLOYEES
At December 31, 2017, the Company employed approximately 6,300 people worldwide, including approximately 4,300 located outside the United States.
At December 31, 2017, the employees at each of the Company's Bryan, Ohio; Freeport, Illinois; and Des Moines, Iowa facilities, which collectively account for approximately 41% of the Company’s U.S. employees, were covered by collective bargaining agreements which expire in November 2021.
Outside the United States, the Company enters into employment agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction. 
The Company believes it has a good relationship with the members of its workforce.
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS
In the ordinary course of business, similar to other industrial companies, Titan is subject to extensive and evolving federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, and has made provisions for the estimated financial impact of potential environmental cleanup.  The Company’s policy is to accrue environmental cleanup-related costs of a non-capital nature when those costs are believed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.  Expenditures that extend the life of the related property, or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination, are capitalized. The Company does not currently anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.  The quantification of environmental exposures requires an assessment of many factors, including changing laws and regulations, advances in environmental technologies, the quality of information available related to specific sites, the assessment stage of the site investigation, preliminary findings, and the length of time involved in remediation or settlement.  Due to the difficult nature of predicting future environmental costs, the Company cannot anticipate or predict the material adverse effect on its operations, cash flows, or financial condition as a result of efforts to comply with, or its liabilities under, environmental laws. 
As of December 31, 2017, two of Titan’s subsidiaries were involved in litigation concerning environmental laws and regulations:

In October 2010, the United States of America, on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), filed a complaint against Dico, Inc. (Dico) and Titan Tire Corporation (Titan Tire) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, wherein the EPA sought civil penalties, punitive damages, and response costs against Dico and Titan Tire pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). 

In June 2015, Titan Tire and Dico appealed the U.S. District Court’s order granting the EPA’s motion for summary judgment that found Dico and Titan Tire liable for civil penalties and response costs for violating CERCLA and Dico liable for civil penalties and punitive damages for violating an EPA Administrative Order. 

In December 2015, the United States Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s summary judgment order with respect to “arranger” liability for Titan Tire and Dico under CERCLA and the imposition of punitive damages against Dico for violating the EPA Administrative Order, but affirmed the summary judgment order imposing civil penalties in the amount of $1.62 million against Dico for violating the EPA Administrative Order violation. The case was remanded to the District Court for a new trial on the remaining issues.
The trial occurred in April 2017. On September 5, 2017, the District Court issued an order: (a) concluding Titan Tire and Dico arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a); (b) holding Titan Tire and Dico jointly and severally liable for $5.45 million in response costs previously incurred and reported by the United States relating to the alleged violation, including enforcement costs and attorney’s fees; and (c) awarding a declaratory judgment holding Titan Tire and Dico jointly and severally liable for all additional response costs previously incurred but not yet reported or to be incurred in the future, including enforcement costs and attorney’s fees. The District Court also held Dico liable for $5.45 million in punitive damages under 42 U.S.C. § 9607(c)(3) for violating a unilateral administrative order. The punitive damages award does not apply to Titan Tire. The Company accrued a contingent liability of $6.5 million, representing $5.45 million in costs incurred by the United States and $1.05 million of additional response costs, for this order.
Titan Tire and Dico are appealing the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The Notice of Appeal was filed on November 2, 2017, and an appeal bond was secured to stay the execution of any collection actions on the underlying judgment pending the outcome of the appeal.

COMPETITION
The Company competes with several domestic and international companies, some of which are larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than Titan.  The Company believes it is a primary source of steel wheels and rims to the majority of its North American customers.  Major competitors in the off-highway wheel market include GKN Wheels, Ltd., Trelleborg Group, and Topy Industries, Ltd.  Significant competitors in the off-highway tire market include Alliance Tire Company Ltd., Balkrishna Industries Limited (BKT), Bridgestone/Firestone, Michelin, Mitas a.s., and Pirelli. Significant competitors in the undercarriage market include Berco and Caterpillar.

The Company competes on the basis of price, quality, sales support, customer service, design capability, and delivery time.  The Company's position of manufacturing both the wheel and the tire allows us to provide innovative assembly solutions for our customers, creating a competitive advantage in the marketplace. The Company’s ability to compete with international competitors may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations.  Titan owns the molds and dies used to produce its wheels and tires. However, certain of the Company’s OEM customers could elect to manufacture their own products to meet their requirements or to otherwise compete with the Company.  There can be no assurance that the Company will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates, or that competitors will not develop products that are more effective, less expensive, or otherwise render certain of Titan’s products less competitive.  From time to time, certain of the Company’s competitors have reduced their prices in particular product categories, which has prompted Titan to reduce prices as well.  There can be no assurance that competitors of the Company will not further reduce prices in the future or that any such reductions would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.
