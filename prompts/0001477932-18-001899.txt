Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
Cosmos Holdings Inc. ("us", "we", or the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 21, 2009 under the name Prime Estates and Developments, Inc. On November 14, 2013, we changed our name to Cosmos Holdings Inc.
 
On September 27, 2013, the Company closed a reverse take-over transaction pursuant to which it acquired a private company whose principal activities are the trading of products, providing representation, and provision of consulting services to various sectors as described below. Pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement between the Company and Amplerissimo Ltd. ("Amplerissimo"), a company incorporated in Cyprus, we acquired 100% of Amplerissimo's issued and outstanding common stock.
 
As a result of the reverse take-over transaction, Amplerissimo became our wholly-owned subsidiary. On August 1, 2014, Amplerissimo formed SkyPharm S.A. a Greek corporation ("SkyPharm"), a subsidiary that focuses on pharmaceutical products. As of July 22, 2015, the Hellenic Ministry of Health and more specifically the National Organization for Medicines granted the Company a license for the wholesale of pharmaceutical products for human use. The license is valid for a period of five years and pursuant to the EU directive of (2013/C343/02). SkyPharm is subject to the Guidelines of the Good Distribution Practices of the European Union (the "Good Distribution Practices") for the sale and distribution of medical products for human use. SkyPharm believes it has properly incorporated all the methodologies, procedures, processes and resources in order to be in accordance with the guidelines of the Good Distribution Practices. Our warehouse has been equipped with the proper equipment, specifically with the proper shelves, working tables, medicines, cold fridge and barcode machines to comply with all requirements. In addition, our headquarters have also been equipped with the proper office equipment, specifically with the bureau tables, chairs and the terminals for each one working station, as well as central hardware systems (Servers) and software programs (ERP & CRM platforms) that are essential for the efficient running of the business are already installed and in place. The Company commenced sales of pharmaceutical products in the beginning of November 2015.
 
In February 2017, we completed the acquisition of Decahedron Ltd., a United Kingdom Company. The principal activity of Decahedron is the same as the business of SkyPharm. It is the trading of branded and generic pharmaceutical products and medicines across mainly the European Union member states. Decahedron buys from pharmacies and other wholesale pharmaceutical companies and resells these products mainly to other EU countries. Thus, SkyPharm and Decahedron are each an operator and the mechanisms between the supply and demand sides in the wholesale market. The Company could be characterized as the middle ring of this distribution channel. Decahedron received its Wholesale Distribution Authorization for human use on November 7, 2013, from the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in accordance with Regulation 18 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) and it is subject to the provision of those Regulations and the Medicines Act 1971. This license will continue to remain in force from the date of issue by the Licensing Authority unless cancelled, suspended, revoked or varied as to the period of its validity or relinquished by the authorization holder. 
 
We are currently focusing our existing operations on expanding the business of SkyPharm and Decahedron and have concentrated our efforts on becoming an international pharmaceutical company. The Company's focus is on Branded Pharmaceuticals, Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines and Generic Pharmaceuticals. The Company also intends to expand into Cosmetic-Beauty Products, as well as Food Supplements and we target areas where we can build and maintain a strong position. The Company uses a differentiated operating model based on a lean, nimble and decentralized structure, an emphasis on low risk license acquisition as well as Research & Development and our ability to be better owners of pharmaceutical assets than others. This operating model and the execution of our Corporate Strategy are enabling the company to achieve sustainable growth and create shareholder value.
 
We regularly evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand through the acquisition of pharmaceutical products and companies in areas that will serve patients and customers and that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins. In particular, we look to continue to enhance our pharmaceutical and over the counter product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective acquisition and license opportunities.

We believe that the demand for reasonably-priced medicines, delivered in the highest quality, and constantly matching the requirements of reliable and comprehensive medical care, is set to increase in the years to come, with the population’s increasing life expectancy. With our product portfolio of non-patented and patented medicines, we contribute to the optimization of efficient medicinal care, and thereby to lowering costs both for health insurance funds and companies and for patients.
 
We assess the foreseeable development of the Company as being positive. We believe the pharmaceutical sector offers a large growth potential in the European trade market of medicines, if service, price and quality are strictly directed to-wards the customer requirements. We will continue to encounter the competition in the market by service, reliability and a high level of quality. On the procurement side we can access a wide range of supply possibilities. To minimize business risks we diversify our sources of supply Europe wide. We secure our high quality demands through careful supplier qualification and selection as well as active supplier management.
 
Business Environment
 
The Company conducts its business within the pharmaceutical industry and is active in both of the pharmaceutical markets branded and generic pharmaceutical products. 
 
The pharmaceutical industry is a highly competitive and is subject to comprehensive government regulations. Many factors may significantly affect the Company's sales of its products, including, but not limited to, efficacy, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance as well as our research and development of new products. To compete successfully for business in the healthcare industry, the Company must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages. Currently, most of the products that the Company is trading, compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, and are subject to potential competition from new products that competitors may introduce in the future.
 
Generic medicines are the pharmaceutical and therapeutic equivalents of branded pharmaceutical products and are generally marketed under their generic (chemical) names rather than by brand names. Typically, a generic drug may not be marketed until the expiration of applicable patent(s) on the corresponding branded product, unless a resolution of patent litigation results in an earlier opportunity to enter the market. Generic drugs are the same as branded products in dosage form, safety, efficacy, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use, but they are sold generally at prices below those of the corresponding branded products. Generic drugs provide a cost-effective alternative for consumers, while maintaining the same high quality, efficacy, safety profile, purity and stability of the branded product. We are not currently active yet in this market, we intend to sell generic products primarily in the European Market across multiple therapeutic categories in the near term.
 
The Company intends to start operating within the Health Products & Food Supplement industry markets. These specific industries are highly competitive and many factors may significantly affect the Company's sales of its products, including, but not limited to, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance. Currently the Company is not selling any cosmetic product neither food supplements. No assurances can be made that the Company will be able to gain entry into these markets.
 
Corporate Strategy
 
The main strategy initiative is focused on continuing our progress in becoming a Global Specialty Pharmaceutical Company Through the development of a lean and efficient operating model, we are committed to serving our customers while continuing to innovate and provide products that make a difference in the lives of patients. We strive to maximize our shareholders' value by adapting to market realities and customer needs.

We are committed to driving organic growth at attractive margins by improving execution, optimizing cash flow and leveraging our strong market position, while maintaining a streamlined cost structure throughout each of our businesses. Recently we began to reorganize to further align our organization to our customer’ needs in a more seamless and unified way, while supporting corporate strategy and accelerating growth. Implementing this disciplined, focused strategy has allowed us to significantly expand our business, and we believe we are well-positioned to grow revenue and increase operating income through the execution of the following key elements of our business strategy:
 
Specific areas of management's focus include:
 

- | Optimize and Grow Our Pharmaceutical Sourcing and Distribution Businesses. We believe we are well-positioned in size and market breadth to continue to grow our trading businesses as we invest to improve our operating and capital efficiencies. Sourcing and distribution, including specialty pharmaceuticals, anchors our growth and position in the pharmaceutical supply channel as we provide superior services and deliver value-added products, which improve the efficiency and competitiveness of healthcare providers, thus allowing the pharmaceutical supply channel to better deliver healthcare to patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Branded & Over the Counter Pharmaceuticals: Accelerating performance of growth drivers, increasing the profitability from high demand brands and investing in key pipeline development opportunities. 
- | Generic Pharmaceuticals: Capitalizing on encouraging demand trends for a differentiated product portfolio and focusing on developing or acquiring high barrier to entry products, including first to file or first to market opportunities that are difficult to formulate, difficult to manufacture or face complex legal and regulatory challenges. Acquiring dossiers and registrations for generic products, which require limited manufacturing start-up and development activities. 
- | Health Products & Food Supplements: Investing in high growth business segments with durable revenue streams and where possible and capable geographical expansion and penetration. 
- | Nutraceuticals: Investing in high growth business segments with durable revenue streams and where possible and capable geographical expansion and penetration. 
- | Research & Development: Committed to strategic R&D across each business unit with a particular focus on pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products with inherently lower risk profiles and clearly defined regulatory pathways. 
- | Acquisitions: Seeking to identify incremental development growth opportunities through acquisitions and product licensing. In addition to a focus on organic growth drivers, we are also actively pursuing accretive acquisitions that offer long-term revenue growth, margin expansion through synergies and the ability to maintain a flexible capital structure. 

 
To successfully execute our corporate strategy, we believe that the Company must adopt, incorporate and maintain the following core strengths (no assurances can be made that the Company will be able to effectively implement these strategies):
 
Diversification of our business to become a global specialty pharmaceutical company
 
In light of the evolving healthcare industry, we have to regularly evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand through acquisitions of products and companies in areas that will serve patients and customers and that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins. In particular, we look to continue to enhance our product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluating selective acquisition and license opportunities.

Focus on business differentiated generic pharmaceutical products.
 
Developing high-barrier-to-entry generic pharmaceutical products, including first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities that are difficult to formulate, difficult to manufacture or face complex legal and regulatory challenges. We believe products with these characteristics will face a lesser degree of competition and therefore provide longer product life cycles and higher profitability than commodity generic products.
 
We plan to optimize our generic products pipeline and portfolio as part of a strategic assessment of our generic business. We will retain only those marketed products that deliver acceptable returns on investment, thereby leveraging our existing platform to drive operational efficiency. 
 
Emphasis on vertical integration of pharmaceutical business units 
 
We are strategically seeking to expand our technology, manufacturing, handling and development capabilities to a diversified array of pharmaceutical products. We believe our comprehensive suite of technology, manufacturing and development capabilities increases the likelihood of success in commercializing high-barrier-to-entry products and obtaining first-to-file and first-to-market status on future products, yielding more sustainable market share and profitability. 
 
Sales and Marketing
 
The majority of our products are represented directly and indirectly through a dedicated sales force team. Our sales force targets mainly wholesale distributors and other healthcare providers. We sell our products principally through independent wholesale distributors, but we also sell directly to other healthcare providers such as; clinics, government agencies, independent retail and specialty pharmacies and independent specialty distributors. Customer service representatives are centralized in order to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective manner.
 
We believe this corporate strategy will allow us to maximize both the growth rate and profitability of the Company and at the same time to enhance shareholder value.
 
Products & Services
 
The current principal activity of SkyPharm is the trading of branded and generic pharmaceutical products and medicines across the European Union member states. SkyPharm operates as a buyer from wholesale pharmaceutical companies and as a reseller to other companies. The principal activity of Decahedron is the same as the business of SkyPharm. It is the trading of branded and generic pharmaceutical products and medicines across mainly the European Union member states. Decahedron buys from pharmacies and other wholesale pharmaceutical companies and resells these products mainly to other EU countries. Thus, SkyPharm and Decahedron are each an operator and the mechanism between the supply and demand sides in the wholesale market. The Company could be characterized as the middle ring of this distribution channel.

The operational business life cycle performed by the Company could be described as follows:
 

a. | Searching and analyzing within market the demand and price of medicines; 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b. | Demand list placement by the clients including specific medicines, volumes and prices;
c. | Research availability of the demanded medicines in the market; 
d. | Choosing the appropriate supplier based upon available medicines and volumes; 
e. | Order placement by the client; 
f. | Checking control of the relevant authorities; 
g. | Purchase of the medicines from the wholesaler; 


h. | Assortment and storage of the medicines in the Company's facilities;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------
i. | Packaging the medicines according to the buyer's order list; 
j. | Delivery of the medicines to clients facilities; and 
k. | Direct payment for the shipment. 

 
We believe that the entire aforementioned product life cycle would take approximately three weeks to one month, from the demand list to the payment for the shipment.
 
Our subsidiaries SkyPharm and Decahedron trade over 400 different types of pharmaceutical products with the principal products being the following:
 

Product Description | Percentage of Total Current Sales | Treatment 
--------------------+------------------------------------+--------------------------
SYMBICORT TURB. | 3.61% | Relief of asthma symptoms
ASCENCIA CONTOUR | 3.00% | Diabetes Care 
Xeplion PF | 2.19% | Antipsychotic 

 
We are formulating a broader and more diversified pharmaceutical product portfolio and a greater selection of targets for potential development. We target products with limited competition for reasons such as trading complexity or the market size, which make our pharmaceutical products a key growth driver of our portfolio and complementary to other product offerings.
 
Amplerissimo was the owner of SkyPharm which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cosmos Holdings. The information technology business of Amplerissimo is not a priority of the Company and we are not currently pursuing such business. The Company is focusing its efforts in expanding the pharmaceutical trading business.

Customers 
 
Through our subsidiaries, SkyPharm and Decahedron, we primarily sell pharmaceutical products directly to a limited number of large wholesale drug distributors who, in turn, supply-sell the products to other wholesalers, hospitals, pharmacies, governmental agencies across the European Union member states. Total revenues from the customers that accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2017 & 2016 are as follows:

 | 2017 | | | 2016
---------------------------+------+-------+---+-----
MPA Pharma GmbH | | 27.97 | % | | 39.61 | %
Beragena Arzneimittel GmbH | | 10.98 | % | | 5.05 | %
Farmakeftiko Kenro S.A. | | 1.42 | % | | 12.88 | %
Dr. Fisher Pharma B.V. | | 10.94 | % | | 5.34 | %

 
No other customer generated over 10% of our total revenues.
 
We have a diverse customer base that includes wholesalers and retail healthcare providers. We make a significant amount of our sales to a relatively small number of pharmaceutical wholesalers. These customers represent an essential part of the distribution chain of our products. Pharmaceutical wholesalers have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, significant consolidation in a worldwide basis. This consolidation resulted in these groups gaining additional purchasing leverage and consequently increasing the product pricing pressures facing our business. 
 
Geographic Markets
 
All of our revenues are generated from operations in the European Union or otherwise earned outside the U.S. All of our foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad, including price and currency exchange controls, fluctuations in the relative values of currencies, political and economic instability and restrictive governmental actions including. Our geographical market sales distribution of our total consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:

 | 2017 | | | 2016
--------------------------+------+--------+---+-----
Germany | | 49.66 | % | | 49.42 | %
United Kingdom of England | | 16.18 | % | | 16.19 | %
Netherlands | | 14.80 | % | | 8.35 | %
Greece | | 6.78 | % | | 19.07 | %
Ireland | | 4.77 | % | | 4.49 | %
Denmark | | 3.35 | % | | 0.00 | %
Poland | | 2.51 | % | | 2.30 | %
Italy | | 1.24 | % | | 0.07 | %
Jordan | | 0.07 | % | | 0.00 | %
France | | 0.56 | % | | 0.00 | %
Sweden | | 0.03 | % | | 0.11 | %
FYROM | | 0.02 | % | | 0.00 | %
Bulgaria | | 0.01 | % | | 0.00 | %
Portugal | | 0.02 | % | | 0.00 | %
Total | | 100.00 | % | | 100.00 | %

 
We currently sell the products to wholesalers through our own sales force. We do not sell directly to large drug store chains or through distributors in countries where we do not have our own sales staff. As part of our sales marketing and promotion program, we use direct advertising, direct mailings, trading techniques, direct and personal contacts, exhibition of products at medical conventions and sponsor medical education symposia. 
 


9

Suppliers
 
We obtain pharmaceuticals and over the counter pharmaceutical products directly from manufacturers and other wholesalers of pharmaceutical products, three of which set forth below, each accounted for more than 10% of our purchases in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable since we are committed to be the primary source of pharmaceutical products for a majority of our customers. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are strong. The 10 largest suppliers in fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 accounted for approximately 93% of our purchases.

 | 2017 | | | 2016
----------------------------------------+------+-------+---+-----
Medihelm Farmakapothiki S.A | | 35.86 | % | | 10.82 | %
Doc Pharma S.A | | 18.80 | % | | 49.63 | %
Nikolaos Katsinoulas Farmakapothiki S.A | | 13.35 | % | | 8.75 | %

 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, Medihelm S.A is considered to be a related party entity to the Company due to the fact that the managing director of Medihelm is the mother of Nikolaos Lazarou, the director of our UK subsidiary, Decahedron. 
 
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, DOC Pharma S.A is considered to be a related party entity to the Company due to the fact that the managing director of DOC Pharma is the wife of Mr. Grigorios Siokas, the Company’s CEO, who also served as the principal of DOC Pharma SA in the past.
 
Competition
 
Our pharmaceutical businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets. Many of our trading pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs that treat similar diseases or indications. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease of use, and cost effectiveness. The means of competition vary across product categories and business groups, demonstrating the value of our trading products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses.
 
Our competitors include other trading companies, smaller companies, with generic drug and consumer healthcare products. We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar to those treated by our trading pharmaceutical products.
 
Our competitive position in pharmaceutical sector is affected by several factors, including, among others, the amount and effectiveness of our and our competitors' promotional resources; customer acceptance; product quality; our and our competitors' introduction of new products, ingredients, claims, dosage forms, or other forms of innovation; and pricing, regulatory and legislative matters (such as product labeling, patient access and prescription). 
 
The Branded pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. Our products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout the EU territory and internationally as well. Competitors include many of the major brand name and generic manufacturers of pharmaceutical products. If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both. 
 


10

 
In the generic pharmaceutical market, we might face intense competition from other generic drug manufacturers, brand name pharmaceutical companies, existing brand equivalents and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs.
 
By specializing in high barrier to entry products, we endeavor to market more profitable and longer-lived products relative to commodity generic products. We believe that our competitive advantages include our integrated team-based approach to product development that combines our formulation, regulatory, legal and commercial capabilities; our ability to introduce new generic equivalents for brand-name drugs; our ability to meet customer expectations; and the breadth of our existing generic product portfolio offering.
 
Newly introduced Generic products with limited or no other generic competition typically garner higher prices. At the expiration of the exclusivity period, other generic distributors may enter the market, resulting in a significant price decline for the drug. Consequently, the maintenance of profitable operations in generic pharmaceuticals depends, in part, on our ability to select, develop and launch new generic products in a timely and cost efficient manner and to maintain efficient, high quality business capabilities.
 
Operating conditions have become more challenging under the mounting global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment. We continue to take measures to evaluate, adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs. We also seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our functions, including efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products. 
 
As far as Amplerissimo is concerned we face significant competition delivering data mining, statistical data analysis, research and analysis, negotiating services, credit risk analysis, credit management, conducting case studies, introduction services, e-commerce consulting, marketing management consulting, expansion strategies consulting, information systems consulting, and business management software consulting services. Therefore, the Company is less focused on developing the information technology of Amplerissimo, as compared with the pharmaceutical businesses of the other subsidiaries.
 
Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and some are better known than we are. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these organizations. As a result these competitors may:
 

- | Succeed in providing services that are equal to or superior to our services or that achieve greater market acceptance than our service; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Devote greater resources to developing, marketing or selling their services; 
- | Respond more quickly to new or emerging information or service technologies, which could render our services less preferable; 
- | Withstand competition in the industry more effectively than we can. 
- | Establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of our customers or prospective customers; and
- | Take advantage of other opportunities more readily than we can. 

 
Since there are no substantial barriers to entry into the markets in which we participate, we expect that additional competitors will continue to enter these markets.
 


11

 
We will compete based upon our flexibility to customize our services and products to our client's specific needs utilizing our knowledge of a large number service provides and what we believe is our ability to provide services at faster and more efficiently than our competitors with the same quality of service and finished products as our competitors. We also believe that these characteristics enable us to provide our services at lower cost than our competitors. 
 
Information Systems 
 
The Company operates its full-service wholesale pharmaceutical distribution facilities in the Europe on one primary enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system that provides for, among other things, electronic order entry by customers, invoice preparation and purchasing, and inventory tracking. We are currently making significant investments to enhance and upgrade the ERP system. 
 
Additionally, we are improving our entity-wide infrastructure environment to drive efficiency, capabilities, and speed to market. We will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology. For example, in an effort to comply with future pedigree and other supply chain custody requirements we expect to continue to make significant investments in our secure supply chain information systems.
 
The Company processes a substantial portion of its purchase orders, invoices, and payments electronically. However, it continues to make substantial investments to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers. The Company has integrated warehouse operating system, which are used to manage the majority of transactional volume. The warehouse operating system has improved the distribution services productivity and operating leverage.
 
Government Regulations
 
Government authorities in the EU and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, approval, manufacturing, labeling, post-approval monitoring and reporting, packaging, advertising and promotion, storage, distribution, marketing and export and import of pharmaceutical products. As such, our branded pharmaceutical products and the generic product candidates are subject to extensive regulation both before and after approval. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in, among other things, warning letters, civil penalties, delays in approving or refusal to approve a pharmaceutical product. 
 
Our business is mainly the trading of branded and generic pharmaceutical products and medicines within the EU member states. In order to be able to operate our business, we need to comply with EU regulations, as well as EU member states regulations that govern various operations of our business. The most important government regulation that applies in our business is the granting to our companies SkyPharm and Decahedron of the Authorization for Wholesale Distribution of Medicinal Products for human use. In order for this Authorization to be granted the companies need to always comply with certain Good Distribution Practices (GDP) that mainly assure the proper storage, handling, distribution and trade of the pharmaceutical products.
 
SkyPharm received its Authorization for the Wholesale Distribution of Medical Products for humans use on July 22, 2015, from the Hellenic Republic National Organization for Medicines in accordance with Law 1316/1983, and the inspection by the National Organization for Medicines dated July 16, 2015 in accordance with the Guidelines 2013/C31/01. The license is valid for five years and expires on July 22, 2020. 
 
Decahedron received its Wholesale Distribution Authorization for human use on November 7, 2013, from the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in accordance with Regulation 18 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) and it is subject to the provisions of those Regulations and the Medicines Act 1971. This License will continue to remain in force from the date of issue by the Licensing Authority unless cancelled, suspended, revoked or varied as to the period of its validity or relinquished by the authorization holder.

Product Insurance
 
We have insurance in place for our warehouses and the products in stock against any damage or theft, but we do not insure our products after the sale, since we are working under an Ex-works policy, and thus our clients are responsible for the transportation and the insurance of the products against any damage. In the future, we will continue to reevaluate our decision and may purchase product liability insurance to cover some of or all of our product liability risk.
Research and Development Expenditures
 
The Company, entered into a Research & Development agreement with Doc Pharma S.A., a pharmaceutical manufacturer company, certified under Good Manufacturer Practices (GMP), outlines the development and contract manufacturing of Cosmos Holdings' complete line of Nutraceutical Products.
