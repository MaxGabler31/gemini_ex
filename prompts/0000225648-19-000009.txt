Item 1. BUSINESS
The terms “we,” “our,” “ours,” “us,” “Covanta” and “Company” refer to Covanta Holding Corporation and its subsidiaries and the term “Covanta Energy” refers to our subsidiary Covanta Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries.
About Covanta Holding Corporation
We are organized as a holding company, which was incorporated in Delaware on April 16, 1992. We conduct all of our operations through subsidiaries, which are engaged predominantly in the business of waste and energy services. 
Our mission is to provide sustainable waste and energy solutions. We seek to do this through a variety of service offerings, including our core business of owning and operating infrastructure for the conversion of waste to energy (known as “energy-from-waste” or “EfW”). 
EfW facilities produce energy through the combustion of non-hazardous municipal solid waste (“MSW”) in specially-designed power plants. Most of our facilities are “mass-burn” facilities, which combust the MSW on an as-received basis without any pre-processing such as shredding, sorting or sizing. The process reduces the waste to an inert ash while extracting ferrous and non-ferrous metals for recycling. In addition to our mass-burn facilities, we own and/or operate additional facilities that use other processes or technologies, such as refuse-derived fuel facilities which process waste prior to combustion.
EfW serves two key markets as both a sustainable waste management solution that is environmentally superior to landfilling and as a source of clean energy that reduces overall greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. EfW is considered renewable under the laws of many states and under federal law. Our facilities are critical infrastructure assets that allow our customers, which are principally municipal entities, to provide an essential public service through sustainable practices.
Our EfW facilities earn revenue from both the disposal of waste and the generation of electricity, generally under long-term contracts, as well as from the sale of metals recovered during the EfW process. We operate and/or have ownership positions in 44 EfW facilities, the majority of which are in North America. In total, these facilities process approximately 22 million tons of solid waste annually, equivalent to 9% of post-recycled MSW generated in the United States. Our facilities produce approximately 10 million megawatt hours (“MWh”) of baseload electricity annually. We also operate waste management infrastructure, including 16 waste transfer stations, 20 material processing facilities, four landfills (primarily for ash disposal), one metals processing facility, and one ash processing facility (currently under construction), all of which are complementary to our core EfW business. 
Outside of North America, we operate and/or have equity interests in EfW projects in Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom (currently in development and/or under construction). We intend to pursue additional international EfW projects where the regulatory and market environments are attractive, primarily through our joint ventures with Green Investment Group ("GIG"). For additional information see Execution on Strategy below, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data- Note 3. New Business and Asset Management. Ownership and operation of facilities in foreign countries potentially involves greater political and financial uncertainties than we experience in the United States, as described below and discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
We have one reportable segment, which comprises our entire operating business. Additional information about our reportable segment and our operations by geographic area is contained in Item 8. Financial Statements And Supplementary Data — Note 6. Business Segment and Geographic Information. 
Environmental Benefits of Energy-from-Waste
We believe that EfW offers solutions to public sector leaders around the world for addressing two key issues: sustainable management of waste and renewable energy generation. We believe that the environmental benefits of EfW, as an alternative to landfilling, are clear and compelling: by processing municipal solid waste in EfW facilities, we reduce GHG emissions, lower the risk of groundwater contamination, and conserve land. EfW facilities reduce GHG emissions by displacing fossil-fuel fired grid electricity, recycling metals, and diverting MSW from landfills, which are the 3rd largest source of man-made methane, a GHG over 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide (“CO2”) over a 20-year period. At the same time, EfW generates clean, reliable energy from a renewable fuel source, thus reducing dependence on fossil fuels, the combustion of which is itself a major contributor of GHG emissions. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), using lifecycle tools such as its own Municipal Solid Waste Decision Support Tool, has found that, on average, approximately one ton of CO2-equivalent is reduced relative to landfilling for every ton of waste processed. Compared with fossil-fuel based generation, each ton of waste processed eliminates the need to consume approximately one barrel of oil or one-quarter ton of coal, in order to generate the equivalent amount of 
5

electricity. We believe EfW is also an important component of business and community efforts to divert post-recycled waste from landfills as part of their GHG, zero-waste-to-landfill, circular economy, and other sustainability initiatives. As public planners and commercial and industrial companies address their needs for more environmentally sustainable waste management and energy generation in the years ahead, we believe that EfW will be an increasingly attractive alternative.
Other Environmental Services Offerings
In addition to our core EfW business, we offer a variety of sustainable waste management solutions in response to customer demand, including on site clean-up services, wastewater treatment, pharmaceutical and healthcare solutions, reverse distribution, transportation and logistics, recycling and depackaging. Together with our processing of non-hazardous "profiled waste" for purposes of assured destruction or sustainability goals in our EfW facilities, we offer these services under our Covanta Environmental Solutions ("CES") brand. Through acquisitions and organic growth initiatives, we have expanded our network of facilities to enable us to provide a range of services to industrial customers for the treatment, recycling and/or disposal of their non-hazardous materials. These businesses are highly synergistic with our existing profiled waste business, offer us the opportunity to expand the geographical sourcing of our waste streams and expand our presence in the environmental services sector, allowing us to drive higher margin profiled waste volumes into our EfW facilities and access additional revenue growth opportunities.
STRATEGY
Each of our service offerings responds to customer demand for sustainable waste management services that are superior to landfilling according to the “waste hierarchy" and assists our customers in meeting their own zero-waste, zero-waste-to-landfill, circular economy, and other sustainability goals. As indicated above, each of our service offerings is focused on providing cost effective and sustainable solutions that leverage our extensive network of EfW facilities and transfer stations in North America.
We intend to pursue our mission through the following key strategies:

• | Preserve and grow the value of our existing portfolio. We intend to maximize the long-term value of our existing portfolio of facilities by continuously improving safety, health and environmental performance, working to provide superior customer service, continuing to operate at our historic production levels, maintaining our facilities in optimal condition, extending waste and service contracts, and conducting our business more efficiently. We intend to achieve organic growth by expanding our customer base, service offerings and metal recovery, adding waste, service or energy contracts, investing in and enhancing the capabilities of our existing assets, and deploying new or improved technologies, systems, processes and controls, all targeted at increasing revenue or reducing costs.


• | Expand through project development and/or acquisitions in selected attractive markets. We seek to grow our portfolio, primarily through development of new facilities or businesses, competitive bids for new contracts, and acquisitions, where we believe that market opportunities will enable us to utilize our skills and/or invest our capital at attractive risk-adjusted rates of return. We focus these efforts in markets where we currently have projects in operation or under construction, and in other markets with strong economic fundamentals and predictable legal and policy support. In addition to our focus on EfW and related waste sourcing activities, we are seeking to expand our environmental service offerings through both organic growth and acquisitions.

We believe that our approach to these opportunities is highly-disciplined, both with regard to our required rates of return on invested capital and the manner in which potential acquired businesses or new projects will be structured and financed. 

• | Develop and commercialize new technology. We believe that our efforts to protect and expand our business will be enhanced by the development of additional technologies in such fields as recycling, alternative waste treatment processes, combustion controls, emission controls and residue recycling, reuse or disposal. We have advanced our research and development efforts in some of these areas relevant to our EfW business, and have patents and patents pending for advances in controlling emissions.


• | Advocate for public policy favorable to EfW and other sustainable waste and materials management solutions. We seek to educate policymakers and regulators about the environmental and economic benefits of EfW and advocate for policies and regulations that appropriately reflect these benefits. Our business is highly regulated, and as such we believe that it is critically important for us, as an industry leader, to play an active role in the debates surrounding potential policy developments that could impact our business.


• | Maintain a focus on sustainability. Providing sustainable waste, materials, and energy services to our customers is the cornerstone of our business. Our corporate culture is focused on the triple bottom line of sustainability (people, planet, prosperity) in support of our mission. In addition to robust financial reporting, we are committed to transparently reporting our environmental, social and governance standards, policies, and performance through our corporate sustainability report. We seek to continuously improve our performance across these aspects to remain an industry leader.


• | Allocate capital efficiently for long-term shareholder value. We plan to allocate capital to maximize shareholder value by: investing in our existing businesses to maintain and enhance assets; investing in new projects and strategic acquisitions that offer attractive returns on invested capital and further our strategic goals; maintaining a strong balance sheet; and consistently returning capital to our shareholders.

EXECUTION ON STRATEGY
Consistent with our strategy, we have executed on the following during 2018:
Capital Allocation
Our key capital allocation activities in 2018 included the following:

• | $133 million declared in dividends to stockholders; and


• | $130 million for growth investments, including $16 million for business development in the UK, $13 million in preparation for services to be provided to a second marine transfer station under our New York City transportation and disposal contract, $50 million for acquisitions, and $24 million for various organic growth investments, which included metals recovery projects, ash processing technology and investments related to our profiled waste and environmental services businesses.

New Business Development
GIG Joint Venture
In December 2017, we entered into an arrangement with GIG, a subsidiary of Macquarie Group Limited, to develop, fund and own EfW projects in the UK and Ireland. This arrangement between Covanta and GIG creates a platform to develop waste infrastructure projects and pursue new opportunities for EfW project development or acquisitions on a 50/50 basis. In February 2018, GIG invested in our Dublin EfW facility, acquiring 50% ownership for €136 million, while we retained a 50% equity interest, through a joint venture, and retained our role as operations and maintenance ("O&M") service provider for the facility. As additional projects in the development pipeline reach financial close and move into the construction phase, we and GIG will acquire the available ownership in each project, with a premium payable to the partner that originally developed and/or contributed the project. We are the preferred O&M service provider for all projects where we co-invest with GIG, on market competitive terms.
In December 2018, financial close was reached on a second project, the Earls Gate Energy Centre project ("Earls Gate"), an EfW facility to be constructed in Grangemouth, Scotland. Covanta and GIG together will hold a 50% equity ownership with co-investor and developer Brockwell Energy owning the remaining 50% stake. The Earls Gate facility is expected to commence operations in late 2021.
Other Business Development
During the first quarter of 2018, we acquired one environmental services business located in Toronto, Canada for approximately $4 million, expanding the capabilities and client service offerings of our CES business in Canada.
In March 2018, we received notice to proceed from the Department of Sanitation of New York City ("DSNY") to develop the infrastructure supporting the East 91st Street Marine Transfer Station ("MTS"). We expect to commence operations in the second quarter of 2019. The MTS is the second in a pair of marine transfer stations under a 20-year waste transport and disposal agreement between Covanta and DSNY.
In September 2018, we acquired the Palm Beach Resource Recovery Corporation ("PBRRC") for $46 million. PBRRC holds long-term contracts for the operation and maintenance of two EfW facilities located in Palm Beach County, Florida.
In January 2019, we commenced construction of our first Total Ash Processing System located in Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania, adjacent to our metal processing facility. This technology separates the combined ash from EfW facilities into its component parts enabling increased recycling of small metal fractions and the recovery of aggregate for reuse as construction material while reducing the volume of ash requiring landfill disposal. Operational start-up is expected in the second half of 2019. 
Contract Extensions
We reached agreements to extend several material contracts in 2018, including:

• | Service fee operating contract at our Huntington facility for an additional 5 years through 2024;


• | Service fee operating contract at our Huntsville facility for an additional 5 years through 2023;


• | Service fee operating contract at our Montgomery County facility for an additional 5 years through 2026; and


• | Power purchase agreement at our Marion County facility for an additional 15 years through 2034.

Other Significant Events
During 2018, we commenced a fleet optimization program with the goals of improving overall operating profit and cash flow from our portfolio, reducing risk, and focusing resources on our most profitable and strategically important businesses. We identified a population of EfW facilities where local market conditions, operating and maintenance costs, and other factors challenge facility economics, and we began exploring strategic alternatives for these assets, which may include contract renegotiation, sale, or facility closure. We anticipate that this program will continue over the next several years. The following activities occurred during 2018 as part of this effort:

• | During the second quarter of 2018, we made a decision to cease operations at our EfW facility in Warren County, New Jersey due to ongoing challenges with the economic performance of the facility. The shutdown is expected to occur in mid-2019. For further information see in Item 8. Financial Statements And Supplementary Data —Note 10. Supplementary Information. 


• | In July 2018, we sold our equity interests in a hydroelectric facility located in the state of Washington for proceeds of approximately $12 million. For further information see in Item 8. Financial Statements And Supplementary Data —Note 4. Dispositions and Assets Held for Sale.


• | In September 2018, we amended our service agreement with the City of Long Beach, California. Under the amendment, the City of Long Beach will invest approximately $9 million and we will invest an additional $5 million for facility maintenance which will allow for opportunities to process higher-value waste. These capital investments aim to ensure continued sustainable operation of the facility.

In March of 2018, our service contract with Hennepin County to operate the Hennepin Energy Recovery Center expired.
Continuous Improvement 
In 2018, we advanced our continuous improvement initiative utilizing Lean Six Sigma methodologies.  The focus of this data-driven effort is on achieving stable operations at high performance levels, improved process efficiency and standardization across all of our facilities.  We have established a team that includes external experts and internal top performers.  This effort advances beyond previous efficiency initiatives, and enhances and complements the outage optimization efforts that we have undertaken over the past several years.
Sustainability Goals 
We continued to advance our performance against a series of sustainability goals aligned with our business goals and mission. Set in the areas of safety and health, environment, materials management, human resources, finance, governance, and community affairs, each goal has an assigned champion on our senior leadership team to ensure their full integration into our business. We believe attaining these goals helps us respond to our customers’ increasing interest in sustainability and the sustainable solutions we provide, mitigate certain risks, and gain a competitive advantage in business development opportunities. 
ENERGY-FROM-WASTE-PROJECTS
Our EfW projects generate revenue primarily from three sources: (1) fees charged for operating facilities or processing waste received; (2) the sale of electricity and/or steam; and (3) the sale of ferrous and non-ferrous metals that are recovered from the waste stream as part of the EfW process. We may also generate additional revenue from the construction, expansion or upgrade of a facility, when a public sector client owns the facility. Our customers for waste services or facility operations are principally public sector entities, though we also market disposal capacity at certain facilities to commercial customers. Our facilities primarily sell electricity, either to utilities at contracted rates or, in situations where a contract is not in place, at prevailing market rates in regional markets (primarily PJM, NEPOOL and NYISO in the Northeastern United States), and in some cases sell steam directly to industrial users.
We also operate and/or have ownership positions in environmental services businesses, transfer stations, and landfills (primarily for ash disposal) that are ancillary and complementary to our EfW projects and generate additional revenue from disposal or service fees.
8

EfW Contract Structures
Most of our EfW projects were developed and structured contractually as part of competitive procurement processes conducted by public sector entities. As a result, many of these projects have common features. However, each contractual agreement is different, reflecting the specific needs and concerns of a client community, applicable regulatory requirements and/or other factors.
Our EfW projects can generally be divided into three categories, based on the applicable contract structure at a project as described in the table below. Notwithstanding distinctions among these general classifications in contract structures, in all cases we focus on a consistent set of performance indicators to optimize service to customers and operating results:(i) boiler availability; (ii) turbine availability; (iii) safety and environmental performance measures; (iv) tons processed; (v) steam sold; (vi) megawatt hours sold; and (vii) recycled metal tons sold. 
The following summarizes the typical contractual and economic characteristics of the three project structures our EfW projects located in North America:

 | Tip Fee | Service Fee(Covanta Owned) | Service Fee(Client Owned) 
Number of facilities: | 20 | 4 | 18 
Client(s): | Host community and municipal and commercial waste customers | Host community, with limited merchant capacity in some cases | Dedicated to host community exclusively 
Waste or servicerevenue: | Per ton “tipping fee” | Fixed fee, with performance incentives and inflation escalation 
Energy revenue: | Covanta retains 100% | Share with client(Covanta retains approximately 20% on average) 
Metals revenue: | Covanta retains 100% | Share with client(Covanta typically retains approximately 50%) 
Operating costs: | Covanta responsible for all operating costs | Pass through certain costs to client(e.g. ash disposal) 
Project debt service: | Covanta project subsidiary responsible | Paid by client explicitly as part of service fee | Client responsible for debt service 
After service contractexpiration: | N/A | Covanta owns the facility; clients have certain rights set forth in contracts; facility converts to Tip Fee or remains Service Fee with new terms | Client owns the facility; extend with Covanta or tender for new contract

We are principally responsible for capital costs in facilities that we own; however, client communities may have a contractual obligation to fund a portion of certain capital costs, particularly if required by a change in law. We also may be required to participate in capital improvements for non-owned facilities that we operate, which would be accounted for as operating expense. In contracts with our client communities, we agree to operate the facility and meet minimum performance standards. Typically, these include waste processing, energy efficiency standards, energy production and environmental standards. Unexcused failure to meet these requirements or satisfy the other material terms of our agreement, may result in damages charged to us or, if the breach is substantial, continuing and unremedied, termination of the applicable agreement. If one or more contracts were terminated for our default, these contractual damages may be material to our cash flow and financial condition. To date, we have not incurred material liabilities under such performance guarantees.
Contracted and Merchant Revenue
We generated 75% of our waste and service revenue in 2018 under contracts at set rates, while 25% was generated at prevailing market prices. Our waste disposal / service contracts expire at various times between 2019 and 2038. As of December 31, 2018, the volume weighted average contract life of our service fee contracts and tip fee contracts is 9.4 and 5.3 years, respectively. Our energy contracts expire at various times between 2019 and 2034. As our contracts expire, we become subject to greater market risk in maintaining and enhancing our revenue. To date, we have been successful in extending the majority of our existing contracts to operate EfW facilities owned by public sector clients. We project the percentage of 2019 contracted waste and service revenue to approximate 2018 levels. 
As our waste service agreements at facilities that we control expire, we intend to seek replacement or additional contracts, and because project debt on these facilities will be paid off at such time, we expect to be able to offer rates that will attract sufficient quantities of waste while providing acceptable revenue to us. The expiration of existing energy contracts at these facilities will require us to sell our output either into the local electricity grid at prevailing rates or pursuant to new contracts. We expect that multi-year contracts for waste supply at these facilities will continue to be available on acceptable terms in the marketplace, at 
9

least for a substantial portion of facility capacity, as municipalities continue to value long-term committed and sustainable waste disposal capacity. We also expect that an increasing portion of system capacity will be contracted on a shorter-term basis, and so we will have more frequent exposure to waste market risk. We expect that multi-year contracts for energy sales will generally be less available than in the past, thereby increasing our exposure to energy market prices upon expiration. As our existing contracts have expired and our exposure to market energy prices has increased, we entered into hedging arrangements in order to mitigate our exposure to near-term (one to three years) revenue fluctuations in energy markets, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Our efforts in this regard will involve only mitigation of price volatility for the energy we produce in order to limit our energy revenue "at risk," and will not involve speculative energy trading.
See Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our results of operations may be adversely affected by market conditions existing at the time our contracts expire. Over time, we will seek to renew, extend or sign new waste and service contracts and pursue opportunities with commercial customers and municipalities that are not necessarily stakeholders in our facilities in order to maintain a significant majority of our waste and service revenue (and EfW fuel supply) under multi-year contracts. 
In addition, we are focused on expanding our environmental service offerings through both organic growth and acquisitions. The acquisitions will allow us to establish a greater presence in the environmental services sector, expand the geographical sourcing of our waste streams and drive non-hazardous profiled waste volumes into our EfW facilities.  These acquired businesses typically accept waste under short-term contractual arrangements.

MARKETS, COMPETITION AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS
Waste Services 
Post-recycled municipal solid waste generation in the United States is approximately 250 million tons per year, of which the EfW industry processes approximately 12% (of which we process approximately three-quarters).
EfW is an important part of the waste management infrastructure of the United States, particularly in regions with high population density but limited availability of land for landfilling, with 75 facilities currently in operation that collectively process approximately 29 million tons of post-recycled solid waste and serve the needs of over 30 million people and produce enough electricity for the equivalent of 1.3 million homes. The use of EfW is even more prevalent in Western Europe and many countries in Asia, such as Japan. China has doubled its EfW capacity over the past five years and plans to further expand capacity through 2020. Over 1,200 EfW facilities are in use today around the world, with a capacity to process approximately 260 million tons of waste per year. In the waste management hierarchies of the United States EPA and the European Union (“EU”), EfW is designated as a superior solution to landfilling. 
12

Renewable Energy 
Public policy in the United States, at both the state and national levels, has developed over the past several years in support of increased generation of renewable energy as a means of combating the potential effects of climate change, as well as increasing domestic energy security. Today in the United States, approximately 17% of electricity is generated from renewable sources, approximately half of which is hydroelectric power. 
EfW is designated as renewable energy in 31 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, as well as in several federal statutes and policies. Unlike most other renewable resources, EfW generation can serve base-load demand and is more often located near population centers where demand is greatest, minimizing the need for expensive incremental transmission infrastructure.
General Business Conditions
Economic - Changes in the economy affect the demand for goods and services generally, which affects overall volumes of waste requiring management and the pricing at which we can attract waste to fill available capacity. We receive the majority of our revenue under short- and long-term contracts, which limits our exposure to price volatility, but with adjustments intended to reflect changes in our costs. Where our revenue is received under other arrangements and depending upon the revenue source, we have varying amounts of exposure to price volatility.
The largest component of our revenue is waste revenue, which has generally been subject to less price volatility than our revenue derived from the sale of energy and metals. Waste markets tend to be affected, both with respect to volume and price, by local and regional economic activity, as well as state and local waste management policies. 
At the same time, United States natural gas market prices influence electricity and steam pricing in regions where we operate, and thus affect our revenue for the portion of the energy we sell that is not under fixed-price contracts. Energy markets tend to be affected by regional supply and demand, as well as national economic activity and regulations. 
The following are various published pricing indices relating to the US economic drivers that are relevant to those aspects of our business where we have market exposure; however, there is not a precise correlation between our results and changes in these metrics.

Seasonal - Our quarterly operating income within the same fiscal year typically differs substantially due to seasonal factors, primarily as a result of the timing of scheduled plant maintenance. We conduct scheduled maintenance periodically each year, which requires that individual boiler and/or turbine units temporarily cease operations. During these scheduled maintenance periods, we incur material repair and maintenance expense and receive less revenue until the boiler and/or turbine units resume operations. This scheduled maintenance usually occurs during periods of off-peak electric demand and/or lower waste volumes, which can vary regionally. The scheduled maintenance period in the first half of the year (primarily first quarter and early second quarter) is typically the most extensive, while the third quarter scheduled maintenance period is the least extensive. Given these factors, we normally experience our lowest operating income from our projects during the first half of each year.
Our operating income may also be affected by seasonal weather extremes during summers and winters. Increased demand for electricity and natural gas during unusually hot or cold periods may affect certain operating expense and may trigger material price increases for a portion of the electricity and steam we sell. 
13

Performance - Our EfW facilities have historically demonstrated consistent reliability; our average boiler availability was 91.2% in 2018. We have historically met our operating obligations without experiencing material unexpected service interruptions or incurring material increases in costs. In addition, with respect to many of our contracts, we generally have limited exposure for risks not within our control. Across our fleet of facilities, we operate and maintain a large number of combustion units, turbine generators, and air-cooled condensers, among other systems. On an ongoing basis, we assess the effectiveness of our preventative maintenance programs, and implement adjustments to those programs in order to improve facility safety, reliability and performance. These assessments are tailored to each facility's particular technologies, age, historical performance and other factors. As our facilities age, we expect that the scope of work required to maintain our portfolio of facilities will increase in order to replace or extend the useful life of facility components and to ensure that historical levels of safe, reliable performance continue. For additional information about such risks and damages that we may owe for unexcused operating performance failures, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operation of our businesses involves significant risks, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations. In monitoring and assessing the ongoing operating and financial performance of our businesses, we focus on certain key factors: tons of waste processed, electricity and steam sold, boiler availability, plant operating expense and safety and environmental performance.
Waste, Energy and Metals Markets - We compete in waste markets that are highly competitive. In the United States, the market for waste management is almost entirely price-driven and is greatly influenced by economic factors within regional waste markets. These factors include:

• | regional population and overall waste production rates;


• | the number of waste disposal sites (including principally landfills, other EfW facilities and transfer stations) in existence or in the planning or permitting process;


• | the available disposal capacity (in terms of tons of waste per day) that can be offered by other regional disposal sites;


• | the extent to which local governments seek to control transportation and/or disposal of waste within their jurisdictions;


• | the extent to which local governments and businesses continue to value sustainable approaches to handling of wastes; and


• | the availability and cost of transportation options (e.g., rail, inter-modal, trucking) to provide access to more distant disposal sites, thereby affecting the size of the waste market itself.

Waste service providers seek to obtain waste supplies for their facilities by competing on price (usually on a per-ton basis) with other service providers. At our facilities, where a service fee structure exists, we typically do not compete in this market because we do not have the contractual right to solicit merchant waste. At these facilities, the client community is responsible for obtaining the waste, if necessary by competing on price to obtain the tons of waste it has contractually promised to deliver to us. At our EfW facilities governed by tip fee structures and our waste procurement services businesses, we are responsible for obtaining waste supply, and therefore, actively compete in these markets to enter into spot, medium- and long-term contracts. These EfW projects are generally in densely-populated areas, with high waste generation rates and numerous large and small participants in the regional market. Our waste operations are largely concentrated in the northeastern United States. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our waste operations are concentrated in one region and expose us to regional economic or market declines for additional information concerning this geographic concentration. Certain of our competitors in these markets are vertically-integrated waste companies, which include waste collection operations, and thus have the ability to control supplies of waste, which may restrict our ability to offer services at attractive prices. Our business does not include traditional waste collection operations.
If a long-term contract expires and is not renewed or extended by a client community, our percentage of contracted processing capacity will decrease and we will need to compete in the regional market for waste supply at the facilities we own, from both municipal and commercial services. At that point, we will compete on price with landfills, transfer stations, other EfW facilities and other waste technologies that are then offering disposal or other services in the region. 
Our sustainable service offerings seek to respond to increasing customer demand for environmentally preferred waste handling and disposal, as well as specific business risk mitigation requirements for certain materials. For these services, we compete with many large and small companies offering these services, in local and regional waste markets that are similarly influenced by the factors noted above which affect the broader waste markets.
We currently sell a portion of our electricity and other energy product output pursuant to contracts, and for this portion of our energy output we do not compete on price. As these contracts expire, we will sell an increasing portion of our energy output into competitive energy markets or pursuant to short-term contracts and, as such, generally expect to have a growing exposure to energy market price volatility. 
We have entered into hedging arrangements in order to mitigate our exposure to this volatility, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Our efforts in this regard will involve only mitigation of price volatility for the energy we produce and will not involve speculative energy trading.
14

For the portion of our portfolio that is exposed to electricity markets, we expect prices will be driven by several factors including natural gas supply/demand conditions, regional electricity supply/demand factors, regional transmission and natural gas supply capacity and system conditions, weather conditions, and emerging environmental regulations. All of these factors will have national and regional impacts that affect electricity and steam prices. 
Electricity and steam prices in the markets where the majority of our facilities are located are heavily impacted by movements in natural gas prices. The substantial increase in unconventional or shale gas supply has created downward pressure on gas prices relative to historical levels and therefore on prices for the electricity we sell that is not under contract. However, when demand for gas is high during certain seasons or weather conditions, the gas pipeline system has been limited in its ability to transport enough gas to certain regions, such as New England and California. As result, gas prices can experience short-term spikes, and electricity prices follow. 
Several long-term trends are expected to affect US natural gas prices; including shale gas production, storage capacity, liquefied natural gas exports, regulation, coal plant retirements, as well as industrial, transportation and residential demand. Furthermore, regional natural gas prices, especially in the Northeast are expected to be affected by changes in regional production and transportation capacity. 
We generally enter into short-term contracts for sales of recovered ferrous and non-ferrous metals with processors and end-users (i.e., mills). We compete with other suppliers who are generally not in the EfW industry and whose product may be less costly to process than metals from EfW sources. Recycled metal prices for both ferrous and non-ferrous materials are impacted directly and indirectly by tariff and trade actions by the US and other countries. Recent efforts by the US government to place tariffs on imported steel and aluminum have increased domestic demand for our ferrous products. The ultimate impact of these tariffs is unclear, as retaliation to these tariffs by foreign counties could reduce or eliminate any benefits to us.
Markets for New Project Development - Market conditions for new EfW project development are generally more favorable in select International markets, such as the UK, as compared to the United States. This is due to a variety of factors which exist in these markets including higher prevailing market tip fees and/or energy revenues, the absence of available land for alternative disposal techniques (i.e., landfilling), and regulatory policy support which favors technologies such as EfW. Therefore, our ongoing EfW project development initiatives are generally outside of the United States. We have and expect to continue to pursue opportunities for project development in the United States, such as facilities for metals, ash processing and recycling, in order to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of our EfW operations.
Brexit Implications - In March, 2017, the UK notified the EU of its intention to leave the EU (so-called “Brexit”).  The parties negotiated a proposed agreement covering rights and obligations during a transition period and future relations between the UK on a range of issues, however, the proposed agreement was rejected by Britain's Parliament and the parties are considering next steps. We have studied and consulted with local experts regarding the potential market and economic impacts of Brexit on the UK, with a particular focus on potential impacts to the waste and energy markets as they might affect our plans to expand our business with GIG. (For further information see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3. New Business and Asset Management - Green Investment Group Limited (“GIG”) Joint Venture).  The government of the UK has shown no indication of an intention to rollback or reverse its policy support for environmental protection generally, the renewables market, or for EfW specifically. As such, while Brexit may have some impact on construction costs for new UK EfW projects, we do not believe Brexit, if it occurs, will materially impact the key market and economic drivers for investment in the combined pipeline of EfW projects we are pursuing jointly with GIG. 
Technology, Research and Development
In our EfW business, we own and/or operate EfW facilities that utilize various technologies from several different vendors, including mass-burn combustion technologies and refuse-derived fuel technologies which include pre-combustion waste processing not required with a mass-burn design. As we continue our efforts to develop and/or acquire additional EfW projects internationally, we will consider mass-burn combustion and other technologies that best fit the needs of the local environment of a particular project. 
In addition, we will continue to consider technologies better suited than mass-burn combustion for smaller scale applications, including gasification technologies. 
15

We believe that all forms of EfW technologies offer an environmentally superior solution to post-recycled waste management and energy challenges faced by leaders around the world, and that our efforts to expand our business will be enhanced by the development of additional technologies in such fields as emission controls, residue disposal, alternative waste treatment processes, gasification, and combustion controls. We have advanced our research and development efforts in these areas and have developed new and cost-effective technologies that represented major advances in controlling NOx emissions. These technologies, for which patents have been granted, have been tested at existing facilities and we are now operating and/or installing such systems at a number of our facilities. We intend to maintain a focus on research and development of technologies in these and other areas that we believe will enhance our competitive position, and offer new technical solutions to waste and energy problems that augment and complement our business.
A number of other companies are similarly engaged in new technology development focused on extracting energy from waste materials through a variety of technical approaches, including: gasification, pyrolysis or other combustion designs; converting waste to fuels or other commodities; or processing waste to enable co-firing in larger power plants or industrial boilers.  Firms engaged in these activities generally are less well-capitalized than Covanta, although some engage in joint ventures with larger and well-capitalized companies. To date, we believe such efforts have not produced technologies that offer economically attractive alternatives in the absence of policy support. 
REGULATION OF BUSINESS
Regulations Affecting Our Business
Environmental Regulations — General
Our business activities in the United States are extensively regulated pursuant to federal, state and local environmental laws. Federal laws, such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, and their state counterparts, govern discharges of pollutants to air and water. Other federal, state and local laws comprehensively govern the generation, transportation, storage, treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and also regulate the storage and handling of chemicals and petroleum products (such laws and regulations are referred to collectively as the “Environmental Regulatory Laws”).
Other federal, state and local laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as “CERCLA” and collectively referred to with such other laws as the “Environmental Remediation Laws”) make us potentially liable on a joint and several basis for any on site or off site environmental contamination which may be associated with our activities and the activities at our sites. These include landfills we have owned, operated or leased, or at which there has been disposal of residue or other waste generated, handled or processed by our facilities. Some state and local laws also impose liabilities for injury to persons or property caused by site contamination. Some service agreements provide us with indemnification from certain liabilities.
The Environmental Regulatory Laws prohibit disposal of regulated hazardous waste at our municipal solid waste facilities. The service agreements recognize the potential for inadvertent and improper deliveries of hazardous waste and specify procedures for dealing with hazardous waste that is delivered to a facility. Under some service agreements, we are responsible for some costs related to hazardous waste deliveries. We have not incurred material hazardous waste disposal costs to date.
The Environmental Regulatory Laws also require that many permits be obtained before the commencement of construction and operation of any waste or renewable energy project, and further require that permits be maintained throughout the operating life of the facility. We can provide no assurance that all required permits will be issued or re-issued, and the process of obtaining such permits can often cause lengthy delays, including delays caused by third-party appeals challenging permit issuance. Our failure to meet conditions of these permits or of the Environmental Regulatory Laws can subject us to regulatory enforcement actions by the appropriate governmental authority, which could include fines, penalties, damages or other sanctions, such as orders requiring certain remedial actions or limiting or prohibiting operation. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — Compliance with environmental laws, including changes to such laws, could adversely affect our results of operations. To date, we have not incurred material penalties, been required to incur material capital costs or additional expense, or been subjected to material restrictions on our operations as a result of violations of Environmental Regulatory Laws or permit requirements.
While we believe that we are in compliance with existing Environmental Regulatory and Remediation Laws, we may be identified, along with other entities, as being among parties potentially responsible for contribution to costs associated with the correction and remediation of environmental conditions at disposal sites subject to CERCLA and/or analogous state Environmental Remediation Laws. Our ultimate liability in connection with such environmental claims will depend on many factors, including our volumetric share of waste, the total cost of remediation, and the financial viability of other companies that have also sent waste to a given site and, in the case of divested operations, our contractual arrangement with the purchaser of such operations.
16

The Environmental Regulatory Laws may change. New technology may be required or stricter standards may be established for the control of discharges of air or water pollutants, for storage and handling of petroleum products or chemicals, or for solid or hazardous waste or ash handling and disposal. Thus, as new technology is developed and proven, we may be required to incorporate it into new facilities or make major modifications to existing facilities. This new technology may be more expensive than the technology we use currently.
Environmental Regulations — Recent Developments
Domestic
Maximum Achievable Control Technology ("MACT") Rules — EPA is authorized under the Clean Air Act to issue rules periodically which tighten air emission requirements to achievable standards, as determined under a specified regulatory framework. EPA is required to establish these MACT rules for a variety of industries, including new and existing municipal waste combustion (“MWC”) units, industrial boilers and solid waste incinerators. All of our facilities comply with all applicable MACT rules currently in effect. 
EPA is currently conducting a combined Risk and Technology Review for the large MWC source category and will subsequently propose revised MWC MACT rules. While the scope of and timing for implementation of these rules is uncertain, the revised MWC MACT may lower existing MWC MACT emission limits for most, if not all, regulated air pollutants emitted by our facilities, and may require capital improvements and/or increased operating costs. We are unable at this time, to estimate the magnitude of such costs, which may be material, or to determine the potential impact on the profitability of our MWC facilities.
In some cases, the costs incurred to meet the revised MACT rules at facilities may be recovered from public sector clients and other users of our facilities through increased fees permitted to be charged under applicable contracts; however, to the extent we incur costs at other of our facilities to meet the applicable MACT rules, such costs are not subject to contractual recovery and instead will be borne directly by the affected facilities. 
Revised Ground Level Ozone Standards — On October 26, 2015, EPA published a final rule to revise and strengthen the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ground-level ozone or “smog”. If implemented as published by EPA and affected states, this rule could impact changes to our existing air permits that we may pursue in the future. 
International
Implementation of a revised Best Available Techniques Reference Document for Waste Incineration (BREF) — In the EU, legislation affects our business primarily in the form of “Directives” which are binding on member states and which are implemented through national enabling legislation. The EU is currently finalizing an Industrial Emissions Directive (the so-called “BREF Directive”) which will affect emissions from large industrial installations, including EfW facilities. Once finalized, this will impact future permitting of new facilities or expansions of existing facilities in member states, as well as other jurisdictions that base their requirements on EU Directives (which would include the UK if it leaves the EU). Based on the final draft proposal, we do not believe that the BREF Directive will have a material adverse effect on the Dublin EfW facility or our ability to execute on our plans to develop EfW projects in the UK. 
Energy Regulation
Our businesses are subject to the provisions of federal, state and local energy laws applicable to the development, ownership and operation of facilities located in the United States. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), among other things, regulates the transmission and the wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce under the authority of the Federal Power Act (“FPA”). In addition, under existing regulations, FERC determines whether an entity owning a generation facility is an Exempt Wholesale Generator (“EWG”), as defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (“PUHCA 2005”). FERC also determines whether a generation facility meets the technical and other criteria of a Qualifying Facility (cogeneration facilities and other facilities making use of non-fossil fuel power sources, such as waste, which meet certain size and other applicable requirements, referred to as “QFs”), under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended (“PURPA”). Each of our United States generating facilities has either been determined by FERC to qualify as a QF or is otherwise exempt from the relevant regulations, or the subsidiary owning the facility has been determined to be an EWG.
17

Federal Power Act — The FPA gives FERC exclusive rate-making jurisdiction over the wholesale sale of electricity and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Under the FPA, FERC, with certain exceptions, regulates the owners of facilities used for the wholesale sale of electricity or transmission of electricity in interstate commerce as public utilities. The FPA also gives FERC jurisdiction to review certain transactions and numerous other activities of public utilities. Most of our QFs are currently exempt from FERC’s rate regulation under the FPA because (i) the QF is 20 MW or smaller; (ii) its sales are made pursuant to a state regulatory authority’s implementation of PURPA; (iii) the QF is owned by a municipality or subdivision thereof; or (iv) its sales are made pursuant to a contract executed on or before March 17, 2006. Our QFs that are not exempt, or that lose these exemptions from rate regulation, are or would be required to obtain market-based rate authority from FERC or otherwise make sales pursuant to rates on file with FERC.
Under the FPA, public utilities are required to obtain FERC’s acceptance of their rate schedules for the wholesale sale of electricity. Our generating companies in the United States that are not otherwise exempt from FERC’s rate regulation make sales of electricity pursuant to market-based rates or other rates authorized by FERC. With respect to our generating companies with market-based rate authorization, FERC has the right to suspend, revoke or revise that authority and require our sales of energy to be made on a cost-of-service basis if FERC subsequently determines that we can exercise market power, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, amongst other requirements, our market-based rate sellers are subject to certain market behavior and market manipulation rules and, if any of our subsidiaries were deemed to have violated any one of those rules, such subsidiary could be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of market-based rate authority, as well as criminal and civil penalties. If the market-based rate authority for one (or more) of our subsidiaries was revoked or it was not able to obtain market-based rate authority when necessary, and it was required to sell energy on a cost-of-service basis, it could become subject to the full accounting, record keeping and reporting requirements of FERC. Even where FERC has granted market-based rate authority, FERC may impose various market mitigation measures, including price caps, bidding rules and operating restrictions where it determines that potential market power might exist and that the public interest requires such potential market power to be mitigated. A loss of, or an inability to obtain, market-based rate authority could have a material adverse impact on our business. We can offer no assurance that FERC will not revisit its policies at some future time with the effect of limiting market-based rate authority, regulatory waivers, and blanket authorizations.
Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”), FERC has approved the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or “NERC,” to address the development and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards for the wholesale electric power system. Certain of our subsidiaries are responsible for complying with the standards in the regions in which we operate. NERC also has the ability to assess financial penalties for non-compliance. In addition to complying with NERC requirements, certain of our subsidiaries must comply with the requirements of the regional reliability council for the region in which that entity is located. Compliance with these reliability standards may require significant additional costs, and noncompliance could subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and increased compliance costs.
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 — PUHCA 2005 provides FERC with certain authority over and access to books and records of public utility holding companies not otherwise exempt by virtue of their ownership of EWGs, QFs, and Foreign Utility Companies, as defined in PUHCA 2005. We are a public utility holding company, but because all of our generating facilities have QF status, are otherwise exempt, or are owned through EWGs, we are exempt from the accounting, record retention, and reporting requirements of PUHCA 2005 and FERC’s right to access our books and records is limited in scope.
Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act — PURPA was passed in 1978 in large part to promote increased energy efficiency and development of independent power producers. PURPA created QFs to further both goals, and FERC is primarily charged with administering PURPA as it applies to QFs. FERC has promulgated regulations that exempt QFs from compliance with certain provisions of the FPA, PUHCA 2005, and certain state laws regulating the rates charged by, or the financial and organizational activities of, electric utilities. The exemptions afforded by PURPA to QFs from regulation under the FPA and most aspects of state electric utility regulation are of great importance to us and our competitors in the EfW and independent power industries.
PURPA also initially included a requirement that utilities must buy and sell power to QFs. Among other things, EPAct 2005 eliminated the obligation imposed on utilities to purchase power from QFs at an avoided cost rate where the QF has non-discriminatory access to wholesale energy markets having certain characteristics, including nondiscriminatory transmission and interconnection services. In addition, FERC has established a regulatory presumption that QFs with a capacity greater than 20 MW have non-discriminatory access to wholesale energy markets in most geographic regions in which we operate. As a result, many of our expansion, renewal and development projects must rely on competitive energy markets rather than PURPA’s historic avoided cost rates in establishing and maintaining their viability. 
RTOs and ISOs — Many of our projects operate in or have access to organized energy markets, known as regional transmission organizations, or ("RTOs"), or independent system operators, or ("ISOs"). Each organized market subject to FERC jurisdiction administers centralized energy, capacity and ancillary services markets pursuant to tariffs approved by FERC. These tariffs and 
18

rules prescribe requirements on how the energy, capacity and ancillary service markets operate, how market participants bid, clear, are dispatched, make bilateral sales with one another, and how entities with market-based rates are compensated. Certain of these markets set prices, referred to as Locational Marginal Prices that reflect the value of energy, capacity or certain ancillary services, based upon geographic locations, transmission constraints, and other factors. Each market is subject to market mitigation measures designed to limit the exercise of market power. These market structures may affect the bidding, operation, dispatch and sale of energy, capacity and ancillary services from our projects that rely on competitive energy markets rather than PURPA’s avoided cost rates. 
Policy Debate Regarding Climate Change and Renewable Energy
The public and political debate over GHG emissions (principally CO2 and methane) and their contribution to climate change continues both internationally and domestically. Any resulting regulations could in the future affect our business. As is the case with all combustion, our facilities emit CO2, however EfW is recognized as creating net reductions in GHG emissions and is otherwise environmentally beneficial, because it:
•avoids CO2 emissions from fossil fuel power plants;
•avoids methane emissions from landfills; and
•avoids GHG emissions from mining and processing metal because it recovers and recycles metals from waste.
In addition, EfW facilities are a resilient domestic source of baseload energy, preserve land, and are typically located close to the source of the waste and thus typically reduce fossil fuel consumption and air emissions associated with long-haul transportation of waste to landfills.
For policy makers at the local level who make decisions on sustainable waste management alternatives, we believe that using EfW instead of landfilling will result in significantly lower net GHG emissions, while also introducing more control over the cost of waste management and supply of local electrical power. We are actively engaged in encouraging policy makers at state and federal levels to enact legislation that supports EfW as a superior choice for communities to avoid both the environmental harm caused by landfilling waste, and reduce local reliance on fossil fuels as a source of energy.
Many of these same policy considerations apply equally to other renewable technologies. The extent to which such potential legislation and policy initiatives will affect our business will depend in part on whether EfW and our other renewable technologies are included within the range of clean technologies that could benefit from such legislation.
Several initiatives have been developed at the state or regional levels, and some initiatives exist in regions where we have projects. For example:

• | The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (“RGGI”) is an operating regional “cap-and-trade” program focused on fossil fuel-fired electric generators which does not directly affect EfW facilities. We operate one fossil-fuel fired boiler at our Niagara facility included in the RGGI program.


• | California's Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 ("AB 32"), seeks to reduce GHG emissions in California to 1990 levels by 2020, through an economy-wide “cap-and-trade” program. EfW facilities were exempt from the cap-and-trade program through the end of 2017. Resolutions passed by the Board of the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) direct the agency to provide transition assistance to EfW facilities beginning in 2018. The specific degree of assistance to be provided is uncertain at this time.

International Climate Change Policies
Certain international markets in which we compete have recently adopted regulatory or policy frameworks that encourage EfW projects as important components of GHG emission reduction strategies, as well as waste management planning and practice.
The European Union
Historically, the EU has adopted legislation which requires member states to reduce the utilization of and reliance upon landfill disposal, including (1) Directive 1999/31/EC concerning the landfill of waste (known as the “Landfill Directive”) which imposes operational and technical controls on landfills and restricts, on a reducing scale, the amount of biodegradable municipal waste which member states may dispose of to landfill; and (2) Directive 2008/98/EC on waste (known as the revised “Waste Framework Directive”) which enshrines the waste hierarchy to divert waste from landfill and underpins a preference for efficient energy-from-waste for the recovery of value from residual wastes.
19

In July 2018, the EU finalized its Circular Economy Package (CEP), amending several of the Directives described above to advance a more circular economy. Included within the CEP are the continued preference for efficient energy recovery over landfilling, increased targets for recycling and reuse, and new limits on landfilling.
With respect to the UK and its Brexit plans, we have studied and consulted with local experts regarding the potential regulatory impacts, with a particular focus on potential impacts to the waste and energy markets as they might affect our plans to expand our business with GIG. (For further information see Item 8. Financial Statements And Supplementary Data — Note 3. New Business and Asset Management — Green Investment Group Limited (“GIG”) Joint Venture).  The government of the UK has shown no indication of an intention to rollback or reverse its policy support for environmental protection generally, the renewables market, or for EfW specifically, including with respect to the Directives described above.  As such, while we can provide no assurance, we do not believe Brexit, if it occurs, will materially impact the key regulatory drivers for investment in the combined pipeline of EfW projects we are pursuing jointly with GIG. 

Employee Health and Welfare
We are subject to numerous regulations enacted to protect and promote worker health and welfare through the implementation and enforcement of standards designed to prevent illness, injury and death in the workplace. The primary law relating to employee health and welfare applicable to our business in the United States is the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 ("OSHA"), which establishes certain employer responsibilities including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause illness, death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by OSHA, and assorted reporting and record keeping obligations, as well as disclosure and procedural requirements. Various OSHA standards apply to certain aspects of our operations.
Employee health and welfare laws governing our business in foreign jurisdictions include the Workplace Health and Safety Directive and the Directive concerning ionizing radiation in the EU, and various provisions of the Canada Labour Code and related regulations in Canada. 
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 4,000 full-time employees, the majority of which were employed in the United States. Approximately 7% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various expiration dates through 2021.
