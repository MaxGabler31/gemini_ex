Item 1. Business
 We were incorporated April 24, 2012 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We intend to engage primarily in the development of regenerative medical applications which we intend to license, develop internally or acquire outright from other entities up to the point of successful completion of Phase I and or Phase II clinical trials after which we would either attempt to sell or license those developed applications or, alternatively, advance the application further to Phase III clinical trials. The primary factor to be considered by us in arriving at a decision to advance an application further to Phase III clinical trials would be a greater than anticipated indication of efficacy seen in Phase I trials.

The Company has the following therapies in development:
 HemaXellarate : HemaXellarate is a cellular composition of autologous stromal vascular fraction derived from adipose tissue. HemaXellarate contains endothelial progenitor cells as well as mesenchymal stem cells. Once re-infused into the patient, the patient’s bone marrow is regenerated and begins to function normally.
 dCellVax: dCellVax is comprised of autologous dendritic cells which have been treated with an siRNA inhibitor of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an immunosuppressive enzyme. By inhibiting this enzyme in these dendritic cells, the patient’s cells can now attack cancers, particularly breast cancer.
 tCellVax: Immune cells are removed from the patient, treated with siRNA to inhibit NR2F6 and the cells re-infused to the patient. Now that the inhibitor protein is blocked, the immune system is very activated and kills tumors. siRNA is a double-stranded RNA molecule that is non-coding and is a powerful tool in drug targeting and therapeutics development as it is used to modulate gene expression through transcriptional or translational repression. The NR2F6 nuclear receptor has been identified as a potentially very important immune cell inhibitor (an immune checkpoint) and cancer stem cell differentiator.
 DiffronC: This drug uses our proprietary siRNA in vivo to inhibit cancer growth and activate T cells. The siRNA targets NR2F6. T cells are part of the immune system and develop from stem cells in the bone marrow.
 DuroCAR: DuroCAR is comprised of CAR-T cells which have been treated with an shRNA targeting the gene NR2F6. By inhibiting NR2F6, we expect our DuroCAR cells to have greater efficacy and persistence than conventional CAR-T cells and create a new, optimal way to manufacture CAR-T cells. We are currently in pre-clinical testing of this drug. Chimeric antigen receptor T cells ( CAR-T cells) are T cells that have been genetically engineered to produce an artificial T cell receptor for use in immunotherapy. Chimeric antigen receptors are receptor proteins that have been engineered to give T cells the new ability to target a specific antigen.
 Small molecule: We have identified and patented a series of small molecules which can both activate and inhibit NR2F6. We are currently in pre-clinical testing of these drugs.
 As of September 1, 2022 we have not licensed any existing therapies which may be marketed. On June 23, 2015 Regen Biopharma, Inc. ( “Regen”) entered into an agreement (“Agreement”) with Zander Therapeutics, Inc. ( “Zander”) whereby Regen granted to Zander an exclusive worldwide right and license for the development and commercialization of certain intellectual property controlled by Regen (“ License IP”) for non-human veterinary therapeutic use for a term of fifteen years.

 Principal Products and Services
 dCellVax is intended to be a therapy whereby dendritic cells of the cancer patient are harvested from the body, treated with siRNA that has the ability to block the dendritic cell from expressing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (“IDO”) and subsequently reimplanted in the cancer patient.
 The dendritic cells that are treated with the IDO-blocking RNA become resistant to the influence of tumor cells which produce factors which cause the dendritic cell to express the IDO. Expression of IDO in the dendritic cell halts the dendritic cell from activating T cells and causes the dendritic cell to suppress T cells. T lymphocytes (‘T cells”) are a lymphocyte that play a central role in the human immune system’s attempt to eradicate tumors. The Company has filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to initiate a Phase I/II clinical trial assessing safety with signals of efficacy of the dCellVax gene-silenced dendritic cell immunotherapy for treating breast cancer. The proposed trial will recruit 10 patients with metastatic breast cancer and will involve 4 monthly injections of the dCellVax gene-silenced dendritic cell therapy. The trial is anticipated to last one year, with tumor assessment before therapy and at 6 and 12 months.
 On May 12, 2021 the “Company executed a consulting agreement with Biotech Research Group Corporation, an FDA Specialist Group and Global Regulatory and Scientific Experts, for the purpose of review and guidance with regard to the planned reinstatement of the Company’s inactive Investigational New Drug applications (INDs) #15376 (HemaXellerate) and #16200 (dCellVax) filed with the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The securing of the services to be provided to the Company pursuant to this consulting agreement marks the first step taken by the Company with regard to activating the Company’s currently inactive applications to initiate clinical trials
 HemaXellerate, a cellular therapy designed to heal damaged bone marrow. HemaXellerate is a patient-specific composition of cells that have been demonstrated to repair damaged bone marrow and stimulate production of blood cells based in previous animal studies. The initial application of HemaXellerate will be the treatment of severe aplastic anemia which is characterized by immune-mediated bone marrow hypoplasia (underdevelopment or incomplete development of a tissue) and pancytopenia (reduction in the number of blood cells and platelets).

Adipose tissue is collected from the patient and processed in order to separate, extract and isolate Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF), a mix of various cell types including mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells. Mesenchymal stem cells are connective tissue cells that can differentiate into a variety of cell types and endothelial cells are the cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels and which play a vital role in angiogenesis (the physiological process through which new blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels).
 The isolated SVF is then intravenously administered to the patient. The Company believes that the isolated SVF will generate growth factors with the ability to repair damaged hematopoietic stem cells. Hematopoietic stem cells are immature cells that can develop into all types of blood cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Hematopoietic stem cells are found in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow.
 On February 5, 2013 Regen filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to initiate a Phase I clinical trial assessing HemaXellerate in patients with drug-refractory aplastic anemia. The Phase I clinical trial is intended to determine safety and potential efficacy of intravenously administered autologous SVF cells in patients with severe, immune suppressive refractory aplastic anemia with the primary endpoints of safety and feasibility and secondary endpoints of efficacy as determined by patients having complete response, partial response or relapse.
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a previously unapproved drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven year period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for that time period. The sponsor of the product would also be entitled to a United States federal tax credit equal to 50% of clinical investigation expenses as well as exemptions from certain fees.
 The Company believes that this application of HemaXellerate qualifies for Orphan designation under the Orphan Drug Act due to the fact that aplastic anemia is a rare disease with prevalence in the United States of less than 200,000 and intends to apply to the FDA for Orphan designation for HemaXellerate.
 On December 10, 2015 Regen was informed by the United States Food and Drug Administration that Regen has satisfactorily addressed all clinical hold issues related to Regen’s Investigational New Drug Application for HemaXellerate and may initiate a Phase I clinical trial assessing HemaXellerate in patients with drug-refractory aplastic anemia. The Phase I clinical trial is intended to determine safety and potential efficacy of intravenously administered autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells in patients with severe, immune suppressive refractory aplastic anemia with the primary endpoints of safety and feasibility and secondary endpoints of efficacy as determined by patients having complete response, partial response or relapse.
 tCellVax is intended to be a therapy where immune cells are removed from the cancer patient, treated with siRNA which inhibits NR2F6 and the cells re-infused to the patient. NR2F6 normally acts as a brake on the ability of various immune cells from being activated. The immune cells that are treated with the NR2F6-blocking siRNA become highly activated and can efficiently kill tumors. . The Company has filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to initiate a Phase I clinical trial assessing safety and feasibility of the dCellVax gene-silenced immune cell immunotherapy for treating patients with solid tumors that are metastatic or not able to be removed surgically. The proposed trial will recruit 25 patients with metastatic cancer and will involve 3 monthly injections of the dCellVax gene-silenced dendritic cell therapy. The trial is anticipated to last one year, with tumor assessment before therapy and at 6 and 12 months.

DiffronC: NR2F6 is a transcription factor that is present in many cells in the body, including immune cells but also highly expressed in certain solid tumors. NR2F6 normally acts as a brake on the ability of various immune cells from being activated and also allows tumor cells to keep growing. The Company has developed a proprietary drug that is based on shRNA technology, which prevents NR2F6 from being expressed. By inhibiting the expression of NR2F6, immune cells that are treated with the NR2F6-blocking shRNA become highly activated and can efficiently kill tumors and tumors that have NR2F6 suppressed begin to differentiate. . We are currently in pre-clinical testing of this drug to optimize its delivery in vivo.
 DuroCAR: DuroCAR is a new cellular therapy being developed by the Company. It is comprised of CAR-T cells which have been treated with an shRNA targeting the gene NR2F6. CAR-T cells are T cells (the lymphoid cells of the body that kill tumors) isolated from a cancer patient that have been modified by expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) which is specific for the patient’s tumor. These CAR-T cells are then re-infused back into the patient. The CAR-T cells then home in directly on the tumor because they have been given the tumor-specific address via the CAR. While CAR-T cells are very effective in treating leukemias, they are not effective at treating most solid tumors. The reason for this is believed to be that the CAR-T cells are “turned-off” by the physical environment surround solid tumors. By inhibiting NR2F6, we expect our DuroCAR cells to have greater efficacy and persistence than conventional CAR-T cells and create a new, optimal way to manufacture CAR-T cells. We are currently in pre-clinical testing of this drug.
 Small molecule: We have identified and patented a series of small molecules which can both activate and inhibit NR2F6. NR2F6 normally acts as a brake on the ability of various immune cells from being activated and also allows tumor cells to keep growing. By inhibiting the function of NR2F6 using small molecules, immune cells that are treated with the NR2F6-blocking agents, similar to using the shRNA approach, should become highly activated and efficiently kill tumors. In addition, tumors that have NR2F6 blocked by using these small molecules should begin to differentiate. Conversely, activating NR2F6 is expected to suppress the immune system. This ability to suppress the immune system can be very useful for treating autoimmune disorders. We are currently in pre-clinical testing of these drugs.
 Distribution methods of the products or services:
 It is anticipated that Regen and /or KCL will enter into licensing and/or sublicensing agreements with outside entities in order that Regen and/or KCL may obtain royalty income on the products and services which it may develop and commercialize.
 Need for any government approval of principal products or services, effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business.
 Need for any government approval of principal products or services, effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business.
 The US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and foreign regulatory authorities will regulate our proposed products as drugs or biologics, , depending upon such factors as the use to which the product will be put, the chemical composition, and the interaction of the product on the human body. In the United States, products that are intended to be introduced into the body will generally be regulated as drugs, while tissues and cells intended for transplant into the human body will be generally be regulated as biologics.
 Our domestic human drug and biological products will be subject to rigorous FDA review and approval procedures. After testing in animals, an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) must be filed with the FDA to obtain authorization for human testing. Extensive clinical testing, which is generally done in three phases, must then be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans.
 Phase I
 Phase 1 trials are designed to assess the safety (pharmacovigilance), tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a drug. These trials are often conducted in an inpatient clinic, where the subject can be observed by full-time staff. The subject who receives the drug is usually observed until several half-lives of the drug have passed. Phase I trials normally include dose-ranging, also called dose escalation, studies so that the appropriate dose for therapeutic use can be found. The tested range of doses usually are a fraction of the dose that causes harm in animal testing and involve a small group of healthy volunteers. However, there are some circumstances when real patients are used, such as patients who have end-stage disease and lack other treatment options.

Phase II
 Phase II trials are designed to assess how well the drug or biologic works, as well as to continue Phase I safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers and patients. Phase II trials are performed on larger groups.
 Phase III
 Phase III trials are aimed at being the definitive assessment of how effective the product is in comparison with current best standard treatment and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase III trials may also be conducted for the purposes of (i) "label expansion" (to show the product works for additional types of patients/diseases beyond the original use for which the drug was approved for marketing or (ii) to obtain additional safety data, or to support marketing claims for the product.
 On occasion Phase IV (Post Approval) trials may be required by the FDA. Phase IV trials involve the safety surveillance (pharmacovigilance) and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives permission to be sold.The safety surveillance is designed to detect any rare or long-term adverse effects over a much larger patient population and longer time period than was possible during the Phase I-III clinical trials.
 All phases, must be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans. Each clinical study is conducted under the auspices of an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”). The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution. The time and expense required to perform this clinical testing can far exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create the product. No action can be taken to market any therapeutic product in the United States until an appropriate New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Biologic License Application (“BLA”) or has been approved by the FDA. FDA regulations also restrict the export of therapeutic products for clinical use prior to NDA or BLA approval.
 Even after initial FDA approval has been obtained, further studies may be required to provide additional data on safety or to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those initially targeted. In addition, use of these products during testing and after marketing could reveal side effects that could delay, impede, or prevent FDA marketing approval, resulting in FDA-ordered product recall, or in FDA-imposed limitations on permissible
 The FDA regulates the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products, and human tissue and cell products, requiring that they be produced in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) . The FDA also regulates the content of advertisements used to market pharmaceutical products. Generally, claims made in advertisements concerning the safety and efficacy of a product, or any advantages of a product over another product, must be supported by clinical data filed as part of an NDA or an amendment to an NDA, and statements regarding the use of a product must be consistent with the FDA approved labeling and dosage information for that product.
 Sales of drugs and biologics outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Even if FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The time required to obtain such approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval
