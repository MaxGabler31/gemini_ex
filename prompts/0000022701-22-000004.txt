RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

As previously reported, CSI, Helios Merger Co., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSI (“Merger Sub”), and Pineapple Energy LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Pineapple”), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 1, 2021, as amended (the “merger agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Pineapple, with Pineapple surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSI. The merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are referred to collectively as the “Pineapple Merger Transaction.” 

Following the merger, CSI will be renamed “Pineapple Holdings, Inc.” and is sometimes referred to herein as the “combined company.” Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, Pineapple will complete its acquisition of two Hawaiian solar companies, Hawaii Energy Connection, LLC (“HEC”) and E-Gear, LLC (“E-Gear”), which is sometimes referred to as the “Pre-Closing Acquisition.” Following the closing of the merger, the combined company will be focused on the growing home solar industry, primarily operating through its Pineapple, HEC and E-Gear subsidiary businesses.

At the time the Pineapple Merger Transaction was announced, CSI stated its intention to divest substantially all its current operating and non-operating assets, including its E&S Segment business, its S&S Segment business, real estate holdings, and cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Consistent with that announcement, on August 2, 2021, CSI sold the two subsidiaries that operated the E&S Segment business to Lantronix, Inc. and, as a result, CSI disposed of its E&S Segment business as of that date. See “Sale of E&S Segment” below for additional details. 

A special meeting of CSI shareholders has been scheduled for Wednesday, March 16, 2022, at 10:00 a.m. Central Time to vote on the proposed Pineapple merger transaction, among other things. Beginning on February 4, 2022, the notice of the special meeting and a proxy statement/prospectus was sent to CSI shareholders as of the January 27, 2022 record date.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, the outstanding Pineapple units held by members of Pineapple immediately prior to the effective time will be automatically cancelled and represent only the right to receive shares of CSI common stock. As Base Consideration, CSI has agreed to issue to the members of Pineapple 15.6 million shares of CSI’s common stock. The Base Consideration will be increased for any outstanding convertible notes issued by Pineapple in a pre-closing financing referred to as the Convertible Note Financing, which will convert into additional shares of CSI common stock at a rate of one additional share for every $2.00 in unpaid principal and accrued interest on outstanding convertible notes. The Base Consideration will be decreased for any outstanding indebtedness of Pineapple at the closing of the merger in excess of $22.5 million, which will reduce the Base Consideration at a rate one share for every $2.00 of excess indebtedness. In addition to the Base Consideration, certain members of Pineapple will receive 3.0 million shares of CSI common stock as Earnout Consideration if a funding-related condition to closing the merger is satisfied by Pineapple or waived by CSI and certain Pineapple members may receive up to an additional 10.0 million shares of CSI common stock as Earnout Consideration upon the occurrence of milestones specified in the merger agreement.

In addition, in connection with the Pineapple Merger Transaction, on September 15, 2021, CSI entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain investors, referred to as the PIPE Investors, to make a $32.0 million private placement investment referred to as the PIPE Offering. Under the terms of the securities purchase agreement, for their $32.0 million investment, the PIPE Investors will receive shares of newly authorized CSI Series A convertible preferred stock convertible at a price of $3.40 per share into CSI common stock, together with five-year warrants to purchase an additional $32.0 million of common shares at that same price. The PIPE Offering is expected to close immediately following the consummation of the merger. Thus, the PIPE Investors will invest in the combined company and will not be entitled to any cash dividends prior to the effective time or to the CVRs issued to CSI shareholders as of the close of the business day immediately preceding the effective time. The combined company will use the proceeds from the PIPE Offering to fund the cash portion of the purchase price to acquire Hawaii Energy Connection, LLC and E-Gear, LLC assets, to 

 
repay $4.5 million of Pineapple’s $7.5 million term loan from Hercules, for transaction expenses, and for working capital to support Pineapple’s growth strategy of acquiring leading local and regional solar installers around the United States. It is expected that the Pre-Closing Acquisition, the merger and the PIPE Offering will close sequentially on the same date.

If the merger is approved and the merger is consummated, the shareholders of CSI as of the close of the business day immediately preceding the effective time of the merger will receive one contractual non-transferable contingent value right, or CVR, per share of CSI common stock then held by them. The CVRs will be governed by a CVR agreement by and among CSI, a Rights Agent and a CVR Holders’ Representative. The rights and obligations of the CVR agreement will become the rights and obligations of the combined company after the closing of the merger. Under the CVR agreement, holders of the CVRs will be entitled to receive a portion of the proceeds of any divestiture, assignment or other disposition of all assets of CSI or its subsidiaries that are related to CSI’s pre-merger business, assets and properties that occur during the 24-month period following the closing of the merger.

The foregoing description of the merger and merger agreement, the PIPE Offering and the securities purchase agreement, and the CVR and CVR agreement, do not purport to be complete and are each qualified in their respective entirety by reference to the merger agreement, the securities purchase agreement and the CVR agreement, respectively.

In addition, see Part I – Item 1A – Risk Factors: 

If the merger is approved by CSI shareholders and the merger is consummated, the combined company will be subject to the risks set forth under Item 1A – Risk Factors – “Risks Related to the Combined Company Following Consummation of the Merger.”
If the merger is not approved by CSI shareholders or the merger is not consummated for any other reason, CSI will be subject to the risks set forth under Item 1A – Risk Factors – “Risks Related to CSI Following Termination of the Merger.”
SALE OF SUTTLE BUSINESSS

Suttle, Inc. was a significant component of CSI’s business since 1969. As a key element of the Company’s strategic plan, however, the Company sold substantially all of Suttle’s business, assets and operations pursuant to two separate transactions occurring in 2019 and 2020 that were previously reported. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Discontinued Operations.”

As a result of the Suttle sale, unless otherwise noted, all information in this Form 10-K about Suttle will be discussed and presented as discontinued operations and the Company will report its remaining business operations as continuing operations as described below.

SALE OF E&S SEGMENT

On August 2, 2021, the Company and Lantronix, Inc. (“Lantronix”) completed the sale by CSI to Lantronix of all of the issued and outstanding stock of CSI’s wholly owned subsidiary, Transition Networks, Inc., and the entire issued share capital of its wholly owned subsidiary, Transition Networks Europe Limited (collectively with Transition Networks, Inc., the “TN Companies”), pursuant to a securities purchase agreement dated April 28, 2021 (“E&S Sale Transaction”). See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Discontinued Operations.”

As a result of the E&S Sale Transaction, unless otherwise noted, all information in this Form 10-K about the E&S Segment will be discussed and presented as discontinued operations and the Company will report its remaining business operations as continuing operations as described below.

OVERVIEW OF CURRENT CSI OPERATIONS

Following the E&S Sale Transaction, the Company classifies its business operations into one segment, its Services & Support segment. The Services & Support segment is comprised of CSI’s JDL Technologies, Inc. (“JDL Technologies” or “JDL”) and Ecessa Corporation (“Ecessa”) businesses. JDL is based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Ecessa is based in Minnetonka, Minnesota. Services & Support (“S&S”) provides technology solutions that address prevalent IT challenges, including network resiliency, security products and services, network virtualization, and cloud migrations, IT managed services, wired and wireless network design and implementation, and converged infrastructure configuration, deployment and management. The Services & Support segment includes the business operations of IVDesk, which was purchased in November 2020. Services & Support’s 2021 sales were $7,483,000 compared to 2020 sales of $8,777,000. Project and product revenue totaled $1,168,000 in 2021 or 16% of segment sales compared to $5,120,000 in 2020 or 58% of this segment’s sales. Services revenues increased to $6,315,000 in 2021 from $3,657,000 in 2020.

As noted within this Form 10-K, we have classified the operations of the E&S Segment as discontinued operations for 2021 and 2020. Non-allocated general and administrative expenses are separately accounted for as “Other” in the Company’s segment reporting. 

 
Additionally, any indirect general and administrative costs previously allocated to Suttle and the E&S Segment are also included in “Other.” Intersegment revenues are eliminated upon consolidation. 

Markets and Marketing

Services & Support differentiates itself from its competitors by continuously adopting and adapting to changes in available IT services, ensuring it continues to provide new and innovative solutions to its clients and prospective clients. This ensures this business segment remains well qualified to help clients with their use of technology and IT resources to meet business objectives and regulatory requirements.

Services & Support partners with clients to provide complete support for their information technology environments, from servers to software applications, from the network-level down to the desktop level. Under a typical managed services agreement, S&S provides virtual Chief Information Officer (“CIO”) services to client management, deploys, manages, secures, and supports each client’s IT systems and services, provides helpdesk support to the client’s user community, and adds value to the client’s business by enabling the client to focus instead on its core competencies. Services & Support’s key avenues for delivering on this commitment, and its competitive advantages, include on-premise managed services operations center and secure, state-of-the-art hosted datacenter and partnerships with industry leading solution providers. The managed services operations center leverages the best available tools, applications, practices, and resources to deliver a consistent, quality customer experience. Services & Support holds the MSP Trustmark credential from CompTIATM and is a member of the MSP AllianceTM. 

Services & Support’s portfolio of technology solutions reflects the regular introduction of new technologies and delivery methodologies and the increasing demand among businesses for innovative solutions to strengthen their respective competitive edges and address prevailing IT challenges. With its team of professionally certified engineers, more than 250 years of technical experience, and talented leadership, S&S develops IT solutions that effectively meet these demands. To sustain its leading-edge position, S&S also maintains robust partnerships with strategic manufacturers and is a 3CX VoIP Gold Partner, HP Enterprise Gold Partner, Microsoft Gold Partner, eMDs Solution Provider, and Citrix Silver level Solutions Service Provider. 

Customers

In 2021, Services & Support aggressively targeted its primary vertical markets of healthcare, financial services, commercial business and education.

Healthcare:
Services & Support continues to serve as a trusted partner to its healthcare clients, offering SD-WAN devices and an array of services that address HIPAA Security Rule and Privacy Rule compliance requirements, including its flagship cloud-based service, HIPAA FastTrackTM, which enables healthcare providers to achieve compliance with the complex requirements of the HIPAA. Services & Support’s managed services practice supports clients ranging from single-office providers, to multi-location regional specialists, to their regulated suppliers and business associates.
Financial Services:
Services & Support provides a variety of solutions to the financial services industry. Most notably in the areas of SD-Wan and Network Redundancy which provides a never down network to many local and regional banks and our hosted cloud desktop solution which CPA firms both large and small have adopted to ensure their agents have consistent and secure access to their industry solutions and sensitive client data.
Commercial:
Services & Support provides support and service to a diverse commercial client set. In 2021, Services & Support continued to place emphasis on an expanded set of security solutions layered on top of its Cloud-Based IT Managed Services. This enabled Services & Support to provide an even more secure total solution that included security awareness testing and training of client end users which has become increasingly important as threats to an organization’s security are focused more and more on end users as the weakest link.
Education:
During 2020, Services & Support continued to support a multi-year project to provide wireless network services and datacenter upgrades for several hundred public K-12 schools in Florida. Most of the Company’s work on this project was completed in 2020. The education vertical remains an important element of Services & Support's overall market strategy. Much of the Company’s historical revenue from the education sector has been derived from a school district in Florida. The Company has substantially completed its work on this project and was not selected as the primary vendor on the next multi-year project for this school district but was selected as the secondary vendor for structured cabling and enterprise networking. JDL continued to provide certain data center support services in 2021.
Products and Services

As a managed service provider and value-added reseller, Services & Support specializes in delivering technology solutions that free organizations to focus on the strategic business activities and core competencies critical to their financial success. Services & Support’s technology solutions encompass an extensive range of networking, virtualization, cloud, cybersecurity, and infrastructure services, most of which are available under JDL managed services contracts and a proprietary offering with Ecessa’s SD-WAN device which provides Never Down ® networks. By deploying automatic failover and leveraging up to 25 communication links ranging from MPLS (multiprotocol label switching), lower cost broadband, cable, satellite, microwave or cellular 5G/4G/LTE, Ecessa’s SD-WAN devices guarantee network and Internet uptime. As technology continues its move to the cloud, JDL aggressively markets its portfolio of cloud-based service offerings and SD-WAN devices to healthcare and commercial business. Its HIPAA FastTrackTM and Security FastTrackTM services, available in the JDL Cloud powered by Citrix, have won awards for product innovation, just as Services & Support has been recognized in the industry as a leading Managed Service Provider. Services & Support engineers are trained and certified in the newest cloud and other technology solutions.
Managed Services: 
Services & Support continues to refine its Managed Services offering as the industry matures taking it from a traditional remote management model to a hosted service offering that grants Services & Support greater control, enables tighter service level agreements and increases margins while providing clients with a more service rich, cost effective, and secure environments for their IT systems. Services & Support serves a diverse base of clients with locations throughout the United States, offering managed service programs designed specifically for the healthcare and commercial markets. These robust programs meet HIPAA compliance standards and, while the majority of clients are supported remotely, independent of geographic borders, Services & Support is also able to provide on-site network management and help desk support for key enterprise clients in the South Florida, Atlanta, Georgia, and Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota markets. Services & Support’s managed services include network management, availability assurance, event alerting and incident management services; server, workstation, mobile device, and other asset management services; security services including software patching, firewall, antivirus, anti-malware, and cybersecurity intrusion detection and prevention services; help desk support for client users; SIP-trunking, voice over IP and office management services; migration, conversion and vendor management; and technical consulting services and training. 
Cloud Solutions:
With widespread adoption of cloud solutions on the rise, Services & Support continues to focus on these solutions as key offerings with significant revenue growth potential. Azure® cloud solutions, wireless as a service, infrastructure as a service, and Citrix® as a service (sold as Services & Support FastTrack) are among Services & Support’s most successful cloud offerings, with others including backup, storage, voice over IP, firewall and email as cloud or hosted services. The benefits to clients are numerous and include vertical and horizontal scalability, internal bandwidth conservation, and simplification of IT management within client organizations, while Services & Support benefits from substantial economies of scale and standardization. All Services & Support cloud offerings are billable as monthly recurring revenue under its managed service model, and Services & Support is committed to bringing the benefits of cloud services to all clients.
Network Services: 
Services & Support’s roots are in network services, and these services remain central to its role as a managed service provider and value-added reseller. The Services & Support team has extensive experience and professional certifications in assessing, architecting, designing, and implementing wired and wireless networks as well as entire technology infrastructures. Networking services also include network infrastructure as a service, network design and deployment, network and endpoint security, SD-WAN and SASE offerings, edge security, network optimization, and device installation/configuration services. 
Virtualization:
Whether hosted on premise, in Services & Support’s private cloud, or on third-party platforms such as Azure or Amazon Web Services (“AWS®”), using virtualization across an organization’s IT environment delivers greater agility, mobility and efficiency. Services & Support’s virtualization engineers assess, design, deploy, and manage virtualization programs that are designed to ensure user access to any workload, anytime, anywhere, on any device. Services & Support’s virtualization services encompass network infrastructure, security, desktops, servers, applications, storage, and any combination thereof, including connectivity and software licensing. As Services & Support clients continue to adopt virtualization, they experience the economies of scale, reduced capital requirements, enhanced security, and disaster recovery protections that are inherent in virtualized environments.
Competition

The Company expects the Managed Services market will continue to grow significantly over the next several years, and as a result will attract additional competitors, becoming an even more competitive industry. In response to these factors, Services & Support’s focus is to quickly adapt to the changing needs of its clients through the adoption and productizing of new IT Service technologies as they become available. An example of this was the addition of several security services to the Services & Support portfolio in 2021 including Microsoft 365’s Workforce Modernization which includes a suite of solutions designed to enhance security and flexibility from the workstation to cloud hosted applications. By ensuring Services & Support continuously evaluates the services we offer with a 

 
focus on the changing market, we are able to provide a better range of services to our clients and prospects while increasing their reliance upon us as their IT service provider.

Order Book 

Outstanding customer orders and contracts for Services & Support products and services were approximately $2,800,000 at March 1, 2022 and $4,333,000 at March 1, 2021. The Company does not consider current outstanding orders and contracts as a significant indicator of longer-term future results.
Human Capital

As of March 1, 2022, the Company employed 39 people. Of this number, 31 were employed within the Services & Support segment, and 8 in corporate general and administrative positions. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. None of our employees are currently represented by a labor union.

The Company’s employees are critical to the Company’s ability to execute the strategic direction and transactions approved by the CSI board of directors, including the continued operation of the S&S segment, the Company’s efforts to pursue and consummate the Pineapple Merger Transaction and related transactions, and the Company’s divestiture of substantially all its current operating and non-operating assets as part of CSI’s previously stated intention.

Despite the uncertainties presented by the proposed Pineapple Merger Transaction and related transactions, the Company aims to attract and retain qualified personnel and provides wages and benefits that are competitive locally to reward employees for performance. The Company values innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety and engagement as they attract, develop, and retain the best talent. We have adopted a diversity statement that is posted on our website at https://www.commsystems.com/corporate-governance/communications-systems-inc-diversity-inclusion-statement/.

The health and safety of our employees is a top priority of our leaders.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted temporary office closures, implemented shelter-in-place orders and restrictions and instituted a mandatory work from home policy for substantially all office employees, and instituted social distancing work rules for operations personnel that continued to work in our facilities to satisfy customer orders.  We believe the Company has generally been successful implementing proactive measures to protect the health and safety of its employees while maintaining business continuity and high levels of service to our customers.
