Item 1. Business
Summary
We are a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing differentiated anti-infectives for the hospital and select non-hospital, or community, settings that address the need for effective treatments for infections due to resistant gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. We currently market four antibiotics to treat a variety of infections caused by these resistant bacteria.
Melinta was formed as a private company in October 2000, and operated using funds from licensing and collaboration agreements, private equity placements and debt until 2017. We received approval for our first drug, Baxdela® (delafloxacin), in June 2017. On November 3, 2017, we completed a reverse merger with Cempra, Inc., the result of which the registrant Cempra, Inc. was re-named Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. and we became a publicly-traded company. On January 5, 2018, we acquired the Infectious Disease Businesses (“IDB”) from The Medicines Company (“Medicines”), including the capital stock of certain subsidiaries of Medicines and certain assets related to its infectious disease business (the “IDB Transaction”), including the pharmaceutical products containing (i) meropenem and vaborbactam as the active pharmaceutical ingredient and distributed under the brand name Vabomere® (“Vabomere”), (ii) oritavancin as the active pharmaceutical ingredient and distributed under the brand name Orbactiv® (“Orbactiv”), and (iii) minocycline as the active pharmaceutical ingredient and distributed under the brand name Minocin® for injection and line extensions of such products (the “MDCO Products” and together with Baxdela, the "Products" or the “Product Portfolio”). See “Corporate History and information” below for further information.
We operate and manage our business as one operating segment and all of our operations are in North America. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Market Opportunity
The relentless evolution of bacterial antibiotic resistance, coupled with the dearth of effective new antibiotics, has created an urgent public health threat. The integration of the acquired MDCO Products within our existing portfolio further strengthens our ability to serve the needs of providers treating patients with serious bacterial infections across the healthcare delivery continuum. We believe our combined Product Portfolio, resources and people has created a standalone entity with the ability to help address the significant need for antibiotics to treat serious infections across multiple healthcare channels, while exercising a firm commitment to antibiotic stewardship.
The combined Product Portfolio supports our multi-channel strategy of delivering antibiotics for serious gram-positive and gram-negative infections due to resistant bacteria within the hospital, emergency department, and community settings. We believe that each product has distinct value in the antibiotic marketplace, and that we are uniquely positioned to deliver this value.
Combined Antibiotic Portfolio
Melinta has a pipeline of commercial and clinical antibiotic assets across multiple approved and potential indications, and has a platform for long-term, durable growth and a strategy to expand the anti-infective portfolio over time, providing the opportunity for multiple layers of revenue growth.

Baxdela
Baxdela is a monotherapy treatment of adult patients with acute bacterial skin or skin structure infections (“ABSSSI”) which is available in oral and intravenous (“IV”) formulations. Baxdela is a novel fluoroquinolone that exhibits activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, is unique among quinolones in that it is effective against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureaus (“MRSA”), and is available to initiate therapy on either the IV or oral formulation. In clinical trials, Baxdela demonstrated a differentiated safety and tolerability profile as compared to vancomycin plus aztreonam. On June 19, 2017, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved the use of Baxdela as a treatment of adult patients with ABSSSI. The commercial launch of Baxdela for the adult patient treatment of ABSSSI occurred in the first quarter of 2018.
The FDA also confirmed Baxdela’s status as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (“QIDP”) under the provisions of the 2012 Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now Act (the “GAIN Act”), and extended by five years the five-year exclusivity granted to Baxdela as a new chemical entity (“NCE”), for a total of ten years in the United States. Consequently, and because we believe Baxdela has utility across many different infection types, we conducted a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with community acquired bacterial pneumonia (“CABP”). We believe Baxdela has the potential to address a variety of bacterial infections in the United States. In addition, we have partnered with leading multinational pharmaceutical firms for distribution of Baxdela in markets outside the United States, including with Menarini IFR SrL ("Menarini") for Europe and Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan) and with Eurofarma Laboratórios S.A. for Central and South America. We may obtain additional funds through the achievement of regulatory, commercial and sales-based milestones, as well as royalties on sales of Baxdela outside the United States.
In October 2018, we announced positive top-line results from the Phase III trial of Baxdela for the treatment of CABP. Baxdela was compared to moxifloxacin in this randomized global trial. Baxdela met all key primary and secondary endpoints in the trial, including the study’s primary FDA endpoint showing Early Clinical Response (ECR) with improvement at 96 hours (± 24 hours) after the first dose in at least two of the following symptoms: chest pain, frequency or severity of cough, amount of productive sputum, and difficulty breathing. In the intent-to-treat population (ITT), IV-to-oral Baxdela met the FDA primary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority (12.5% non-inferiority margin) for the Early Clinical Response at 96 hours (± 24 hours) after initiation of therapy (88.9% ECR in Baxdela patients) compared to IV/oral moxifloxacin (89.0%). The 95% confidence interval for the treatment difference had lower and upper bounds of -4.4% and 4.1%, respectively. Baxdela also met the FDA secondary endpoint of statistical non-inferiority (90.5%) compared to moxifloxacin (89.7%) based on the investigator’s assessment of Success at the Test of Cure visit (5-10 days after last dose) in the ITT population. Lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval for the treatment difference were -3.3% and 4.8%, respectively. Data also showed that IV/oral Baxdela successfully eradicated key respiratory pathogens at rates comparable to moxifloxacin. Both intravenous (IV) and oral Baxdela were well tolerated in the study participants. Overall adverse event rates were similar between treatment arms. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events on Baxdela (≥ 2%) were diarrhea and transaminase increases, which were generally mild and did not lead routinely to treatment discontinuation. We anticipate filing a supplemental New 
 3

Drug Approval ("sNDA") with the FDA in the second quarter of 2019 and are developing our commercial plan to address this additional indication.
Vabomere
Vabomere is an IV antibiotic that is a combination of meropenem, the leading carbapenem used in treatment of gram-negative infections, and vaborbactam, a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits certain types of resistance mechanisms used by bacteria. Vabomere received FDA approval on August 29, 2017, for the treatment of patients 18 years of age and older with complicated urinary tract infections (“cUTI”), including pyelonephritis, caused by designated susceptible Enterobacteriaceae, and became commercially available in the fourth quarter of 2017. Vabomere was specifically developed to address gram-negative bacteria that produce beta-lactamase enzymes, particularly the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (“KPC”) enzyme. KPC-producing bacteria are responsible for a large majority of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the United States and are classified by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) to be an urgent antimicrobial resistance threat. With its approval, the FDA also confirmed that Vabomere is eligible for the five-year GAIN Act extension of exclusivity under the provisions of the GAIN Act, though the question of whether Vabomere would be eligible for a five-year NCE exclusivity or three-year exclusivity was referred to the Exclusivity Board of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”). And, in August 2018, we announced that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) granted a new technology add-on payment (NTAP) for Vabomere when administered in the hospital inpatient setting. The NTAP program provides hospitals with a payment, in addition to the standard-of-care Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) reimbursement, of up to 50% of the cost of Vabomere for a period of two to three years, effective in the 2019 fiscal year starting on October 1, 2018. CMS has assigned a maximum payment of $5,544.00 for a Medicare patient treated with Vabomere. Over 80% of Vabomere’s current and projected utilization among all patients is in the hospital inpatient setting.
On November 20, 2018, the European Commission (EC) approved Vabomere for use in adult patients with complicated intra-abdominal (cIAI) and urinary tract infections (cUTI), hospital-acquired pneumonia including ventilator associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP), bacteraemia that occurs in association with any of these infections, and infections due to aerobic gram-negative organisms where treatment options are limited. Marketing authorization was granted in all 28 European Union (EU) member states, as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. We have partnered with Menarini to commercialize Vabomere in Europe and Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan).
We have continued the launch of Vabomere with a sales force that interacts primarily with infectious disease and critical care physicians, microbiologists, and hospital and infectious disease clinical pharmacists. We are leveraging our presence in the hospital setting to promote Vabomere, as well as our other products. 
We believe Melinta is capable of distinguishing Vabomere’s economic value proposition through a pricing strategy that is in line with currently branded therapies used in the treatment of such serious gram-negative infections and designed to facilitate access within the hospital. 
Orbactiv
Orbactiv is a long-acting IV antibiotic of the lipoglycopeptide class that allows for single infusion for the treatment of adult patients with ABSSSI caused or suspected to be caused by susceptible gram-positive bacteria, with no dose adjustment for mild/moderate renal or hepatic impairment or for age, weight, gender, or race. It provides an alternative solution to hospital admission or multiple days of therapy in the outpatient setting. In contrast to the current standard of care (6 to 10 days of IV therapy), single-dose ABSSSI therapy with Orbactiv alternative increases patient convenience, ensures patient adherence with a single dose, and allows for treatment in alternative, lower cost care settings. We are leveraging our hospital and community-based sales force infrastructure to maximize Orbactiv’s potential.
Minocin for injection
Minocin for injection is an IV antibiotic of the tetracycline class with broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. A new formulation was launched in 2015, which improved tolerability and convenience in administration, owing to a smaller required infusion volume. Minocin for injection is one of the few agents approved for treatment of Acinetobacter spp. Acinetobacter infections are generally seen in the intensive care unit (“ICU”), particularly in mechanically ventilated and immunocompromised patients. We are leveraging our hospital-based sales force infrastructure to maximize Minocin for injection’s potential.
Key Business Strategies
We are focused on the commercialization of antibiotics that enable patients with serious, life-threatening bacterial infections to be successfully treated. We plan to carefully evaluate our capital allocation strategy to maximize shareholder value around the recent launches of Baxdela and Vabomere, and the marketing of Orbactiv and Minocin for injection. The critical components of our business strategy are:
 4


1. | Commercial Product Sales Growth


a. | Commercialize Baxdela in the United States. We launched Baxdela oral and IV in the first quarter of 2018 for the treatment of ABSSSI and continue our commercialization of the product with an efficient, targeted sales force consisting of approximately 60 sales territories, prioritizing high-value retail and hospital accounts. In addition, sales representatives target other market channels, such as the emergency department and select community settings, in an attempt to realize the full market potential of Baxdela. We are also pursuing an additional indication, CABP, for which we expect to file an sNDA in the first half of 2019.


b. | Commercialize Vabomere for cUTI in the United States. We market Vabomere in the United States with our combined sales force consisting of approximately 70 sales representatives, prioritizing high-value hospital accounts, focusing on infectious disease and critical care physicians and pharmacists.


c. | Optimize commercialization of Orbactiv and Minocin for injection within the United States. Sales representatives target emergency department and community market channels to realize the full market potential of Orbactiv in the treatment of ABSSSI. In addition, we are leveraging our sales force presence within the hospital to appropriately position Minocin for injection for the treatment of serious infections due to Acinetobacter.


2. | Stewardship of financial resources. We are focused on using the existing sources of cash for the Company, including cash on hand, revenue from product sales and licensing arrangements, and capital available under existing and permitted financing facilities, to achieve future profitability. In order to succeed with this strategy, we must successfully execute sales strategies and reduce operating spend from historical levels. We have an experienced management team and sales force to lead the Company's product sales effort. In addition, we have taken steps to reduce operating expenses, including (a) narrowing the scope of future research and development activities, which involved the natural reduction in costs for large clinical studies that are nearing completion and winding down our early-stage research programs, (b) rationalizing costs in the selling, general and administrative areas, many due to the integration of the legacy Cempra, IDB and Melinta businesses post-merger and acquisition, and (c) negotiation with various third-parties to reduce and/or extend payment for certain large commitments.


3. | Optimize partnerships to maximize the value of the Product Portfolio. We have a number of partnerships, including established partnerships for our Product Portfolio in Europe and Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan) with Menarini, and for Baxdela in Central and South America with Eurofarma Laboratórios S.A. We have a development partnership with a contract research organization (“CRO”) for our pipeline asset, radezolid, which is focused on the topical dermatology space. We plan to evaluate the potential of existing and new business development opportunities to further generate non-dilutive capital and enhance shareholder value.

These partnerships have already seen positive momentum. On November 20, 2018, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Vabomere for use in adult patients with complicated intra-abdominal (cIAI) and urinary tract infections (cUTI), hospital-acquired pneumonia including ventilator associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP), bacteraemia that occurs in association with any of these infections, and infections due to aerobic gram-negative organisms where treatment options are limited. In South America, Eurofarma has received approval to market Baxdela in Argentina and is preparing applications to several other countries.

4. | Leverage the enterprise’s commercial organization to promote complementary internally or externally developed products upon achievement of FDA regulatory approval. With an experienced team and commercial infrastructure in place, we believe we are well positioned to add either internally or externally developed products to our portfolio while adding minimal new costs. We may selectively pursue the addition of externally developed products to our existing marketed products and pipeline, leveraging our commercial infrastructure.

Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies.
In many cases, however, we believe that competition often will be determined by antibiotic class and any limitations of that antibiotic class in general, and the antibiotic specifically, in treating a particular disease or population.  We believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of product candidates that we develop or acquire are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, convenience in dosing, price and reimbursement.
Intellectual Property
Due to the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products to market, biopharmaceutical companies have traditionally placed considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for significant new 
 5

technologies, products and processes. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by Patent Term Adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent. In the United States, and certain other countries, the patent’s term may also be lengthened by patent term extension or restoration, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays in granting a regulatory approval by the FDA, or similar agency in other countries.
While we pursue patent protection and enforcement of all our products and product candidates, and aspects of our technologies when appropriate, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain our competitive position. To protect this competitive position, we regularly enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with third parties, including employees, independent contractors and consultants, suppliers and collaborators. Our employment policy requires each new employee to enter into an agreement containing provisions generally prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of our company and providing that any invention conceived by an employee within the scope of his or her employment duties is our exclusive property. We have a similar policy with respect to independent contractors and consultants, generally requiring independent contractors to enter into agreements containing provisions generally prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of our company and providing that any invention conceived by an independent contractor or consultant within the scope of his or her services is our exclusive property with the exception of contracts with universities and colleges that may be unable to make such assignments. Furthermore, our know-how that is accessed by third parties through collaborations and research and development contracts and through our relationships with scientific consultants is generally protected through confidentiality agreements with the appropriate parties.
Baxdela
We have a license, both exclusive and nonexclusive, from Wakunaga Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd. to certain patents and patent applications, and to certain patents and patent applications of AbbVie. We have also licensed technology from CyDex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (now a wholly owned subsidiary of Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated) for the use of Captisol, a sulfobutylether beta-cyclodextrin excipient, in connection with the manufacture of Baxdela vials. We have developed and patented additional technology independently.  The patent portfolio for Baxdela and delafloxacin meglumine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Baxdela, is related to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, manufacturing methods and methods of use. In addition to the licensed and owned issued U.S. patents, the portfolio includes pending U.S. patent applications and corresponding foreign national or regional counterpart patents or applications. We expect that the patents and the patent applications in the portfolio, if issued, will expire between 2025 and 2034.
Vabomere
As a result of our acquisition of IDB, we acquired a portfolio of patents and patent applications relating to Vabomere, including the vaborbactam compound, Vabomere composition, and methods of use. We are currently prosecuting related patent applications relating to Vabomere’s pharmaceutical composition and its use in the United States and in certain foreign countries.  In addition, patent applications are pending for synthesis intermediates, manufacturing flow processes and additional methods of use, which, if issued, would expire between 2035 and 2038.
Orbactiv
As a result of our acquisition of IDB, we obtained an exclusive license from Eli Lilly to patents relating to Orbactiv, its uses, formulations and methods of manufacture. The earliest-filed patent for Orbactiv that we acquired, which relates to the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Orbactiv, will expire in the United States in November 2020. The Medicines Company also developed and patented additional technology.  We acquired from Medicines U.S. patents relating to methods of treatment expiring in 2029 and 2030, as well as a patent co-owned with AbbVie relating to high purity oritavancin that expires in 2035. Numerous foreign counterparts have been filed, including in Europe and Eurasia, for these more recent methods of treatment and compositions. We are also prosecuting a number of patent applications relating compositions, including oritavancin and a cyclodextrin, and their uses in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, which, if issued, would expire in 2037.
Minocin for injection
As a result of our acquisition of IDB, we acquired a patent portfolio relating to certain minocycline formulations and certain methods of administering minocycline. We have patents relating to the Minocin for injection intravenous composition and certain methods of administering minocycline, each of which is set to expire in May 2031. We are also prosecuting other patent applications relating to minocycline formulations and methods of treatment in the United States and in certain foreign countries.
Collaborations and Commercial Agreements
 6

See Notes 5 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on certain of our collaboration and commercial agreements.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of the products in our product portfolio nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients ("API") and finished products, and we employ internal resources and third-party consultants to manage our manufacturing contractors.
We do not have material long-term contracts for the commercial supply of the Products, except for certain contracts for the production of ingredients of vaborbactum.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States—at the federal, state and local level—and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, and export and import of products such as those we are marketing or developing. All of our approved products are subject to extensive regulation, and our antibiotic product candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States.
Securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United States requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete. The applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the FDA before commencing clinical trials. Clinical trials are conducted to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phases, although the phases may overlap or be combined. If the required clinical testing is successful, the results are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”).
Even if an NDA receives approval, the applicant must comply with post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approval must report adverse reactions, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be included in the NDA, and approved by the FDA. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety or efficacy after commercialization, which may require additional clinical trials or patient registries, or additional work on chemistry, manufacturing and controls. Any post-approval regulatory obligations, and the cost of complying with such obligations, could expand in the future.
The manufacture, sale, promotion and distribution of our products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Government regulation by various national, regional, federal, state and local agencies, both in the United States and other countries, addresses (among other matters) inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-marketing surveillance, record keeping, storage and disposal practices. In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States. We are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user, establishment and other fees.
Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects our business. Among other effects, health care regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products. We expect compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product's production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties.
In addition to regulatory initiatives, our business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products. These studies may result in the discontinuance of, or limitations on, marketing of such products domestically or worldwide, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.
Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies and private organizations in the United States and other countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts 
 7

to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payors and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. We expect insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products. Budgetary pressures in the United States—and in other countries—may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on our products for the foreseeable future.
Specifically, U.S. federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorily-prescribed rebates to state Medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state Medicaid plans, and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates affect our business. Similarly, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as a prerequisite to participation in Medicaid and other federal health care programs, requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies, including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense and Public Health Service entities and institutions. In addition, recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to TRICARE program beneficiaries. The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 also established the 340B drug discount program, which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities.
Most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed. In addition, the federal government follows a diagnosis-related group (“DRG”) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (“PPS”) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Medicare reimburses Part B drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs, which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting. Medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patient-administered medicine delivered under Part D.
Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the “Affordable Care Act”), we pay a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs. The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the United States. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties.
Antibiotic Exclusivity
Under the GAIN Act, upon NDA approval, a drug product designated by FDA as a QIDP receives a five-year extension of any five-year NCE exclusivity, three-year exclusivity, or seven-year orphan drug exclusivity.  This exclusivity applies only with respect to drugs that are first approved on or after July 9, 2012.  An efficacy supplement to an approved NDA is not eligible for the five-year exclusivity extension if the application that is being supplemented has previously received the five-year GAIN exclusivity extension.  A QIDP is defined as an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by (1) an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens, or (2) qualifying pathogens, which are defined as those that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health and that are included in a list established and maintained by FDA.
A drug sponsor may request that the FDA designate its product as a QIDP at any time prior to NDA submission. The FDA must make a QIDP determination within 60 days of receiving the designation request.  The first NDA for a specific drug product and indication for which QIDP designation was granted will automatically be granted priority review.  A subsequent application from the same sponsor for the same product and indication will receive priority review designation only if it otherwise meets the criteria for priority review.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales, manufacturing and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement also vary greatly from country to country. Our primary strategy is to find partners that operate in foreign countries and collaborate with them to seek approval for, and market, our products, generating royalty and licensing revenue.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory 
 8

approval for commercial sale will depend considerably on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our products may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
In 2003, the U.S. government enacted legislation providing a prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. In March 2010, the ACA, as amended, became law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. We anticipate that this legislation will result in additional downward pressure on prescription drug coverage and may affect our ability to set the prices that we receive for any approved product, either directly if legislation mandates discounts or other reductions, or indirectly if limited coverage results in reduced demand. Federal, state and local governments in the United States continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of health care costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing.
Different pricing and reimbursement structures exist in other countries. In the European community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of our particular drug products to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to set their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Corporate History and Information
On November 3, 2017, Cempra, Inc. merged with privately-held Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. in a reverse merger, wherein the former Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. became a subsidiary of Cempra, Inc. and was re-named Melinta Subsidiary Corp.
