ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
OVERVIEW​
TG Therapeutics is a fully-integrated, commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel treatments for B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. In addition to an active research pipeline including five investigational medicines across these therapeutic areas, we have received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for UKONIQ® (umbralisib), for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma who have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based regimen and relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma who have received at least three prior lines of systemic therapies. Currently, we have three programs in Phase 3 development for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) and patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and several investigational medicines in Phase 1 clinical development. We also actively evaluate complementary products, technologies and companies for in-licensing, partnership, acquisition and/or investment opportunities.
​
FDA Accelerated Approval and U.S. Launch of UKONIQ
​
On February 5, 2021, we announced that the FDA granted accelerated approval of umbralisib, now referred to as UKONIQ, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL) who have received at least one prior anti-CD20 based regimen and adult patients with relapsed or refractory Follicular Lymphoma (FL) who have received at least three prior lines of systemic therapy. UKONIQ is the first and only, oral, once daily, inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) delta and casein kinase 1 (CK1) epsilon. Accelerated approval was granted for these indications based on overall response rate (ORR) data from the Phase 2b UNITY-NHL Trial (NCT02793583). Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. 
​
Following FDA approval, we launched UKONIQ, making it available to patients through a distribution network that includes a specialty pharmacy and specialty distributors. Payor coverage of UKONIQ and inclusion in the NCCN guidelines have been consistent with the FDA-approved indications. We are committed to helping patients access their prescription for UKONIQ through the TG Patient Support Program, which we launched following the approval of UKONIQ.
​
Regulatory Developments related to UKONIQ in Combination with Ublituximab (U2) in CLL and UKONIQ in R/R MZL and FL
​
In March 2021, we submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) for ublituximab in combination with UKONIQ for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) based on the results of the UNITY-CLL Phase 3 study. In May 2021, we submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for UKONIQ to add an indication for CLL and SLL in combination with ublituximab. Both the BLA and sNDA for U2 in CLL and SLL were accepted for filing, with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 25, 2022 for both applications.
​
In November 2021, we received notification from the FDA that it planned to host a meeting of the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) in connection with its review of the pending BLA/sNDA for U2 for the treatment of adult patients with CLL and SLL. The FDA’s concern giving rise to the ODAC meeting stems from an early analysis of overall survival from the UNITY-CLL trial, which showed a possible increased risk of death in patients receiving U2 compared to the control arm of obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil. The potential questions and discussion topics for the ODAC include: the benefit-risk of the U2 combination for the treatment of CLL or SLL, including the preliminary OS analysis, rates of serious adverse events, rates of dose discontinuations due to adverse events, and rates of dose modifications from the UNITY-CLL trial, and the benefit-risk of UKONIQ for R/R MZL and FL, each of which has been raised as a concern by the FDA.
​
​

Due to the concerns that prompted the ODAC meeting, the FDA also placed select clinical trials investigating U2 and its components in CLL and NHL, on partial clinical hold in January 2022. Most studies included in the partial clinical hold were already closed to new enrollment or were on had been placed on administrative hold to new enrollment by the Company prior to the time the FDA imposed the partial clinical hold.
​
Registration Directed Clinical Trial Updates:
​
In 2021, we continued to advance our late-stage pipeline in hematology and multiple sclerosis. The below are recent updates from our current registration directed clinical trials. Currently clinical trials enrolling CLL or NHL patients to U2 or its components are on partial clinical hold.
Hematology:

● | UNITY-NHL Phase 2b Trial: UNITY-NHL is a broad, multicenter, open-label, Phase 2b registration-directed clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of UKONIQ monotherapy and UKONIQ plus ublituximab (U2) combinations in patients with previously treated non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In December 2021, TG presented data from the UNITY-NHL trial during the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2021 annual meeting which included updates from the U2 cohort in patients with relapsed or refractory MZL and an update from the U2 plus bendamustine cohort in relapsed or refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | UNITY-CLL Phase 3 Trial Evaluating Umbralisib plus Ublituximab (U2): UNITY-CLL is a global, multi-center, Phase 3, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing the U2 combination to an active control arm of obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in patients with both treatment naive and relapsed or refractory CLL. The primary endpoint for this study is progression free survival (PFS).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The UNITY-CLL trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that U2 significantly improved PFS over obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil (HR=0.54, p<0.0001) as well as ORR (p<0.001) in patients with CLL; with consistent PFS improvement across subgroups, including treatment naïve CLL (HR=0.48) and relapsed/refractory CLL (HR=0.60). These data, as well as additional sub-analyses from the UNITY-CLL trial were presented at major medical meetings in 2021.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ULTRA-V Phase 2/3 Trial Evaluating U2 plus Venetoclax in CLL: The ULTRA-V study is being conducted in two parts. The ULTRA-V Phase 2 trial is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of U2 in combination with venetoclax in subjects with treatment-naïve CLL and relapsed or refractory CLL, while the Phase 3 trial will compare U2 vs U2 plus venetoclax in the same population.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The Phase 2 portion completed enrollment of approximately 165 patients in early 2021. The Phase 3 portion commenced at approximately the same time.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiple Sclerosis: 

● | ULTIMATE I & II Trials Evaluating Single Agent Ublituximab in RMS: ULTIMATE I and ULTIMATE II are two independent Phase 3 trials. Each trial is a global, randomized, multi-center, double-blinded, double-dummy, active-controlled study comparing the efficacy and safety/tolerability of ublituximab (450mg dose administered by one hour intravenous infusion every 6 months, following a Day 1 infusion of 150mg over four hours, and a Day 15 infusion of 450mg over one hour) to teriflunomide (14mg oral tablets taken once daily) in subjects with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In April 2021, data from the ULTIMATE I & II trials were presented for the first time at the American Academy of Neurology Annual meeting. Both studies met their primary endpoint with ublituximab treatment demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in annualized relapse rate (ARR) over a 96-week period
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(p<0.005 in each trial). Key secondary MRI endpoints were also met. Additional data from these trials has been presented at various other medical meetings.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | On December 14, 2021, we announced that the FDA accepted a BLA for ublituximab as a treatment for patients with RMS. The FDA set a PDUFA goal date of September 28, 2022 and notified the Company that it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss this application.

​
Our Approach and Platform
​
Our approach to drug development is centered on developing solutions for patients rather than developing single therapies for a disease. Our process begins by identifying validated targets against B-cell diseases, and then searching for and, ideally, acquiring what we believe to be “best-in-class” compounds with complementary mechanisms against these targets, with the goal of developing multi-drug proprietary targeted combinations, which can potentially offer new treatment options for patients in need.
​
Our preference is to identify targets for which there is human clinical proof of concept that the mechanism is active in B-cell diseases and then to identify drug candidates that effectively modulate the desired molecular target. We identify these drug candidates at academic centers of excellence or in development at biotech companies or pharmaceutical companies globally. Our current drug candidates were acquired through license agreements, collaborations, or joint ventures with biopharmaceutical companies located in the US, France, Switzerland, India, and China. This approach enables us to minimize target risk while looking for the best available drug candidates around the world. By focusing on B-cell diseases and targets with a known activity profile, we believe that we can quickly identify the patients

most likely to respond, resulting in a more efficient development path with the potential for a greater likelihood of success. Importantly, since our drug candidates have complementary mechanisms of action, we can rapidly explore combination therapies, which we believe is essential to improving outcomes for patients and may hold the key to potentially identifying cures for patients with B-cell diseases.
​
Our approach is enabled by our clinical development platform which includes: 
​

● | An internal team with a deep understanding of B-cell diseases and significant experience successfully pioneering innovative treatments for these complex diseases; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A vast external network of more than 350 community and academic clinical trial sites with significant experience researching B-cell diseases.

B-CELL DISEASES OVERVIEW

The constellation of diseases that arise from abnormally growing or behaving B-cells is substantial. One group of diseases related to abnormal B-cell growth is malignant lymphomas, including NHL and CLL. There are over 80 types of NHL, approximately 40 to 50 of which are due to malignant B-cells. These diseases can include some of the slowest and fastest growing cancers known to medicine. Some of the more common B-cell malignancies include MZL, FL, SLL and CLL.
​
The other major group of diseases caused by abnormally functioning B-cells is autoimmune disorders. These diseases may result from inappropriate production of antibodies from the B-cells. These antibodies cannot discriminate “self” from “non-self,” and inadvertently mount a disabling immune response against normal organs. Examples of common and very debilitating autoimmune disorders for which abnormally functioning B-cells have been implicated include MS and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
​The Company’s current clinical programs are focused on MZL, FL, CLL and MS.

Marginal Zone Lymphoma Overview
MZL comprises a group of indolent (slow growing) mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). MZL is generally considered a chronic and incurable disease. MZL is the second most common form of indolent NHL and accounts for approximately 10.6% of all NHL cases. More than 8000 new cases of MZL are expected in the US in 2021, with approximately 6000 patients with R/R MZL on therapy each year. MZL consists of three different subtypes: extranodal MZL of the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL), and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL).
Follicular Lymphoma Overview
FL is typically an indolent form of NHL that arises from B-lymphocytes. It is the most common form of NHL. FL is generally not curable and is considered a chronic disease, as patients can live for many years with this form of lymphoma. FL accounts for approximately 17.1% of all NHL cases. More than 13,000 new cases of FL are expected in the US in 2021, with ~12,500 patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) FL on therapy each year.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Overview
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common type of adult leukemia in the US. It is projected to represent 11% of all newly diagnosed hematological malignancies. About 195,000 Americans are living with CLL, and the prevalence is predicted to rise due to an aging population, high survival rates, and improved outcomes with novel treatments. The incidence of CLL has also increased in the last 20 years and is disproportionately affecting the elderly. It is estimated that there will be 21,250 new cases in 2021.
Multiple Sclerosis Overview
Relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and includes people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and people with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) who continue to experience relapses. RRMS is the most common form of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is characterized by episodes of new or worsening signs or symptoms (relapses) followed by periods of recovery. MS is the most prevalent chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS. It is estimated that nearly 1 million people are living with MS in the United States and over 2.3 million people world-wide are living with MS.

OUR PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT

We have leveraged our B-cell platform to develop a robust drug pipeline of both targeted orally available, potent and selective small molecule kinase inhibitors and intravenously delivered “off-the-shelf” immunotherapies that leverage the patient’s own immune system to fight cancer. We currently license worldwide development and commercial rights, subject to certain limited geographical restrictions, for all of our pre-clinical and clinical programs. The following table summarizes the current clinical trial status for our most advanced drug candidates as of February 2022.

Clinical Drug Candidate: (molecular target) | Initial Target Disease | Stage of Development(trial name) 
U2: Ublituximab (anti-CD20 mAb) and UKONIQ (PI3K-delta and CK1-epsilon inhibitor) | Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Relapsed or Refractory Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL) | Phase 3 trial (UNITY-CLL)Phase 3 trial (ULTRA-V)Phase 2b trial (UNITY-NHL)
Ublituximab (anti-CD20 mAb) | Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS) | Phase 3 trials (ULTIMATE I and II) 
Cosibelimab/TG-1501 (anti-PDL1 mAb) | B-cell cancers | Phase 1 trial 
TG-1701 (BTK inhibitor) | B-cell cancers | Phase 1 trial 
TG-1801 (anti-CD47/CD19 bispecific mAb) | B-cell cancers | Phase 1 trial 

​Ublituximab Overview
Ublituximab is an investigational glycoengineered monoclonal antibody that targets a unique epitope on CD20-expressing B-cells. When ublituximab binds to the B-cell it triggers a series of immunological reactions including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), leading to destruction of the cell. Additionally, ublituximab is uniquely designed to lack certain sugar molecules normally expressed on the antibody. Removal of these sugar molecules, a process called glycoengineering, has been shown to enhance the potency of ublituximab, especially the ADCC activity.
Targeting CD20 using monoclonal antibodies has proven to be an important therapeutic approach for the management of B-cell malignancies and autoimmune disorders, both diseases driven by the abnormal growth or function of B-cells.
Ublituximab is being evaluated in pivotal and early phase clinical trials for patients with NHL, CLL, and RMS.
Umbralisib - UKONIQ Overview

Umbralisib is an oral inhibitor of PI3K-delta and CK1-epsilon administered once daily. The phosphoinositide-3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a family of enzymes involved in many important cellular functions, including cell proliferation and survival, cell differentiation, intracellular trafficking, and immunity.
​
There are 4 isoforms of PI3K (alpha, beta, delta, and gamma), of which the delta isoform is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells and malignant lymphoid diseases. The PI3K pathway is among one of the most commonly mutated pathways across all of cancer biology. Umbralisib is highly selective for the delta isoform of PI3K and has limited to no impact on the other PI3K isoforms. Umbralisib also inhibits casein kinase 1 epsilon (CK1-epsilon). CK1-epsilon is a major regulator of oncoprotein translation, which drives growth and survival of lymphoma cells, including c-Myc. A manuscript titled, "Silencing c-Myc Translation as a Therapeutic Strategy through Targeting PI3K Delta and CK1 Epsilon in Hematological Malignancies," was published in the First Edition section of Blood, the Journal of the American Society of Hematology. Importantly, the manuscript for the first time reported on umbralisib’s unique complimentary mechanism of inhibiting the protein kinase casein kinase-1 epsilon (CK1e), which may lead to a differentiated safety profile by supporting T regulatory cells, a part of the immune system necessary to protect against autoimmune mediated toxicities.

In February 2021, we obtained accelerated approval of UKONIQ by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory MZL who have received at least 1 prior anti-CD20-based regimen and adult patients with relapsed or refractory FL who have received at least 3 prior lines of systemic therapy. Both indications were approved based on overall response rate observed in the UNITY-NHL trial. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. Shortly after receiving approval, we initiated our commercial launch of UKONIQ in the United States. We have staffed, trained and prepared a commercialization team comprising a field force of sales representatives and medical affairs professionals with deep experience in hematology.

Current Phase 3 or Registration-Directed Clinical Trials for Ublituximab and Umbralisib: 
The below are the current Phase 3 trials and registration-directed clinical trials of umbralisib and ublituximab. Select CLL and NHL trials are currently on partial clinical hold. (See discussion of UNITY-CLL below for more information on the partial clinical hold).
UNITY-NHL Phase 2b Trial: UNITY-NHL is a broad, multicenter, open-label, Phase 2b registration-directed clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of umbralisib monotherapy and U2 combinations in patients with previously treated NHL. 

● | UNITY-NHL MZL Single Agent Umbralisib Cohort: The MZL cohort enrolled adult patients who had at least one prior line of therapy that included an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. This cohort was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single agent umbralisib and the primary endpoint was ORR as determined by Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessment. Secondary endpoints included safety, duration of response, and progression-free survival (PFS).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In April 2019, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to umbralisib for the treatment of patients with any of the three types of marginal zone lymphoma (MZL): nodal, extranodal, and splenic MZL.
In March 2021, results from the UNITY-NHL Phase 2b trial were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology The results from the MZL single agent cohort supported the FDA approval of UKONIQ in this indication.

● | UNITY-NHL FL/SLL Single Agent Umbralisib Cohort: The FL/SLL cohort enrolled adult patients who had two or more prior lines of therapy that included an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and an alkylating agent. In October 2019, we announced that the FL patients within this cohort met the primary endpoint of ORR as determined by Independent Review Committee (IRC) for all treated follicular lymphoma patients (n=118). In March 2020, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to umbralisib, for the treatment of patients with FL. As noted above, in March 2021, results from the UNITY-NHL Phase 2b trial were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. The results from the FL single agent cohort supported the FDA approval of UKONIQ in this indication.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | UNITY-NHL Additional Cohorts: There are additional exploratory cohorts of the UNITY-NHL trial.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

●At ASH 2021, we presented data from a cohort of relapsed or refractory (R/R) MZL patients who were treated with the U2 combination. A total of 72 R/R MZL patients were enrolled. Patients had a median of 2 prior lines of therapy (range 1 - 9), with 25% refractory to their immediate prior therapy. Overall Response Rate (ORR) by independent review committee (IRC) was 70%, with 21% complete response (CR) rate (n=71). Median duration of response (DOR) was not reached at a median follow up of 20 months. Grade 3/4 AEs of clinical interest included diarrhea (13%), neutropenia (18%), ALT/AST increased (15%) and non-infectious colitis (2.8%).
●At ASH 2021, we also presented data from a cohort of R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A total of 226 patients were treated within this cohort, 30 patients received umbralisib monotherapy, 66 patients received U2, and 130 patients received U2 plus bendamustine. IRC assessed response rates included: 43% ORR and 17% CR for U2 plus bendamustine triple combination (n=130); 32% ORR and 11% CR for U2 double combination (n=66); 13% ORR and 3% CR for umbralisib monotherapy (n=30). IRC assessed median duration of response (DOR) was 3 months for umbralisib monotherapy, 28 months for U2 combination, and 8 months for U2 plus bendamustine. Both U2 and U2 + bendamustine demonstrated a manageable safety profile. Grade 3/4 AEs of special interest occurring in the U2 group (n=66) included ALT/AST increased (12%), non-infectious colitis (2%), diarrhea (2%), neutropenia (11%) and pneumonitis (2%). Grade 3/4 

10



AEs of special interest occurring in the U2 plus bendamustine group (n=130) included ALT/AST increased (5%), non-infectious colitis (2%), diarrhea (7%), neutropenia (27%), pneumonitis (1%) and rash (2%).

UNITY-CLL Phase 3 Trial Evaluating Umbralisib plus Ublituximab (U2): UNITY-CLL is a global Phase 3 randomized controlled clinical trial that includes two key objectives: first, to demonstrate contribution of each agent in the ublituximab plus umbralisib regimen (the combination sometimes referred to as "U2"), and second, to demonstrate superiority in PFS over the standard of care to support the submission for full approval of the combination. The study randomized patients into four treatment arms: ublituximab plus umbralisib, ublituximab alone, umbralisib alone, and an active control arm of obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil. The primary endpoint for this study is progression free survival (PFS). The UNITY-CLL trial is being led by John Gribben, MD, professor of Medical Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, United Kingdom. The study completed enrollment in October 2017 with over 600 patients across the four treatment arms, with approximately 420 patients in the U2 arm and the active control arm combined. 
In September 2015, we reached an agreement with the FDA regarding a SPA on the design, endpoints, and statistical analysis approach of the UNITY-CLL Phase 3 trial. The SPA provides agreement that the Phase 3 trial design adequately addresses objectives that, if met, would support the regulatory submission for drug approval of both ublituximab and umbralisib in combination. 
In May 2017, a pre-specified interim analysis was conducted to assess contribution of each single agent in the ublituximab plus umbralisib combination regimen, which allowed for the early termination of both single agent arms. A second interim analysis was planned to evaluate ORR to support accelerated approval when all patients in the U2 arm and the active control arm had at least 6 months of follow-up. In September 2018, we announced that the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewed ongoing data from the trial and advised us that the second interim analysis of ORR could not be conducted at that time as the data were not sufficiently mature to conduct the analysis. Given the uncertainty surrounding the timing and outcome of the ORR analysis, as well as the significant regulatory hurdles associated with accelerated approval in CLL, we decided to continue to conduct the trial under the SPA and seek full approval for U2 in patients with CLL based on the PFS endpoint, if positive. 
In May 2020, we announced the UNITY-CLL trial met the primary endpoint of improved PFS (p<.0001), and the trial would be stopped early for superior efficacy observed at the interim analysis. 
In October 2020, we announced the FDA granted Fast Track designation to the combination of ublituximab and umbralisib for the treatment of adult patients with CLL. The FDA previously granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) covering ublituximab in combination with umbralisib for the treatment of CLL.
On December 7, 2020, we presented safety and efficacy results from the UNITY- CLL trial at the ASH annual meeting, demonstrating that U2 significantly improved PFS over obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil (HR=0.54, p<0.0001) as well as ORR (p<0.001) in patients with CLL; with consistent PFS improvement across treatment naïve CLL (HR=0.48) and relapsed/refractory CLL (HR=0.60). Grade 3/4 Adverse Events (AEs) of clinical interest (U2 vs O+Chl) included elevated ALT (8.3% vs 1.0%), elevated AST (5.3% vs 2.0%), non-infectious colitis (1.9% vs 0%), infectious colitis (0.5% vs 0.5%), pneumonitis (0.5% vs 0%), rash (2.4% vs 0.5%), and opportunistic infections (5.8% vs. 1.5%).
 Based on data from the UNITY-CLL Phase 3 trial, submissions of a Biologics License Application (BLA) and a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) were made for ublituximab, in combination with UKONIQ, as a treatment for patients with CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The BLA and sNDA have been accepted by the FDA and a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 25, 2022 was set for both applications. 
 On November 30, 2021, we announced the FDA notified the Company that it plans to host a meeting of the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) in connection with its review of the pending BLA/sNDA. The FDA’s concern giving rise to the ODAC meeting appears to stem from an early preliminary analysis of overall survival (OS) from the UNITY-CLL trial which showed an imbalance in favor of the control arm (HR: 1.23), though the result was not statistically significant. However, when excluding deaths related to COVID-19, the two arms were approximately balanced (HR: 1.04) with again no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups with regard to overall survival. Further, we shared that the FDA notified us that potential questions and discussion topics for the ODAC include: the benefit-risk of the U2 combination in the treatment of CLL or SLL, and the benefit-risk of UKONIQ in relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) or follicular lymphoma (FL). In addition, as part of the benefit-risk analysis, the FDA has raised concerns regarding the overall safety profile of the U2 regimen, including adverse events (serious and Grade 3-4), discontinuations due to adverse 

11



events, and dose modifications, all of which are expected to be reviewed as part of the ODAC. The date of the ODAC meeting has not yet been determined, although the FDA has stated that it is targeting holding the ODAC meeting in March or April 2022. Given this timing, we believe it is unlikely that the FDA will make a decision on the BLA/sNDA by the PDUFA goal date of March 25, 2022. 
On January 27, 2022, we shared that we were nearing completion of a submission to the FDA of updated OS analyses from the UNITY-CLL Phase 3 trial that showed an improvement from the preliminary data originally shared with the FDA in November 2021. The original preliminary OS Hazard Ratio (HR) and the updated information were as of the same data cutoff of September 2021. On January 27, 2022, we also shared that the FDA imposed a partial clinical hold on select studies of U2 and its components for CLL and NHL. As a result of the partial clinical hold, no new patients may be enrolled to the select CLL/NHL studies identified by the FDA, however patients on these studies who are deriving clinical benefit can continue on therapy. The partial clinical hold appears to be based on the same concerns that gave rise to the previously disclosed ODAC meeting and not based on any new information provided by the Company to the FDA. Most studies included in the partial clinical hold were previously closed to new enrollment or were on Company administrative hold to new enrollment.
On February 3, 2022, the FDA released a Drug Safety Communication in which it announced that it is investigating a possible increased risk of death with UKONIQ based on the same concerns that gave rise to the previously disclosed ODAC meeting and not based on any new information provided by the Company to the FDA. In the Drug Safety Communication, the FDA stated that it is re-evaluating the benefit-risk profile of UKONIQ for its approved indications. The FDA encouraged healthcare providers to review patients’ progress on UKONIQ and discuss with them the risks and benefits of continuing UKONIQ in the context of other available treatments. The communication also encouraged patients to speak with their healthcare providers about the risks and benefits of UKONIQ and possible alternative treatments.
ULTRA-V Phase 2/3 Trial Evaluating U2 plus Venetoclax in CLL: The ULTRA-V trial is open-label, multicenter, registration-directed clinical trial designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of U2 combined with venetoclax in subjects with treatment naïve and relapsed or refractory CLL. The study is being conducted in two parts. The initial Phase 2 portion completed enrollment of approximately 165 patients in 1Q 2021. The Phase 3 portion commenced at approximately the same time. The ULTRA-V trial is being led Dr. Richard R. Furman, Morton Coleman, MD Distinguished Professor of Medicine Weill Cornell Medical College. 
​
The ULTRA-V Phase 2 portion of the trial is an open-label, multi-center, clinical trial, evaluating the efficacy and safety of U2 combined with venetoclax in patients with treatment naïve and relapsed or refractory CLL. The primary endpoints for this study are ORR and Complete Response (CR) rate. 
​
The ULTRA-V Phase 3 portion of the trial is an open-label, multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing the time-limited triple combination of U2 plus venetoclax to an active control arm of continuous U2. The Phase 3 trial includes two independent randomized cohorts of CLL subjects: a treatment-naïve cohort and a previously treated cohort, with each cohort being enrolled and evaluated independently of each other. The primary endpoint for the trial is PFS.
 ​
GENUINE Phase 3 Trial Evaluating Ublituximab plus Ibrutinib: GENUINE is a randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating patients with previously treated CLL with specific high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. Patients in this trial were randomized to receive either ublituximab plus ibrutinib or ibrutinib alone. In February 2021, final results from this trial were published in The Lancet Haematology, in a manuscript titled, “A Phase 3, Randomized Trial of Ublituximab Plus Ibrutinib for Patients With Relapsed/Refractory High-Risk Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia”.
ULTIMATE I & II Trials Evaluating Single Agent Ublituximab in RMS: ULTIMATE I and ULTIMATE II are two independent Phase 3 trials. Each trial is a global, randomized, multi-center, double-blinded, double-dummy, active-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety/tolerability of ublituximab (450mg dose administered by one hour intravenous infusion every six months, following a Day 1 infusion of 150mg over four hours, and a Day 15 infusion of 450mg over one hour) to teriflunomide (14mg oral tablets taken once daily) in subjects with RMS. The primary endpoint for each study is ARR following 96 weeks of treatment. This program is being led by Lawrence Steinman, MD, George A. Zimmermann Professor and Professor of Pediatrics, Neurology and Neurological Sciences at Stanford University.

In August 2017, we reached an agreement with the FDA regarding a SPA on the design of the ULTIMATE I and ULTIMATE II trials, for the treatment of RMS. The SPA provides agreement that the two Phase 3 trial designs adequately address objectives that, if met, would support the regulatory submission for approval of ublituximab in RMS.
In August 2018, we announced that target enrollment into the ULTIMATE I and II trials had been achieved, and that enrollment would continue into September 2018 to allow identified patients to participate in the study. At completion of full enrollment in October of 2018, approximately 1,100 subjects were enrolled in both studies combined.
​
In October 2019, at the 35th Congress of ECTRIMS, we presented the ULTIMATE I & II Phase 3 program trial design and demographic data. The presentation concluded that patient baseline characteristics were consistent with a typical RMS population.
​
In December 2020, we announced positive topline results from the ULTIMATE I & II trials. Both studies met their primary endpoint of significantly reducing ARR over a 96-week period (p<0.005 in each study) with ublituximab demonstrating an ARR of <0.10 in each of the studies. Relative reductions of approximately 60% and 50% in ARR over teriflunomide were observed in ULTIMATE I & II, respectively. Key secondary MRI endpoints were also met. 
​
 In April 2021, data from the ULTIMATE I & II trials were presented for the first time at the American Academy of Neurology Annual meeting. Additional data from these trials has been presented at various other medical meetings. 
​
 On December 14, 2021, we announced that the FDA accepted a BLA for ublituximab as a treatment for patients with RMS. The FDA set a PDUFA goal date of September 28, 2022 and notified the Company that it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss this application.

Current Early-Stage Clinical Development of Ublituximab and Umbralisib
​

● | Phase 1/2 Study of Umbralisib, Ublituximab and Venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL – In September 2021, we presented data from patients with relapsed/refractory CLL treated with the triple therapy combination of ublituximab, umbralisib and venetoclax during the XIX International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL). The regimen was administered with 3 cycles of U2 as induction in cycles 1 through 3, U2 plus venetoclax in cycles 4, 5 and 6, followed by umbralisib plus venetoclax in cycles 7 through 12 in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) CLL. Patients with centrally confirmed undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in the bone marrow after cycle 12 were permitted to stop all therapy, while MRD detectable patients continued on single agent umbralisib. 47 patients have now been treated as of the data cutoff with 57% of patients previously exposed to a BTK inhibitor. Best Overall Response Rate (ORR) was 100% amongst evaluable patients (n=46), including 37% complete response (CR) rate. At cycle 12, 91% of patients (n=34) achieved undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in the peripheral blood (PB), and 72% of patients (n=32) achieved uMRD in the bone marrow (BM). At a median follow up of 24.5 months, median progression-free survival has not been reached. Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) occurring in >5% of patients were neutropenia (28%), leukopenia (15%), lymphocytopenia (15%), infusion related reactions (9%), diarrhea (9%), and anemia (6%). No TLS events were observed during venetoclax administration.​

● | Phase 1 Study of TG-1701, a Once-Daily BTK inhibitor, as a Single Agent and in Triple Combination with Umbralisib and Ublituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL and CLL – In December 2021, we presented data from patients with relapsed/refractory NHL and CLL treated with TG-1701 monotherapy and the triple therapy combination of TG-1701, umbralisib and ublituximab during the ASH annual meeting and exposition. A total of 135 patients with R/R CLL or B-cell lymphoma were included in this presentation, with patients receiving 200 mg of TG-1701 in a dose-expansion cohort (n=61), 300 mg of TG-1701 in a CLL dose-expansion cohort (n=20), TG-1701 in combination with U2 in a dose escalation cohort (TG-1701 doses ranging from 100 – 300 mg once daily and umbralisib at either 600 mg or 800mg) (n=21), and a triple combination expansion cohort of 100mg of TG-1701 plus U2 (400 mg of umbralisib) (n=33). Overall Response Rate (ORR) and Complete Response (CR) outcomes included: 100% ORR observed in the CLL 300 mg QD TG-1701 monotherapy expansion cohort at a median follow up of 13.8 months (n=19); 95% ORR observed in the CLL 200 mg QD TG-1701 monotherapy expansion cohort at a median follow up of 20 months (n=20); 86% ORR, including 19% CR rate, observed in the 1701+U2 dose escalation cohort (using doses of 100 mg to 300 mg QD of TG-1701) at a median follow up of 20.2 months (n=21); 83% ORR, including 6% CR rate, observed in the 1701+U2 dose expansion cohort (using 100 mg QD of TG-1701 and 400 mg QD of umbralisib) at a median follow up of 2.7 months (n=18). Grade 3/4 AEs occurring in patients treated with 200 mg QD of TG-1701 (n=61) and 300 mg QD of TG-1701 (n=20), respectively, included neutropenia (8%, 20%), ALT increased (3%, 5%), AST increased (2%, 5%) and anemia (5%, 0%). Grade 3/4 AEs

● | Phase 2 Study Evaluating the Addition of Ublituximab and Umbralisib (U2) to Ibrutinib in Patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL): A Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)-Driven, Time-Limited Approach-Limited Approach – In December 2021 at the ASH annual meeting we presented data from this trial which utilized an “add-on” approach, where the combination of umbralisib and ublituximab (U2) was added to therapy in patients who were on ibrutinib for greater than 6 months and had detectable minimum residual disease (MRD). Patients who achieve undetectable MRD (uMRD) or those who completed 24 cycles of therapy with detectable MRD stop all therapy and enter a period of treatment-free observation (TFO). Patients with clinical progression during TFO are eligible for re-treatment with the U2 + ibrutinib combination. 28 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were enrolled, with 27 evaluable for efficacy. Patients were on ibrutinib for a median of 21 months (range 7-67) prior to study entry. 77% of evaluable patients achieved uMRD, with a median time to first uMRD of 7.4 months. Grade 3/4 AEs included diarrhea (4%), hypertension (7%), ALT/AST increased (4%) and COVID-19 (4%).

● | Phase I/II Study of Umbralisib (TGR-1202), Ublituximab (TG-1101), and Pembrolizumab in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Richter’s Transformation: 5-Year Follow-up – In September 2021 we presented data from this trial at the XIX iwCLL conference. A total of 20 patients with R/R CLL or Richter’s Transformation (RT) were treated with the triple combination of ublituximab, umbralisib, and pembrolizumab. Patients with CLL received 2 cycles of the U2 regimen before pembrolizumab was added for an additional 4 cycles, followed by umbralisib maintenance. Patients with RT received U2 + pembrolizumab for the first 4 cycles, followed by U2 maintenance. Twenty patients were evaluable for safety (11 CLL patients and 9 RT patients) and 19 were evaluable for efficacy (11 CLL and 8 RT). The triple combination was well tolerated, with immune mediated toxicities not appearing above what would be expected with either umbralisib or pembrolizumab alone. Grade 3/4 AEs occurring in >20% of patients (n=20) include, neutropenia (45%), thrombocytopenia (15%), ALT increase (15%), leukopenia (10%), nausea (5%), fatigue (5%), and anemia (5%). In this heavily pre-treated cohort with a median of 2 (1-9) prior lines of therapy: 91% ORR in patients with R/R CLL (n=11); 83% ORR in BTK refractory CLL patients (n=6), with 4 of 5 responders achieving a response to U2 alone at the patient’s first efficacy assessment, prior to the addition of pembrolizumab; % ORR in patients with RT (n=8), including 25% CR.

Early Pipeline Overview and Clinical Development
​
TG-1501 (Cosibelimab) Overview

Cosibelimab (also referred to as TG-1501) is a fully human monoclonal antibody of IgG1 subtype that binds to Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and blocks its interactions with PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. Cancer cells elude anti-tumor immunity through multiple mechanisms, including upregulated expression of ligands for inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors. Signals from PD-L1 on tumor cells and in the tumor microenvironment help those tumors avoid immune attack and elimination by preventing activation of tumor specific effector T-cells. Anti-PD-L1 antibodies are designed to block that signal, permitting effector T-cells to attack the cancer. Clinical studies have shown that blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway by monoclonal antibodies can enhance the immune response and result in anti-tumor activity.

Preclinically, it has been shown that the effects of anti-PD-L1 intervention can be enhanced by utilizing other mechanisms targeting the tumor microenvironment. Combining immunotherapies like anti-PD-L1, which counters the tumor's immune-evading defense system with other anti-cancer agents such as ublituximab or umbralisib, may better engage the body's own immune system to help fight cancer.

A comprehensive array of in vitro biochemical and cellular assays was established to characterize the binding and the functional activities of cosibelimab. The in vitro data demonstrated that the affinity, PD-L1 binding capability, relative ability to inhibit PD-1/PDL-1 interactions, and functional activity of cosibelimab in cellular assays are comparable to those of atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab - the currently approved products sharing the same mechanism of action.
​
 Cosibelimab is currently being evaluated in ongoing studies of patients with select solid tumors, by our licensor.

14



In December 2018, the FDA approved an IND for cosibelimab and a Phase 1 study in subjects with select subtypes of lymphoma commenced in 2019, as did a study of cosibelimab in combination with ublituximab and/or umbralisib. Based on our rapidly evolving understanding of the pathobiology of lymphoma subtypes, we envision further combinations with other immunotherapies in the future.

TG-1701 (BTK inhibitor) Overview

TG-1701 is a novel, orally available and covalently-bound Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that exhibits superior selectivity to BTK compared to ibrutinib in in vitro kinase screening.

B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is crucial for normal B-cell development and supports the survival and growth of malignant B-cells in patients with B-cell leukemias or lymphomas. Targeting BTK, an essential element of BCR signaling pathway which regulates the survival, activation, proliferation, and differentiation of B lymphocytes, has shown remarkable efficacy with an acceptable safety profile in B-cell malignancies.

In June 2018, pre-clinical data for TG-1701 demonstrating favorable pharmacologic properties was presented at the 23rd Congress of the European Hematology Association (EHA) in Stockholm, Sweden. In vitro pharmacology studies have revealed that TG-1701 inhibited BTK with greater than 10-fold selectivity as measured by IC50 on the kinase activities of EGFR, ITK, TXK, JAK3, HER2 and HER4. In vivo pharmacology studies showed that TG-1701 significantly inhibited the growth of xenograft lymphoid tumors including OCI-LY-10 and DOHH-2 in nude mice.

We are currently evaluating TG-1701 in a Phase 1, multi-center, dose-escalation clinical trial in patients with B-cell malignancies. This trial is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TG-1701 alone and in combination with U2 in adults with B-cell malignancies and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose. Key secondary objectives include evaluation of pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anticancer activity. Data from this trial was most recently presented at ASH 2021 (described above).

TG-1801 (anti-CD47/anti-CD19 bispecific monoclonal antibody) Overview

TG-1801 is a first-in-class, bispecific CD47 and CD19 antibody. It is the first therapy to target both CD19, a B-cell specific market widely expressed across B-cell malignancies, and CD47, the "don’t eat me" signal used by both healthy and tumor cells to evade macrophage mediated phagocytosis. CD47 is expressed ubiquitously on normal cells, including red blood cells and platelets. CD19 is a specific B-cell marker, expressed early during pre-B cell ontogeny and until terminal differentiation into early plasma cells. The majority of B-cell lineage malignancies (more than 90%) express CD19, including NHL, CLL and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Tumor B-cells that have lost the expression of CD20 after anti-CD20 mAb therapy, have been found to maintain the expression of CD19, making CD19 an attractive target in the treatment of B cell malignancies. By co-targeting both CD47 and CD19, TG-1801 has the potential to overcome the limitations of existing CD47 targeted therapies by avoiding the side effects caused by indiscriminate blockade of CD47 on healthy cells. In addition to potentially enhancing tolerability, the co-targeting of CD19 by TG-1801 may provide a secondary mechanism of direct anti-tumor activity through the engagement of effector cells and induction of ADCC.

TG-1801 binds to human CD19 with significantly higher affinity than towards CD47. This difference between its affinity to CD19 and CD47 allows TG-1801 to bind and selectively block CD47 on CD19+ B-cells but not on CD19- red blood cells or platelets in human peripheral blood.

In in vitro assays, TG-1801 induces antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and ADCC of malignant tumor B-cell lines and primary tumor B-cells from patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and numerous subtypes of NHL.

In in vivo mouse tumor models, treatment with TG-1801 inhibited tumor growth in Raji cell subcutaneous xenograft model, NALM-6 cell disseminated tumor model, and patient-derived xenograft models, including primary tumor cells from patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and B-ALL. In addition, the combination of rituximab and TG-1801 demonstrated enhanced activity over TG-1801 monotherapy.

In summary, TG-1801 demonstrates anti-tumor activity in both in vitro assays (ADCP and ADCC) and in vivo animal tumor models.

In the first quarter of 2019, we commenced a Phase 1 first-in-human, dose-escalation study of TG-1801. This study is evaluating escalating doses of TG-1801 in patients with B-Cell lymphoma. The primary objective of the study is to determine the recommended Phase 

15



2 dose and to characterize the safety profile of TG-1801. Key secondary objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of TG-1801 and its preliminary anticancer activity
​
In the first half of 2021, we commenced a second Phase 1 study of TG-1801 in the US to continue dose optimization as monotherapy and in combination with ublituximab. Enrollment in this study is ongoing.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS
 ​
General
 ​
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.
 ​
We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. This knowledge, trade secrets, proprietary information and experience we call “know-how.” To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. There can be no assurance, however, that we can prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets, know-how and proprietary information despite the existence of confidentiality agreements.
 ​
Patents and other proprietary rights are crucial to the development of our business. We will be able to protect our proprietary technologies from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents, supported by regulatory exclusivity or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We have a number of patents and patent applications related to our compounds and other technology, but we cannot guarantee the scope of protection of the issued patents, or that such patents will survive a validity or enforceability challenge, or that any of the pending patent applications will issue as patents.
 ​
Generally, patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in secrecy for a period of 18 months or more. Since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we are not certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file those patent applications. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Therefore, we cannot predict the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents, or their enforceability. To date, there has been no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents. Third parties or competitors may challenge or circumvent our patents or patent applications, if issued. If our competitors prepare and file patent applications in the U.S. that claim technology also claimed by us, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before we commercialize any of our products, any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization, thus reducing any advantage of the patent. However, the life of a patent covering a product that has been subject to regulatory approval may have the ability to be extended through the patent restoration program, although any such extension could still be minimal. If a patent is issued to a third party containing one or more preclusive or conflicting claims, and those claims are ultimately determined to be valid and enforceable, we may be required to obtain a license under such patent or to develop or obtain alternative technology. In the event of litigation involving a third-party claim, an adverse outcome in the litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to such third party, require us to seek a license for the disputed rights from such third party, and/or require us to cease use of the technology. Further, our breach of an existing license or failure to obtain a license to technology required to commercialize our products may seriously harm our business. We also may need to commence litigation to enforce any patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. Litigation would involve substantial costs.

We, or those companies from which we have licensed our drug candidates, file patent applications directed to our drug candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions regarding these new chemical entities as well as uses of these new chemical entities in the treatment of diseases. We also file patent applications directed to novel combinations of our drugs together and with drugs developed by others. The intellectual property portfolios for our most advanced drug candidates as of February 2022 are summarized below. Each of these portfolios contains one or more pending patent applications covering our products and product candidates and uses and combinations thereof. For those patents, prosecution is in progress. Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the USPTO is often significantly narrowed by the time they issue, if they issue at all. This may be the case with respect to our pending patent applications referred to below.

 ​
Limitations on Patent Rights and Trade Secrets
 ​
The patent rights that we own or have licensed relating to our product candidates are limited in ways that may affect our ability to exclude third parties from competing against us if we obtain regulatory approval to market these product candidates. See “Item 1A – Risk Factors -- Risks Related to the Company’s Intellectual Property.” In addition, the limited patent protection may adversely affect the value of our products or product candidates and may inhibit our ability to obtain a corporate partner at terms acceptable to us, if at all.
 ​
Proof of direct infringement by a competitor for method of use patents can prove difficult because the competitors making and marketing a product typically do not engage in the patented use. Additionally, proof that a competitor contributes to or induces infringement of a patented method of use by another can also prove difficult because an off-label use of a product could prohibit a finding of contributory infringement, and inducement of infringement requires proof of intent by the competitor.
 ​
Moreover, physicians may prescribe such a competitive identical product for indications other than the one for which the product has been approved, or off-label indications, that are covered by the applicable patents. Although such off-label prescriptions may directly infringe or contribute to or induce infringement of method of use patents, such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute.
 ​
Orphan Drug Designation
 ​
In addition to patent protection, we may utilize orphan drug regulations or other provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended, or FDCA, to provide market exclusivity for certain of our drug candidates. Orphan drug regulations provide incentives to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop and manufacture drugs for the treatment of rare diseases, currently defined as diseases that exist in fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or, diseases that affect more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. but that the sponsor does not realistically anticipate will generate a net profit. Under these provisions, a manufacturer of a designated orphan-drug can seek tax benefits, and the holder of the first FDA approval of a designated orphan product will be granted a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity for such FDA-approved orphan product.
 ​
Pursuant to these regulations, ublituximab received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of MZL (Nodal and Extranodal) in September 2013, for the treatment of CLL in August of 2010, and Orphan Drug Designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of CLL in November of 2009.
 ​
We also obtained Orphan Drug Designation for umbralisib as monotherapy for the treatment of CLL in August 2016, for the treatment of nodal, extranodal, and splenic MZL in April 2019, and for the treatment of FL in March 2020. In addition, in January 2017, we announced that the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation covering the combination of ublituximab and umbralisib for the treatment of patients with CLL and DLBCL. 
 ​
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 ​
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. An application for a patent term extension for 

18



UKONIQ has been submitted, and we intend to apply for, or work with our licensing partners to apply for, patent term extensions for any products approved by the FDA in the future, depending on the factors involved in the development program and filing and review of the relevant NDA or the BLA.
 ​
Also, under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, drugs that are new chemical entities (NCEs) are eligible for a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also provide three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations. During this period, FDA will not approve an application filed by a third party for the protected conditions of use that relies on any of the data from the new clinical investigations that was submitted by the innovator company. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA that does not rely on the innovator company’s data. 
 ​
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) created a 12-year period of data exclusivity for innovator biologics. FDA therefore cannot approve a biosimilar application relying on data for a specific reference product until 12 years after the reference product is first licensed. BLA supplements are not eligible for any additional exclusivity. The objectives of the BPCIA are conceptually similar to those of the Hatch-Waxman Act described above. The implementation of an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products is under the direction of the FDA. Since the enactment of the BPCIA, the FDA has issued several draft guidance’s for industry related to the BPCIA, addressing scientific, quality and procedural issues relevant to an abbreviated application for a biosimilar product. As of December 2021, the FDA had approved 33 biosimilar applications.
 ​
Orphan drug exclusivity, as described below, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial. 
 ​
 LICENSING AGREEMENTS AND COLLABORATIONS
 ​
We have formed strategic alliances with a number of companies for the manufacture and commercialization of our products. Our current key strategic alliances are discussed below.

 ​
UKONIQ (umbralisib)
 ​
In September 2014, we exercised our option to license the global rights to umbralisib, thereby entering into an exclusive licensing agreement (the Umbralisib License) with Rhizen Pharmaceuticals, S A (Rhizen) for the development and commercialization of umbralisib. Prior to this, we had been jointly developing umbralisib in a 50:50 joint venture with Rhizen.
 ​
Under the terms of the TGR-1202 License, Rhizen received a $4.0 million cash payment and 371,530 shares of our common stock as an upfront license fee. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid Rhizen $12.0 million as part of a primary indication approval milestone for launch of product in the US in accordance with the terms of the Umbralisib License. Rhizen will be eligible to receive additional approval and sales-based milestone payments in the aggregate of approximately $175 million payable upon approval in multiple jurisdictions for up to two oncology indications and one non-oncology indication and attaining certain sales milestones. In addition, if umbralisib is co-formulated with another drug to create a new product (a New Product), Rhizen will be eligible to receive similar regulatory approval and sales-based milestone payments for such New Product. Additionally, Rhizen receives tiered royalties that escalate from high single digits to low double digits on any net sales of umbralisib and any New Product. Rhizen shall also be eligible to participate in sublicensing revenue, if any, based on a percentage that decreases as a function of the number of patients treated in clinical trials following the exercise of the license option. Rhizen will retain global manufacturing rights to umbralisib, provided that they are price competitive with alternative manufacturers. The license will terminate on a country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the last licensed patent right or any other exclusivity right in such country, unless the agreement is earlier terminated (i) by us for any reason, or (ii) by either party due to a breach of the agreement.
 ​
Cosibelimab
 ​
In March 2015, we entered into a global collaboration (the Collaboration) with Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (Checkpoint) for the development and commercialization of Checkpoint’s anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibody research programs in the field of hematological malignancies with an option to acquire rights in autoimmune diseases. These antibodies were generated at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Dana-Farber). In June 2019, we amended our Collaboration Agreement with Checkpoint to cover additional licenses necessary to continue the development of the anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR research programs. Under the terms of the initial Collaboration, we made an up-front payment of $0.5 million, and upon entering into the amended agreement, made an additional payment of $1.0 million. In March 2020, we achieved the first milestone event, and we subsequently paid Checkpoint $1.0 million as part of this milestone. Under the terms of the amended agreement, we will make development and sales-based milestone payments up to an aggregate of approximately $110 million and will pay a tiered low double-digit royalty on net sales. The royalty term will terminate on a country by country basis upon the later of (i) ten years after the first commercial sale of any applicable licensed product in such country, or (ii) the expiration of the last-to-expire patent held by Dana Farber containing a valid claim to any licensed product in such country.

TG-1701 (BTK inhibitor)
 ​
In January 2018, we entered into a global exclusive license agreement with Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., (Hengrui), to acquire worldwide intellectual property rights, excluding Asia but including Japan, and for the research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of products containing or comprising of any of Hengrui’s Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors containing the compounds of either TG-1701 (SHR-1459 or EBI-1459) or TG-1702 (SHR-1266 or EBI-1266) for hematologic malignancies. Pursuant to the agreement, we paid Hengrui an upfront fee of $1.0 million in our common stock in April 2018. In addition, in July 2019, we paid Jiangsu the first milestone under the agreement of $0.1 million in our common stock. In July 2020, we paid Hengrui $2.0 million as part of a milestone in accordance with the license agreement. Hengrui is eligible to receive milestone payments totaling approximately $350 million upon and subject to the achievement of certain milestones. Various provisions allow for payments in conjunction with the agreement to be made in cash or our common stock, while others limit the form of payment. Royalty payments in the low double digits are due on net sales of licensed products and revenue from sublicenses. Additionally, before we can license, sell, develop, or commercialize ublituximab within China, we must notify Hengrui, giving Hengrui the right of first offer. The agreement allows combinations of TG-1701 or TG-1702 with umbralisib, ublituximab, or U2. Additional combinations may be undertaken under the agreement subject to additional pre-specified payments to Hengrui.
 ​
The term of the agreement expires after the expiration of the last royalty term to expire with respect to any of the patent rights under the agreement. We or Hengrui may terminate the agreement upon notice to the other upon breach without remedy or upon insolvency. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement upon a material breach, after providing the other party with adequate notice and allowing 45 days to cure.
 ​
TG-1801 (anti-CD47/anti-CD19 bispecific antibody)
 ​
In June 2018, we entered into a Joint Venture and License Option Agreement with Novimmune SA (Novimmune) to collaborate on the development and commercialization of Novimmune’s novel first-in-class anti-CD47/anti-CD19 bispecific antibody known as TG-1801 (previously NI-1701). The companies will jointly develop the product on a worldwide basis, focusing on indications in the area of hematologic B-cell malignancies. We serve as the primary responsible party for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of the product. Pursuant to the agreement, in June 2018 we paid Novimmune an upfront payment of $3.0 million in our common stock. Further milestone payments will be paid based on early clinical development, and the Company will be responsible for the costs of clinical development of the product through the end of the Phase 2 clinical trials, after which the Company and Novimmune will be jointly responsible for all development and commercialization costs. The Company and Novimmune will each maintain an exclusive option, exercisable at specific times during development, for the Company to license the rights to TG-1801, in which case Novimmune is eligible to receive additional milestone payments totaling approximately $185 million as well as tiered royalties on net sales in the high single to low double digits upon and subject to the achievement of certain milestones.
 ​
IRAK4
 ​
In June 2014, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Ligand) for the development and commercialization of Ligand's interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase-4 (IRAK4) inhibitor technology, which currently is in preclinical development for potential use against certain cancers and autoimmune diseases. IRAK4 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is a key downstream signaling component of the interleukin-1 receptor and multiple toll-like receptors.
 ​
Under the terms of the license agreement, Ligand received 125,000 shares of our common stock as an upfront license fee. Ligand will also be eligible to receive maximum potential milestone payments of approximately $207.0 million upon the achievement of specific clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone events. Additionally, Ligand will be entitled to royalties on our future net sales of licensed products containing IRAK4 inhibitors. The basic royalty rate for licensed products covered by Ligand's issued patents will be 6% for annual sales of up to $1 billion and 9.5% for annual sales in excess of that threshold. The license will terminate on a country by country basis upon the expiration of the last licensed patent right or 10 years after the first commercial sale of a product in such country, unless the agreement is earlier terminated by either party due to a breach of the agreement in the event of the insolvency of the other party.

TG-1601 (BET)
 ​
In May 2016, as part of a broader agreement with Jubilant Biosys (Jubilant), we entered into a sub-license agreement (JBET Agreement) with Checkpoint for the development and commercialization of Jubilant’s novel BET inhibitor program in the field of hematological malignancies. The BET inhibitor program is the subject of a family of patents covering compounds that inhibit BRD4, a member of the BET (Bromodomain and Extra Terminal) domain for cancer treatment. Our BET inhibitor program is currently in pre-clinical development.
 ​
Under the terms of the agreement, we paid Checkpoint an up-front licensing fee of $1.0 million and will make additional payments contingent on certain preclinical, clinical, and regulatory milestones, including commercial milestones totaling up to approximately $177 million and a single-digit royalty on net sales. TG will also provide funding to support certain targeted research efforts at Jubilant.
​
COMPETITION
 ​
Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, companies that are active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us. Many of our competitors have significantly greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater experience in drug development, regulation, manufacturing and marketing than we do. These organizations also compete with us to recruit qualified personnel, attract partners for joint ventures or other collaborations, and license technologies that are competitive with ours. To compete successfully in this industry, we must identify novel and unique drugs or methods of treatment and then complete the development of those drugs as treatments in advance of our competitors.
 ​
The drugs that we are attempting to develop will have to compete with existing therapies. In addition, a large number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting. Some of these potential competing drugs are further advanced in development than our drug candidates and may be commercialized earlier. The resulting changes in standard of care can impact the likelihood of regulatory accelerated approval opportunities for our drug candidates.
 ​
For the cancer indications for which we received FDA approval of UKONIQ or for which we are developing U2 and our other product candidates, there are a number of established therapies with which we will compete:
 ​

● | For the treatment of MZL, we expect UKONIQ to compete with zanubrutinib (BeiGene), ibrutinib (AbbVie and Janssen), and the combination of rituximab and lenalidomide (Bristol-Myers Squibb), as well as established treatments such as rituximab (Roche) and several generically available chemotherapies. In addition, there are investigational PI3K inhibitors being developed in MZL.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | For the treatment of FL, we expect UKONIQ to compete with recently approved drugs such as axicabtagene ciloleucel (Gilead), obinutuzumab (Roche), tazemetostat (Epizyme), and the combination of rituximab and lenalidomide (Bristol-Myers Squibb), and established treatments such as rituximab (Roche), and several generically available chemotherapies, many of which have FDA-approved indications for earlier lines of therapy (e.g., after two prior lines of systemic therapy) than UKONIQ. There are also PI3K delta inhibitors in earlier stages of development for FL.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | For the treatment of CLL, if U2 is approved, we expect the regimen to compete with approved drugs such as ibrutinib (AbbVie and Janssen), acalabrutinib (AstraZeneca), venetoclax (AbbVie and Roche), obinutuzumab (Roche), idelalisib (Gilead) and duvelisib (Secura Bio, Inc.), and established treatments such as rituximab (Roche), and several generically available chemotherapies. Additionally, there are second generation BTK inhibitors similar to ibrutinib in late-stage clinical testing for CLL that could enter the market. These agents can be used as monotherapy or in combination with one or more of the other agents.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In addition, a number of pharmaceutical companies are developing antibodies and bispecific antibodies targeting CD20, CD19, CD47 and other B-cell associated targets, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy, and other B-cell ablative therapy which, if approved, would potentially compete with U2 and UKONIQ.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
For Multiple Sclerosis for which we are developing ublituximab, there are a number of established therapies with which we will compete:
 ​

● | If ublituximab is approved, we expect ublituximab will primarily compete against other CD20-targeted agents, while the group of CD20-targeted agents will also compete broadly against a number of already approved MS therapies. Currently, there are two anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies approved, ocrelizumab (Roche) and ofatumumab (Novartis).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22



Cosibelimab, TG-1701 and TG-1801 if approved will also face competition from drugs on the market and under development in the same therapeutic class as each of those drugs.
 ​
Additional information can be found under Item “1A - Risk Factors – Other Risks Related to Our Business” within this report. 
 ​
SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING
 ​
We have limited experience in manufacturing products for clinical or commercial purposes. We currently do not have any manufacturing capabilities of our own. We have established a contract manufacturing relationship for the supply of ublituximab with Samsung Biologics. For the supply of umbralisib, Rhizen has established contract manufacturing relationships as part of our licensing agreement. As with any supply program, obtaining pre-clinical and clinical materials of sufficient quality and quantity to meet the requirements of our development programs cannot be guaranteed and we cannot ensure that we will be successful in this endeavor.
​
Process improvements and other changes are common during clinical development to accommodate raw material and component variability, enhance productivity and/or accommodate different or larger equipment utilized during the scale-up process required for commercial manufacture. These types of incremental process changes have been made during clinical development for both TG’s small and large molecule programs. For example, our UNITY-CLL Phase 3 clinical trial contains ublituximab produced from both a pre-commercial process and the current commercial process. While there are some analytical differences between the two materials, we do not expect those differences to have an effect on the clinical performance of ublituximab. The primary difference is that the commercial process has resulted in further enhancement to the ADCC effect, potentially enhancing potency. We will analyze the Phase 3 data to ensure that the materials are substantially similar in performance. If there are material differences in safety or efficacy, we may need to adjust our statistical analysis of the Phase 3 study, which could impact the approvability of the U2 combination in CLL.
 ​
At the time of commercial sale, to the extent possible and commercially practicable, we would seek to engage back-up suppliers for raw materials, manufacturing and testing services for each of our product candidates. Until such time, we expect that we will rely on a single contract manufacturer to produce each of our product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations. Our third-party manufacturers have a limited number of facilities in which our product candidates can be produced and will have limited experience in manufacturing our product candidates in quantities sufficient for commercialization. Our third-party manufacturers will have other clients and may have other priorities that could affect their ability to perform the work satisfactorily and/or on a timely basis. Both of these occurrences would be beyond our control. 
 ​
We expect to similarly rely on contract manufacturing relationships for any products that we may in-license or acquire in the future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contract with such manufacturers on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 ​
Contract manufacturers in the U.S. are subject to ongoing periodic and unannounced inspections by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration if applicable, and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other state and federal regulations. Contract manufacturers outside of the United States face similar challenges from the numerous local and regional agencies and authorized bodies. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and standards, other than through contractual obligations. If they are deemed out of compliance with cGMPs, product recalls could result, inventory could be destroyed, production could be stopped and supplies could be delayed or otherwise disrupted.
 ​
If we need to change manufacturers after commercialization, the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies must approve these new manufacturers in advance, which will involve testing, regulatory submissions, and additional inspections to ensure compliance with FDA regulations and standards and may require significant lead times and delay. Furthermore, switching manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer quickly or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 ​
GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATION
 ​
Numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies, impose substantial regulations upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of our product candidates, as well as our ongoing research and development activities. We, along with our third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various pre- and post-approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the jurisdictions in which we wish to conduct clinical studies or market our product 

23



candidates. None of our product candidates, except UKONIQ, have been approved for sale in any market in which we have marketing rights. Before marketing in the U.S., any drug that we develop must undergo rigorous pre-clinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory review and approval process implemented by the FDA under the FDCA and, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act). The FDA regulates, among other things, the pre-clinical and clinical testing, safety, efficacy, approval, manufacturing, quality control and assurance, record keeping, pharmacovigilance and adverse event reporting, packaging, labeling, storage, advertising, promotion, import and export, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 ​
Product Development and Applications for Marketing Authorization
 ​
The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. We are required to submit extensive pre-clinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA for each indication or use to establish a drug candidate’s safety and efficacy before we can secure FDA approval to market or sell a product in the U.S. The approval process takes many years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources and may involve ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies or surveillance. Before commencing clinical trials in humans, we must submit an IND to the FDA containing, among other things, pre-clinical data, chemistry, manufacturing and control information, and an investigative plan. Our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.
 ​
For purposes of clinical development and to pursue NDA or BLA approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases:

● | Phase 1: The drug is administered to a small group of humans, either healthy volunteers or patients, to test for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, excretion, and clinical pharmacology.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: Studies are conducted on a larger number of patients to assess the efficacy of the product, to ascertain dose tolerance and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional data relating to safety and potential adverse events.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3: Studies establish safety and efficacy in an expanded patient population.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 4: The FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to find out more about the drug’s long-term risks, benefits, and optimal use, or to test the drug in different populations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Clinical testing must meet requirements for institutional review board oversight, informed consent and good clinical practices, and must be conducted pursuant to an IND, unless exempted. In addition, the FDA, equivalent foreign regulatory authority, or a data safety monitoring committee for a trial may place a clinical trial on hold or terminate it if it concludes that subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, or for futility. Any drug is likely to produce some toxicity or undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for a sufficiently long period of time. Unacceptable toxicity or side effects may occur at any dose level at any time in the course of studies in animals designed to identify unacceptable effects of a drug candidate, known as toxicological studies, or clinical trials of drug candidates. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of any of our drug candidates and could ultimately prevent approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications.
​
The length of time necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and may be difficult to predict. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials, or that may increase the costs of these trials, include: 

● | slow patient enrollment due to the nature of the clinical trial plan, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for participation in the study or other factors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring clinical trials or delays in approvals from a study site’s review board;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy or determine the appropriate product dose;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | insufficient supply of the drug candidates;
--+--------------------------------------------


● | adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | ineffectiveness of the drug candidates.
--+----------------------------------------

 ​
For clinical trials that are intended to form the basis of a new drug or biologics license application for approval, sponsors of drugs may apply for an SPA from the FDA, by which the FDA provides official evaluation and written guidance on the design and size of proposed protocols. While obtaining an SPA provides some assurance the design of a trial should be sufficient for approval, the final marketing approval depends on the results of efficacy, the adverse event profile and an evaluation of the benefit/risk of treatment demonstrated in the 

24



Phase 3 trial. The SPA agreement may only be changed through a written agreement between the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of a substantial scientific issue essential to product safety or efficacy.
​
In September 2015, we reached an agreement with the FDA regarding an SPA on the design, endpoints and statistical analysis approach of a Phase 3 clinical trial, referred to as the UNITY-CLL trial, for the proprietary combination of ublituximab and umbralisib, for the treatment of CLL. The SPA provides agreement that the Phase 3 trial design adequately addresses objectives that, if met, would support the regulatory submission for drug approval of both ublituximab and umbralisib in combination. Additionally, in August 2017, we reached an agreement with the FDA regarding an SPA on the design of two Phase 3 clinical trials for ublituximab, referred to as the ULTIMATE I and ULTIMATE II Phase 3 clinical trials, for the treatment of relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS). The SPA provides agreement that the two Phase 3 trial designs adequately address objectives that, if met, would support the regulatory submission for approval of ublituximab. Despite obtaining an SPA the trials may not be positive and even if positive may not support FDA approval.
 ​
The FDA may permit expedited development, evaluation, and marketing of new therapies intended to treat persons with serious or life-threatening conditions for which there is an unmet medical need under its expedited drug development programs. A sponsor can apply for Fast Track designation at the time of submission of an IND, or at any time prior to receiving marketing approval of the new drug application, or NDA. To receive Fast Track designation, an applicant must demonstrate:

● | that the drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The FDA must respond to a request for Fast Track designation within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Over the course of drug development, a product in a Fast Track development program must continue to meet the criteria for Fast Track designation. Sponsors of products in Fast Track drug development programs must be in regular contact with the reviewing division of the FDA to ensure that the evidence necessary to support marketing approval will be developed and presented in a format conducive to an efficient review. Sponsors of products in Fast Track drug development programs are also permitted to submit portions of an NDA or BLA to the FDA on a rolling basis where the FDA may consider reviewing portions of a marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application.
​
In addition, sponsors may also apply to the FDA for Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD). The procedures and requirements for BTD are similar to those required for Fast Track such that the Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a potential new drug for serious or life-threatening diseases, however, with BTD, there is a further requirement that the sponsor present “preliminary clinical evidence” which “indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.” The designation of a drug as a Breakthrough Therapy was enacted as part of the 2012 Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act.
​
In January 2019, we announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for umbralisib for the treatment of adult patients with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have received at least one prior anti-CD20 regimen based on interim results from a subset of patients from the MZL cohort of the UNITY-NHL clinical trial.
​
Sponsors of drugs granted Fast Track or breakthrough therapy designation also may seek approval under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations. Under this authority, the FDA may grant marketing approval for a new drug product on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely, based on epidemiologic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other evidence, to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. To obtain accelerated approval a sponsor must be able to demonstrate the drug candidate treats a serious condition, provides a meaningful advantage over other available therapies, and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Many companies have filed for accelerated approval and have subsequently failed to obtain such approval for a variety of reasons. To the extent a product does obtain an accelerated approval, such approval will be subject to the requirement that the applicant study the drug further in a post-marketing confirmatory clinical trial to verify and describe its clinical benefit where there is uncertainty as to the relation of the surrogate endpoint to clinical benefit or uncertainty as to the relation of the observed clinical benefit to ultimate outcome. Accelerated approval is sometimes referred to as conditional approval because if the results of these confirmatory clinical trials fail to verify clinical benefit, the FDA has the right to remove the drug from the market and has done so in the recent past. Post-marketing confirmation studies are usually underway at the time an applicant files the NDA. When required to be conducted, such post-marketing confirmation studies must also be adequate and well-controlled. The applicant must carry out any such post-marketing confirmation studies with due diligence. Completing the required post-approval clinical studies as designed can be difficult, especially as the treatment landscape evolves. For example, the challenges in completing such studies have prompted some companies with products that 

25



received accelerated approval for relapsed or refractory FL to withdraw that indication (e.g., duvelisib (December 2021), idelalisib (January 2022)). 
​
In February 2021, we obtained accelerated approval of UKONIQ for relapsed or refractory MZL who have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based regimen and for relapsed or refractory FL who have received at least three prior lines of systemic therapy. The FDA approved these indications based on overall response rate. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.
​
It is also becoming more common for the FDA to request a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as part of an NDA/BLA. The REMS plan contains post-market obligations of the sponsor to train prescribing physicians, monitor off-label drug use, and conduct Phase 4 follow-up studies and registries to ensure the continued safe use of the drug.
​
The NDA and BLA review process also generally includes a pre-approval inspection, or PAI, to assess the manufacturing facilities and relevant processes and data for compliance, and readiness for commercial manufacture in accordance with cGMPs. Among the conditions of approval is the requirement that a manufacturer’s quality systems and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP. Even when product approval is received, manufacturers must expend significant time, money and effort to ensure continued compliance, and the FDA conducts periodic surveillance inspections to monitor the manufacturing process and drug quality and evaluate whether the manufacturers are in compliance. It may be difficult for our manufacturers or us to comply with the applicable cGMP, as interpreted by the FDA, and other FDA regulatory requirements. If we, or our contract manufacturers, fail to comply, then the FDA may not allow us to market products that have been affected by the failure. Many drug approvals have been delayed due to issues at contract manufacturing facilities. If we were to experience any such delay that would negatively impact our business and timeline to commercialization of any of our drug candidates affected by such manufacturing issue.
​
Post-Approval Requirements
​
Any products for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and other federal and state regulators on a wide range of matters, including, among other things cGMPs and product quality, pharmacovigilance and reporting of adverse events, product distribution requirements, fulfilling post-marketing or confirmatory study or REMS commitments, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Violations of the FDCA or other post-approval regulatory requirements may result in agency enforcement actions, including withdrawal of approval, recall, seizure of products, warning letters, injunctions, fines and/or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 ​
The FDA promotion and advertising requirements applicable to marketed products include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions against promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not either described in the product’s approved indications and uses or otherwise consistent with the FDA-approved product labeling, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, rules regarding communication of health care economic information regarding biopharmaceutical products to payors and formularies, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs whose review was accelerated may carry additional requirements on marketing activities, including the requirement that all promotional materials are pre-submitted to the FDA. Although a healthcare provider may prescribe a product for a use that has not been approved by the FDA when the healthcare provider deems such use to be appropriate in his or her professional medical judgment, manufacturers may not market or promote unapproved uses. Although court decisions have to some degree impacted FDA’s enforcement activity regarding alleged off-label promotion in light of First Amendment considerations, there are still significant risks in this area, in part because there is the potential for False Claims Act exposure in addition to the potential for enforcement under the FDCA.
 ​
After product approval, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements. FDA regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMPs. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments and list their products with the FDA and certain state agencies. Manufacturers and their third-party contractors may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for assessment of compliance with cGMPs and other applicable laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain quality control and manufacturing compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, including, among other things, withdrawal of approval, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval or notification before being implemented. Other 

26



types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims to the product labeling, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
​
Marketed products must meet the requirements of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, which regulates the commercial distribution of prescription drug products at the federal level. The DSCSA sets certain standards for federal or state registration, requires tracing of products through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain, and imposes other requirements on entities in the supply chain, including manufacturers and repackagers, wholesale distributors, third-party logistics providers, and dispensers. The DSCSA requirements, development of standards, and the system for product tracing have been and will continue to be phased in over a period of years, with FDA indicating enforcement discretion on certain aspects due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
​
In addition, the post-marketing discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and may require the implementation of other risk management measures. 
​
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations, guidance documents, and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
​
Should we wish to market our products outside the U.S., we must receive marketing authorization from the appropriate foreign regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Importantly, the level of evidence of efficacy and safety necessary to apply for marketing authorization for a drug candidate differs from country to country. In particular, clinical trial endpoints, and the level of clinical evidence that may support an accelerated approval filing with the FDA, such as the ORR data from the single-arm cohorts of the UNITY-NHL study that we used as the basis for a filing and approval for UKONIQ in MZL and FL, may be insufficient to file for marketing applications outside of the U.S. At present, companies are typically required to apply for foreign marketing authorizations at a national level. However, within the European Union, centralized registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product across the European Union member states. Typically, if the regulatory authority is satisfied that a company has presented adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy, then the regulatory authority will grant a marketing authorization. This foreign regulatory approval process, however, involves risks similar or identical to the risks associated with FDA approval discussed above, and therefore we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain the appropriate marketing authorization for any product in any particular country.
​
Failure to comply with applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of new drugs are subject to future changes. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, effect or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
 ​
Coverage and Reimbursement
 ​
Sales of our drugs will depend, in part, on the extent to which our drugs will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical drugs and services. In addition, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of foreign and U.S. federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, importation, and requirements for substitution of generic drugs. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our drug candidates, if approved, or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our drug candidates could reduce physician usage of such drugs and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.

In the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, enacted in March 2010, has had a significant impact on the health care industry. The Affordable Care Act expanded coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, created a new average manufacturer price definition under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected and not generally dispensed through the retail channel, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period (subsequent legislation increased this to 70% effective as of January 1, 2019), as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.
 ​
Since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act have been subject to judicial challenges as well as efforts to repeal or replace them or to alter their interpretation or implementation. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 (the Tax Act), eliminated the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly referred to as the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. Although litigation and legislation over the Affordable Care Act are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results, we expect that the Biden administration may seek to expand and strengthen the Affordable Care Act. 
​
There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. The Biden administration has indicated that lowering prescription drug prices is a priority and has proposed a number of measures to do so, including allowing the federal government to negotiate prices for some high-cost drugs covered under Medicare Part B and Part D, requiring inflation rebates to limit annual increases in drug prices in Medicare and private insurance, and capping out-of-pocket spending for Medicare Part D enrollees. Although the fate of these proposals remains uncertain, we expect that additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures could be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that the U.S. federal government will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in additional pricing pressures and reduced demand for any of our products that receive marketing approval.
 ​
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control prescription drug pricing, including price and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, authorizing importation of prescription drugs from other countries. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, which could limit the amounts that state governments will pay for healthcare products and services and result in additional pricing pressures.
 ​
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a prescription drug must be approved before the drug may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the United Kingdom and many European Union member states have robust health technology assessment processes to determine pricing and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals through their national health insurance system. Many European Union members states also include either direct or indirect price referencing, or other price control mechanisms, in determining the price of a pharmaceutical in their market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical drugs will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, drugs launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to be significantly lower.
 ​
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws
 ​
We may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we may market our product candidates, if approved. These laws include, without limitation: state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security laws; laws governing interactions with healthcare professionals and related transparency requirements (such as the federal Sunshine Act and a range of state biopharmaceutical marketing and transparency laws); and requirements for manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government 

28



authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs. The compliance and enforcement landscape is informed by government enforcement precedent and settlement history, Advisory Opinions, and Special Fraud Alerts. The risks we face and our approach to compliance may evolve over time in light of these types of developments. The potential safe harbors available for, example, relative to the Anti-Kickback Statute, are subject to change through legislative and regulatory action, and we may decide to adjust our business practices or be subject to heightened scrutiny as a result. 
 ​
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on research, consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians that the government alleged were not based on the provision of bona fide services and were intended as an inducement or reward. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
 ​
In addition, the civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the U.S., for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
​
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
​
There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which publicly posts the data on its website. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
​
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal 

29



HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, according to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers' personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company's data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Medical data is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC's guidance for appropriately securing consumers' personal information is similar to what is required under HIPAA.
 ​
In addition, we may be subject to state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, the California Consumer Protection Act, or CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, established a privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, data privacy rights for consumers in California, and a potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. The CCPA was recently amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), expanding certain consumer rights such as the right to know. It remains unclear what, if any, additional modifications will be made to these laws by the California legislature or how these laws will be interpreted and enforced. The potential effects of the CCPA and CPRA are significant and may cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply.
 ​
Rest of the World Healthcare Regulation 
 ​
For other countries outside of the U.S. and the European Union, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, sales and marketing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 ​
European Union member states, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and other foreign jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the European Union and the United Kingdom, the collection and use of personal data, including clinical trial data, is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the European Union member states and the United Kingdom governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular, these obligations and restrictions concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the European Union or the United Kingdom, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data and imposition of substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations. Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business to ensure full compliance. Furthermore, European data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in or from the European Union or United Kingdom.
