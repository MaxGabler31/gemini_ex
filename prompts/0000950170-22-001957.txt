Business Overview
 What we do
 We provide fixed wireless broadband and Wi-Fi networking infrastructure solutions for commercial and government network operators as well as broadband service providers and other network operators, including large industrial organizations, innovative broadband service providers, and public and private networks across the globe. Our scalable, reliable and high-performance solutions enable the creation of a purpose-built wireless fabric that connects people, places and things with a unified wireless fabric that spans multiple standards and frequencies of fixed wireless and Wi-Fi, all managed centrally via the cloud, deployed indoors and outdoors. Our multi-gigabit wireless fabric offers a compelling value proposition over traditional fiber and alternative wireless solutions.
Our wireless fabric includes intelligent radios, smart antennas, radio frequency, or RF, algorithms, wireless-aware switches and our on-premise or cloud-based network management software. Our embedded proprietary RF technology and software enables automated optimization of data flow at the outermost points in the network, which we refer to as the “intelligent edge.” This intelligent edge offers network operators increased performance, visibility, control and management, as well as the ability to efficiently transfer large amounts of data back to enterprise data centers for fast and efficient analysis and decision-making even in conditions characterized by a high degree of interfering signals generated both within the network or from outside sources, which we refer to as noise. Our products support licensed and unlicensed spectrum, tailored for many frequency bands. We provide deep technical and operational expertise based on years of deploying networks, resulting in ease of use of our products, and all Cambium Networks solutions are backed by our global organization that provides 24/7 support services tailored to meet the business needs of our end users.
Our solutions are deployed by wireless broadband internet service providers, mobile network operators, and managed service providers, as well as in private networks, including enterprises, petrochemical, military, state and local government, education, hospitality, rail, utility, industrial and other network operators. Our technology is used to connect a wide range of network assets, from offices, service organizations (schools, hospitality, healthcare) and industrial processes, to guest and public access via Wi-Fi to complex sensor networks. Network operators deploy our enterprise-grade solutions to take advantage of their scalability, intelligence, reliability, durability, attractive economics and ease of deployment.
 We market and sell our solutions through our global channel partner network, which drives a substantial majority of our revenues. We sell our solutions as one-time sales as well as a growing number of subscription-based products, with a majority of our revenues in a given period typically being generated by purchases from network operators that have previously purchased our products. Growth from these network operators is driven by expansion within existing networks and in new territories, replacement of competitor products with our solutions, deployment of new and incremental use cases and, in the case of local governments, mandates to offer fixed broadband wireless to all of their citizens.
 How our solutions work
 We offer fixed wireless broadband networking infrastructure solutions differentiated by scalability, embedded intelligence, reliability, high quality at attractive economics and ease of deployment. Our enterprise-grade Wi-Fi solutions provide indoor and outdoor capabilities and leading spectral efficiency that reduces self-interference and optimizes spectral efficiency and frequency reuse across the network.
Our Point-to-Point, or PTP, solutions are typically connected to high-speed, high-bandwidth wireline networks, and provide wireless broadband backhaul to facilities or Point-to-Multipoint, or PMP, access points deployed throughout a network over distances of more than 100 kilometers and at more than 2 Gbps. Our PMP solutions extend wireless broadband access from tower mounted fixed wireless access points to CPE providing broadband access to residences and enterprises covering wide areas with a range of 10 to 30 kilometers. Our PMP solutions are increasingly used to backhaul video surveillance systems. Our cnPilot and Xirrus Wi-Fi solutions provide distributed access to individual users in indoor settings, such as office complexes, and outdoor settings, such as athletic stadiums and outdoor public Wi-Fi spots, over distances as short as two meters with high capacity. Our cnReach solutions offer narrow-band connectivity typically using licensed spectrum below 1 GHz and typically used by industrial customers connecting remote field operations supporting sensors and devices at the network edge. Our embedded proprietary RF technology and software enables automated optimization of data flow at the outermost points in the network. Our cnMatrix cloud-managed wireless-aware switching solution provides the intelligent interface between wireless and wired networks. Our cnVision solutions are purpose built wireless connectivity solutions for video surveillance and CCTV deployments and provide the necessary bandwidth to transport mission-critical video wirelessly, for the video surveillance market.

 Our cloud-based cnMaestro network management platform and our Xirrus XMS Cloud platform provide users with an integrated, intelligent, easy to use tool for end-to-end network management of our portfolio from the network operating center to individual customer premise equipment, or CPE, on a single pane of glass. cnMaestro’s interface allows users to easily onboard large numbers of new devices, configure existing devices, monitor the entire network and troubleshoot end-to-end. Our cnHeat solution is a network planning subscription service that provides a heat map coverage model display of locations that are available for fixed wireless broadband connectivity that aids in network planning. cnHeat utilized LiDAR or equivalent geospatial data to accurately model the geography being evaluated, coupled with highly accurate RF modeling, to render a visual and quantitative assessment of anticipated RF coverage and performance. cnHeat allows network operators to optimize site selection for coverage, supporting their total cost of ownership and return on investment.
 LINKPlanner is a comprehensive tool, developed over the past 12 years, used to plan PTP and PMP networks. LINKPlanner allows users to visualize and analyze hypothetical network deployment scenarios to evaluate performance and reliability allowing for cost-effective expansion and deployment of their networks. cnArcher is a smartphone app that accelerates installation and deployment of our products by field technicians.
 Network operators and distribution channel
 We sell our solutions globally through our channel partners to wireless Internet service providers, mobile network operators, enterprises and government agencies. As of December 31, 2021, we had over 11,300 channel partners, which includes over 170 distributors. Wireless Internet service providers using our products are typically serving between 1,000 and more than 200,000 subscribers. Enterprises using our products are in industries such as oil and gas, agriculture, mining, utilities, transportation, surveillance, hospitality, education and general corporate enterprises. Government entities using our products include local government agencies, federal agencies and defense organizations.
Through our channel sales network, we sell to our global network of distributors who in turn either sell directly to network operators or supply our products to value added resellers. These channel partners provide lead generation, pre-sales support and product fulfillment. Playing a central role in the channel, distributors support us by promoting and distributing our products in target vertical markets, providing value-added support to the reseller channel by bringing core strengths in technical support and professional services, all in addition to financing, logistics, and sales and marketing support. Our distributors typically stock and manage inventory of our products.
 Our ConnectedPartner program is designed to maximize global coverage while minimizing channel conflict and enhance the ability of our channel partners to succeed in the sale and deployment of our products and solutions. Channel partners registered under our ConnectedPartner program gain access to product discounts, sales and marketing tools, marketing materials, specifications sheets, case studies and solution papers to aid in the sale and deployment of our products and solutions globally. We also offer access through our ConnectedPartner program to technical product training, deal registration, account management support, business development support, webinars and events, promotions and joint marketing initiatives, and qualified lead information as well as participation in our demonstration equipment programs.
Sales and marketing
 We promote the sale of our products globally in partnership with our channel partners as well as through our direct sales force. Our sales organization typically engages directly with large Internet service providers and certain enterprises even though product fulfillment generally involves our channel partners, and also provide sales support to our channel partners across the platform. Our sales organization includes field and inside sales personnel, as well as regional technical managers with deep technical expertise who are responsible for pre-sales technical support and solutions engineering for network operators, systems integrators and channel partners. As of December 31, 2021, we had 125 sales personnel located in 21 countries.
 Our marketing activities consist primarily of technology conferences, web marketing, trade shows, seminars, webinars and events, public training classes, public relations, analyst relations, demand generation and direct marketing to build our brand, increase customer awareness, communicate our product advantages and generate qualified leads for our field sales force and channel partners.
 Support and service
 Customer support
 We provide multiple layers of support: technical support, information-sharing with an experienced community of users, software downloads, warranty services, and repair. We support our enterprise class solutions with a range of flexible service plans and 24/7 availability that provide assurance to network operators that their always-on, mission critical communications requirements will be met. With every product purchase, Cambium Networks provides technical support on a best-effort basis. Hardware issues are diagnosed via joint troubleshooting with the end user and the issue will be addressed according to standard warranty status and the root cause of the issue. This may be sufficient for some customers who can largely manage and operate their network without assistance and hold adequate spares. For others, Cambium Networks provides three support programs staffed by our skilled technical support team and product support engineers to keep the network operating smoothly and efficiently and may provide 24x7x365 technical support and premium warranty support and allow network operators to select the service level that best meets their needs. Our support organization both supports channel partners in supporting their direct customers and provides first-line support to our direct customers. Technical support is also available on-line via chat and automated ticketing systems.
Training
 We work closely with our channel partners and network operators to provide comprehensive product training so that they are familiar with the implementation and usage of our products. The training and certification system is administered through a learning management system that provides the user a record of their course work, exam results, current certifications and access to on demand self-directed training resources that complement instructor-led sessions scheduled frequently around the world. In 2017, we also launched Cambium College, a free education program where senior members of our design and development teams share their experience to familiarize people with the math and physics concepts involved in designing and operating a wireless broadband or Wi-Fi network.
Cambium Community Forum
 To complement our customer support and training, we launched the Cambium Community Forum in 2014 as a platform where we, our network operators and our channel partners can collaborate in real-time on practical solutions to real-world deployment situations, contribute to and consult a collective online knowledge base concerning our products and best practices, and share stories and photographs of customer experiences about product installations and unique use cases of our technology. In 2019, we added discussion forums focusing on CBRS, Video Surveillance, and Wi-Fi 6. Our Community Forum is moderated by our staff with direct and active engagement by our development engineering and product management personnel. Leveraging the Community Forum, we collect network operator and channel partner feedback on potential product improvements and new product ideas, including through the administration of beta testing on our products. As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 41,000 registered forum members on our Community Forum.

Manufacturing and supply
 We outsource the manufacturing of our products to third party manufacturers. For some of our products, we do substantially all of the design work; for other products, we outsource both the design (in whole or in part) and the manufacture of the product; and for several products we distribute and sell a product designed and manufactured by a third party under our name on a white label basis. We require all of our primary contract manufacturers to be ISO-9001 certified.
 Our third-party manufacturing partners generally procure the components needed to build and assemble our products according to our design specifications. This allows us to leverage the purchasing power of our contract manufacturing partners. For items that we design, we generally retain complete control over the bill of material, test procedures and quality assurance programs. For other products, the third party may control the bill of material. We review, on an ongoing basis, forecasts, inventory levels, processes, capacity, yields and overall quality. Our third-party manufacturers procure components and assemble our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based on historical trends and analyses from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. Generally, for our primary third-party manufacturers, we update these forecasts monthly.
 Once the completed products are manufactured and tested, configured, inspected and pass quality control inspection, our contract manufacturers ship the products to our direct fulfillment facilities in Kentucky, the Netherlands and Shanghai for shipment to our distributor partners and network operators. We outsource the warehousing and delivery of our products at these fulfillment facilities to a third-party logistics provider for worldwide fulfillment. For the majority of our products, our customers ship products from our fulfillment facilities on an ex works basis and are responsible for shipping and other costs and for fulfilling import and other customs and duties requirements.
 While components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources, we and our contract manufacturers currently depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for several components for our products. We do not always have a second source for these components readily available. In addition, we currently have a limited number of suppliers for several other components for our products. We and our contract manufacturers generally rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with these suppliers, although for certain components our contract suppliers have contracts in place with component suppliers that we are able to leverage. In periods of shortages, we have in the past and may in the future need to build inventory of select components. If we need to seek a suitable second source for key components or to modify our designs to use substitute components, our ability to meet the demand for our products, and as a result our business and operating results, could suffer.
We have been constrained by the global component part shortages, particularly the shortage in available semiconductor chipsets and related components, as the global integrated circuit supply is under pressure as demand surpasses supply capacity, causing foundries to allocate existing supply among their customers. These supply constraints are occurring at a time of increasing demand for us and others globally, particularly from automotive as well as the migration from 4G to 5G technology, and the continued need for connectivity as workers continue remote working, further exacerbating the supply constraint. As a result, we are experiencing increased lead times for the supply of many of our products, impacting our ability to timely supply our customers. In particular, semiconductor chips and merchant silicon and related semiconductor parts are currently in high demand with limited supply, which is resulting in significantly longer than usual lead times and increased costs for these components. We have encountered, and are likely to continue to encounter, shortages and delays in obtaining these and other components, and this has and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer orders and cause a delay or reduction in our revenues. Shortages are expected to continue into 2022. In addition, such shortages or delays are resulting in increased component and delivery costs, as suppliers raise the cost of components, causing our manufacturing costs to increase. We have also experienced price increases in base commodities, impacting component pricing generally and in particular for electromechanical commodities, as well as extended lease times from any of our suppliers. These component shortages and increases in costs, and extension of lead times, have impacted, and are expected to continue over the short term to continue to impact our sales and revenues, and our gross margins and net income. To meet some of these challenges, we have increased the lead-times to our customers and increased our forecasts to our suppliers to provide better linearity in our supply and be better able to meet our customer orders, particularly for critical parts.
Logistics challenges remain as well, as container shortages continue to lengthen availability times of containers and carriage, resulting in increases in relevant freight costs, all at a time when demand across many of our product lines has increased, together with increasing demand for shipment of many other products globally. Shutdowns in China due to coal shortages, lockdowns in South Asia due to the continued impact of COVID-19, increases in gas prices, and labor shortages particularly for logistics, continue to impact our supply operations. Ports have increasing lead times with delays becoming commonplace in the container freight market as port delays, worker shortages and the impact of COVID-19 are impacting the ability to import and export goods, particularly from China. Logistics and freight costs are increasing substantially as a result. We are also experiencing increasing rates, resulting in increased use of expedited freight modes due to supply shortages. The use of expedited freight modes has increased our cost of revenues, resulting in a decrease in our gross margins, and is expected to continue in the short term.
Our suppliers and manufacturers in China and elsewhere could continue to be disrupted by worker absenteeism, quarantines, office and factory closures due to COVID-19, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, or other travel or health-related restrictions. In addition, freight and logistics constraints caused in part by restrictions imposed by governments to combat the COVID-19 pandemic have increased costs and constrained available transport, for us and our channel partners. If our supply chain operations
continue to be affected or are curtailed by the outbreak of diseases such as COVID-19, our supply chain, manufacturing and product shipments will be delayed, which could adversely affect our business, operations and customer relationships. We have and may continue to need to seek alternate sources of supply which may be more expensive, unavailable or may result in delays in shipments to us and from our supply chain and subsequently to our customers. See “Risk Factors, We face risks related to actual or threatened health epidemics and other outbreaks, which could significantly disrupt our manufacturing, sales and other operations” below.
Research and development
 As of December 31, 2021, our research and development organization has over 280 employees located primarily in San Jose and Thousand Oaks, California, Rolling Meadows, Illinois, Ashburton, United Kingdom and Bangalore, India. We also work with contract engineers in various locations globally. Our research and development team has deep expertise and experience in wireless technology, antenna design and network architecture and operation. We expect to continue to expand our product offerings and solutions capabilities in the future and to invest significantly in continued research and development efforts.
Intellectual property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our core technology and innovations. We rely on federal, state, common law and international rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties, such as Internet service providers, vendors, individuals and entities that may be exploring a business relationship with us. In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and domain names to protect our intellectual property. We seek patent protection for certain of our key innovations, protocols, processes and other inventions. We pursue the registration of our trademarks, service marks and domain names in the United States and England and in certain other locations outside of these jurisdictions. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving. Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 90 issued U.S. patents and 142 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as 6 U.S. and 29 foreign patent applications pending. We file patent applications in the United States and other countries where we believe there to be a strategic technological or business reason to do so. Although we actively attempt to utilize patents to protect our technologies, we believe that none of our patents, individually, are material to our business.
 Competition
 The market for wireless broadband solutions is rapidly evolving, highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. We expect competition to persist, intensify and increase in the future.
 In all of our markets, we compete with a number of wireless equipment providers worldwide that vary in size and in the products and solutions offered. Our competitors for products and solutions for the unlicensed, sub-6 GHz spectrum bands include Ubiquiti, Airspan, Radwin, MikroTik, Ligowave, and HFCL Group. Our 28 GHz cnWave mm-Wave product competes with Intracom, Nokia, and Samsung. Our 60 GHz cnWave mmWave product competes with Siklu, Adtran, and MikroTik. In the licensed microwave market, our competitors include SIAE, SAF Technica and Aviat Networks, among others. Our Wi-Fi products and solutions compete with Aruba (HPE), Ruckus (CommScope), Extreme Networks, Ubiquiti and Meraki (Cisco). Our cnReach IIoT products and solutions compete principally with GE MDS and Freewave. Our cnMatrix cloud-managed switch platform competes with Ubiquiti, Ruckus (CommScope), Aruba (HPE) and MikroTik. Our cnMatrix Ethernet enterprise switching products and solutions compete with MikroTik, Ubiquiti and Aruba (HPE).
As our target markets continue to develop and expand, and as the technology for wireless broadband continues to evolve, we expect competition to increase and expand from both established and emerging market participants.
The market for our products and solutions is influenced by a variety of factors, including the following:
 •Total cost of ownership and return on investment associated with the solutions;
 •Ease of configuration, installation and use of the solution;
 •Ability to provide a complete compatible solution;
 •Broad application across a range of use cases and frequencies;
 •Product quality, functionality and reliability;
 •Ability to allow centralized management of the solutions to enable better network planning, including scalable provisioning, configuration, monitoring and complete network visualization; and
 •Ability to provide quality, full service pre- and post-sales product support.
 We believe we compete favorably on each of these factors.
 Regulatory requirements
 In addition to regulations of general application to global businesses, we are subject to a number of regulatory requirements specific to our industry, including, without limitation:
 •Radio frequency usage. Because our products transmit energy in radio frequency spectrum, our products are subject to:
 •rules relating to radio frequency spectrum allocation and authorization of certain radio equipment issued by the Federal Communications Commission for non-federal uses or the National Telecommunications and Information Administration for federal uses; and 
 •local type approval, or homologation, rules requiring confirmation that our products meet minimum regulatory, technical and safety requirements prior to sale in various countries around the world, for example: European Technical Standards Institute (ETSI), Industry Canada (IC) and Agencia National De Telecommunicatoes (Anatel). 
 The applicable regulatory agencies in each jurisdiction adopt regulations to manage spectrum use, establish and enforce priorities among competing uses, limit harmful radio frequency interference and promote policy goals such as broadband deployment. These spectrum regulations regulate allocation, licensing, and equipment authorizations. Since our customers purchase devices to operate in specific spectrum bands allocated by the regulatory authorities, our products must meet the technical requirements set forth for such spectrum allocation(s).
 In some bands, the operator, such as our customer, must seek prior regulatory authority to operate using specified frequencies, and the resulting spectrum license authorizes the licensee, for a limited term, to operate in a spectrum consistent with licensed technical parameters within a specified geographic area. We must design and manufacture our products to comply with these technical parameters.
 Our products generally are subject to compliance testing prior to approval, and, as a condition of authority in each jurisdiction, we must ensure that our products have the proper labels and documentation specifying such authority. We generally use telecommunications certification bodies to obtain certification for our devices in each jurisdiction in which we intend to market and sell our products.
•Trade compliance requirements. We are subject to compliance with rules in jurisdictions from which we export or into which we import our products, including export control and reporting, import clearance, anti-bribery, antitrust and competition rules and regulations, including:
 •Import and export requirements issued by the United States, the European Union or other jurisdictions, including the U.S. Department of Commerce, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, Ministry of Defense and Department of International Trade including rules banning sales to persons or entities on applicable designated parties lists, or to persons or entities in embargoed countries, rules requiring export licenses prior to sales of products incorporating encryption technology to certain end users, and local rules governing import of products, including packaging and labeling laws. In addition, some of our products include enabled encryption technology, which may require us to obtain a license prior to a sale to certain foreign agencies. These rules require us to monitor databases of, and establish and enforce policies to prohibit the sale of our products to, embargoed persons, entities and countries. 

•Rules and regulations, particularly in the United States and the European Union, governing environmental matters that restrict the use of certain dangerous substances in electrical or electronic equipment, govern use of certain chemical substances throughout their lifecycle and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, Directive 2012/2019/EU, related to the collection, treatment, recycling and recovery of waste electrical and electronic equipment in the European Union and related laws elsewhere. These rules govern our use of components in our products, requiring us to comply with environmental rules and regulations in our selection of component parts and in the manufacturing process, as well as over the disposal upon destruction or retirement of our products.
 We are also subject to rules governing our use of personal data, such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and other applicable regulations in the United States and around the world, and current and proposed e-privacy and direct marketing rules governing direct and email marketing. These rules govern how we use personal data of our employees, customers and others with whom we might do business, including in our marketing activities.

 We offer what we believe is a competitive compensation package, tailored to the job function and geography of each employee. Our team is global, and we offer competitive and meaningful compensation and benefits programs that meet the diverse needs of our employees, while also reflecting local market practices. We believe our compensation structure aligns with our shareholders’ long-term interests by balancing profitability and growth, as well as current market practices, and reflects our commitment to pay for performance. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology space is intense, and our success depends in large part on our ability to recruit, develop and retain a productive and engaged workforce. Accordingly, investing in our employees and their well-being, offering competitive compensation and benefits, promoting diversity and inclusion, adopting progressive human capital management practices and community outreach constitute core elements of our corporate strategy. In addition to competitive salaries and bonuses or sales commissions, we offer a robust employment total rewards package that promotes employee well-being and includes health care, extended parental leave, and paid time off, including extended leave for new parents (moms, dads and partners) to care for a newborn or newly adopted child.
 We also offer rewards and recognition programs to our employees, including peer-led recognition of employees who best exemplify our values. We believe that these recognition programs help drive strong employee performance. We conduct annual employee performance reviews, where each employee is evaluated by their manager as well as a self-assessment. Employee performance is assessed based on a variety of key performance metrics, including the achievement of corporate objectives and objectives specific to the employee’s department or role.
 We grant equity-based compensation to many of our employees and have extended the opportunity for equity ownership through our recently launched employee share purchase plan in the United States, the United Kingdom and India, which we hope to extend to other jurisdictions in the future. Additionally, we offer benefits to support our employees’ physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health and encourage healthy behaviors and facilitate a number of employee support groups.

Our Compensation Committee oversees our company-wide compensation programs and practices, and our Chief Executive Officer and Vice President of Human Resources regularly update our Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee on human capital matters.
 COVID-19 Response
 During the COVID-19 pandemic, our primary focus has been on the safety and well-being of our employees and their families. A large majority of our workforce worked remotely and successfully throughout most of 2021. Our offices are open on a voluntary basis for employees that have needed access to our offices, for example in order to use lab or test equipment, or who no longer wish to work from home, and for access we have followed the advice and recommendations of medical experts to maintain protocols to ensure the safety of our employees, including face coverings, health certifications, social distancing and capacity limits.
