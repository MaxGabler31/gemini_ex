Item 1. Business
 Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the identification, acquisition, development, and commercialization of novel products for the treatment of serious rare and ultra-rare diseases, with a focus on serious, debilitating genetic diseases. We target diseases for which the unmet medical need is high, the biology for treatment is clear, and for which there are no currently approved therapies. Since our inception in 2010, we have in-licensed potential treatments for multiple rare genetic disorders. Our strategy, which is predicated upon time- and cost-efficient drug development, allows us to pursue multiple programs in parallel with the goal of delivering safe and effective therapies to patients with the utmost urgency.
 Our approved product and current product candidate pipeline have been either in-licensed from academic institutions or derived from partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies. Our strategy is to acquire and retain global commercialization rights to our products to maximize long-term value, where possible. We have built our own commercial organization, which is highly targeted due to the relatively small number of specialists who treat patients with rare and ultra-rare diseases. 
 The patients we seek to treat have diseases with limited or no treatment options, and we recognize that their lives and well-being are dependent upon our efforts to develop new therapies. For this reason, we are passionate about developing these therapies with the utmost urgency and care. 
 We were founded in April 2010 by our current President and Chief Executive Officer, Emil Kakkis, M.D., Ph.D. We have assembled an experienced team with extensive rare disease drug development and commercialization capabilities. Dr. Kakkis and the team at Ultragenyx have been previously involved at other companies in the development and/or commercialization of many therapies approved or in development for rare genetic diseases. 
 On November 7, 2017, we completed our acquisition of Dimension Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Upon the closing of the acquisition, we paid aggregate consideration of approximately $152.3 million, not including related transaction fees and expenses, using available cash and investments. For additional information regarding the acquisition, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
 Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is to identify, acquire, develop, and commercialize novel products for the treatment of rare and ultra-rare diseases in the United States, or U.S., the European Union, or EU, and select international markets, with the goal of becoming a leading rare disease biotechnology company. The critical components of our business strategy include the following: 

• | Focus on rare and ultra-rare diseases with significant unmet medical need and clear biology. There are numerous rare and ultra-rare genetic diseases that currently have no approved drug therapy and for which no therapies are currently in development. Patients suffering from these diseases often have a high unmet medical need with significant morbidity and/or mortality. We are focused on developing and commercializing therapies for multiple such indications with the utmost urgency. We also focus on diseases that have biology that is well understood. For example, MepseviiTM is a replacement therapy for a single deficient enzyme and several of our product candidates are replacement therapies for a single deficient substrate in the body. We believe that developing drugs that directly impact known disease pathways will increase the probability of success of our development programs. Our four modalities of small molecules, biologics, mRNA and AAV gene therapy provide us with what we believe is an optimal set of options to treat metabolic genetic diseases by selecting the best treatment strategy available for each disease.

• | Leverage our experience and relationships to in-license promising product candidates; retain global commercialization rights to product candidates. Our management team seeks to develop and maintain strong relationships with key opinion leaders in the genetic field and leverage our success in the development and commercialization of therapies for rare and ultra-rare genetic diseases. All of our current clinical product candidates are in-licensed from academic institutions or derived from partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies. We believe parties agree to license product candidates to us because they are confident in our team’s drug development capabilities and our plans and execution thus far in bringing rare disease therapies to market. We intend to seek and retain global commercialization rights to our product and product candidates whenever possible to maximize the potential value of our product portfolio. Because we typically in-license product candidates that require translational or clinical research, at this time we do not intend to invest significant capital in basic research, which can be expensive and time-consuming.

• | Focus on excellent, rapid, and efficient clinical and regulatory execution on multiple programs in parallel. We believe that building a successful and sustainable rare disease-focused company requires very specific expertise in the areas of patient identification, clinical study design and conduct, and regulatory strategy. We have assembled a team capable of managing global clinical development activities in an efficient manner and with multinational experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for rare disease products. Clinical development programs for rare and ultra-rare diseases can often be smaller in size than those for larger market indications. Development of multiple programs in rare diseases also generates organizational efficiencies and economies of scale. We also seek to manage our fixed cost structure by outsourcing most manufacturing of our product and product candidates. As a result of these efficiencies, we are able to feasibly develop multiple clinical-stage product candidates in parallel, resulting in a more diversified portfolio that provides multiple opportunities to create value.

• | Establish global commercial organization. We have established our own unique commercial organization in major pharmaceutical markets and developed a network of third-party distributors in smaller markets and expect to expand these efforts. We believe our commercial organization is highly targeted, in part as a result of the relatively small number of specialists who typically treat patients with the diseases to be addressed by our product and product candidates.

 Product - MepseviiTM
 On November 15, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved our first product, Mepsevii (vestronidase alfa), the first medicine approved for the treatment of children and adults with MPS VII, also known as Sly syndrome. Mepsevii is available to patients in the U.S. In order to support patients, we launched UltraCare™, a comprehensive support service that provides ongoing support to patients and caregivers. UltraCare will help patients obtain coverage and assist with financial support for both medication and administration of medication. With this approval, the FDA issued a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher, or PRV, which confers priority review to a subsequent drug application that would not otherwise qualify for priority review. We completed the sale of the PRV in January 2018 for $130.0 million. 
  Mepsevii is an intravenous, or IV, enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of MPS VII. MPS VII is caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase, which is required for the breakdown of certain complex carbohydrates known as glycosaminoglycans, or GAGs. The inability to properly break down GAGs leads to their accumulation in many tissues, resulting in a serious multi-system disease. Mepsevii is designed to replace the deficient lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase in MPS VII patients. Patients with MPS VII suffer from severe cellular and organ dysfunction that typically leads to death in the teens or early adulthood and may have abnormal coarsened facial features, enlargement of the liver and spleen, airway obstruction, lung disease, cardiovascular complications, joint stiffness, short stature, and a skeletal disease known as dysostosis multiplex. In addition, many patients experience progressive lung problems as a result of airway obstruction and mucous production, often leading to sleep apnea and pulmonary insufficiency, and eventually requiring tracheostomy. Mepsevii is the only FDA-approved drug therapy for MPS VII. 
 In Europe, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is currently reviewing the Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for vestronidase alfa, and an opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, is expected in the first half of 2018. The EMA has agreed that approval under exceptional circumstances could be possible based upon a single positive placebo-controlled pivotal study in approximately 12 patients using urinary GAG levels as a surrogate primary endpoint, provided the data was strongly supportive of a favorable benefit/risk ratio and some evidence or trend in improvement in clinical endpoints was observed to support the primary endpoint. The EMA recognized that a statistically significant result on clinical endpoints was unlikely given the small number of patients expected to be enrolled in the study.
 We are also supplying vestronidase alfa to investigators who are treating patients under emergency investigational new drug, or eIND, applications and other expanded access programs. 
 Please see “—License and Collaboration Agreements—Approved Product—Saint Louis University” for a description of our license agreement with Saint Louis University.
 Clinical Product Candidates 
 Our current clinical-stage pipeline consists of three product categories: biologics, small-molecule substrate replacement therapies, and gene therapy. Enzymes are proteins that the body uses to process materials needed for normal cellular function, and substrates are the materials upon which enzymes act. When enzymes or substrates are missing, the body is unable to perform its normal cellular functions, often leading to significant clinical disease. Several of our therapies are intended to replace deficient enzymes or substrates. Gene therapy is a therapeutic approach in which an isolated gene sequence or segment of DNA is administered to a patient, most commonly for the purpose of treating a genetic disease that is caused by mutations. Gene therapy aims to address the disease-causing effects of absent or dysfunctional genes by delivering functional copies of the gene to the patient’s cells, offering the potential for durable therapeutic benefit.

Burosumab for the treatment of XLH 
 Burosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody administered via subcutaneous injection that is designed to bind and reduce the biological activity of fibroblast growth factor 23, or FGF23, to increase abnormally low phosphate levels in patients with XLH. Patients with XLH have low serum phosphate levels due to excessive phosphate loss into the urine, which is directly caused by the effect on kidney function of excess FGF23 production in bone cells. Low phosphate levels lead to poor bone mineralization and a variety of clinical manifestations, including rickets leading to bowing and other skeletal deformities, short stature, bone pain and fractures, and muscle weakness. There is no approved drug therapy or treatment for the underlying cause of XLH. Most patients are managed using frequently dosed oral phosphate replacement and vitamin D therapy, which can lead to significant side effects. Oral phosphate/vitamin D replacement therapy requires extremely close monitoring due to the potential for excessive phosphate levels and secondary increases in calcium, which can result in severe damage to the kidneys from excess calcium phosphate deposits and other complications. Additionally, some patients are unable to tolerate the regimen due to the chalky stool that results from taking large amounts of oral phosphate or the high frequency of dosing required. 
 In April 2017, we announced positive 64-week data from a 52-patient pediatric Phase 2 randomized, multicenter, open-label, dose-finding study of burosumab for the treatment of XLH in children aged five to 12 years of age. Patients demonstrated increases in mean serum phosphorus, renal phosphate reabsorption (TmP/GFR) and serum 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D levels through 64 weeks of treatment. Rickets severity was assessed using the RSS scoring system. There was a statistically significant improvement in rickets scores in all groups at 64 weeks, with the greatest improvements in patients with higher baseline rickets scores (RSS ≥1.5) who received bi-weekly dosing of burosumab. Overall, patients (n=52) had a 51% reduction in RSS score (p < 0.0001). Patients with higher baseline rickets scores (n=34) had a 59% reduction in RSS score (p < 0.0001). Patients who were dosed bi-weekly (n=26) had a 58% reduction in RSS score (p < 0.0001). Patients with higher baseline rickets scores who were dosed bi-weekly (n=17) had a 62% reduction in RSS score (p < 0.0001). The change in the severity of rickets was assessed by the RGI-C score. Data show significant improvement in rickets in all groups at 64 weeks. Overall, all patients (n=52) experienced a mean improvement in RGI-C score of 
 6


+1.57 (p< 0. 0001) and those patients with higher baseline rickets scores (n=34) experienced a mean improvement of +1.98 (p< 0.0001). Within the higher severity subset, 77% (26/34) experienced substantial healing (score > 2). Overall, all patients who were dosed bi-weekly (n=26) experienced a mean improvement in RGI-C score of +1.62 (p< 0.0001). Patients with higher baseline rickets scores who were dosed bi-weekly (n=17) showed a mean improvement of +2.08 (p< 0.0001) (substantial healing), and 82% experienced substantial healing (score > 2). Patients with higher baseline rickets scores showed more growth impairment (baseline height percentile= 5.84), and these patients demonstrated greater improvement in growth. Among all patients (n=52), growth velocity improved by a mean of +0.55 cm/year (p=0.0376), and there was 0.15 change in height z-score (p<0.0001). Patients with higher baseline rickets scores had a +0.86 cm/year improvement in growth velocity (p=0.0175) and a 0.17 change in height z-score (p=0.0016). Patients who were dosed bi-weekly (n=26) experienced a +0.73 cm/year change in growth velocity (p=0.0160) and a 0.18 change in height z-score (p=0.0002). Patients with higher baseline rickets scores who were dosed bi-weekly (n=17) had a +1.11 cm/year change in growth velocity (p=0.0076) and a 0.18 change in height z-score (p=0.0063). Approximately 65% of patients had injection site reactions, all of which were considered mild. There was one previously reported serious adverse event considered possibly treatment-related. This was a patient with fever and muscle pain who improved without complication and is still in the study. There have been no deaths or discontinuations from the study. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in mean serum calcium, urinary calcium and in serum intact parathyroid hormone. None of the patients had serum phosphorus levels above the upper limit of normal at any time point. No clinically significant changes were observed in renal ultrasounds pre- and post-treatment. 
 In September 2017 we announced 40-week data from the 64-week Phase 2 study in children less than five years old (mean age 2.9 years). Burosumab increased mean serum phosphorus levels by 1.2 mg/dL into the low normal range after one week of treatment and these levels were maintained through week 40 with 77% of children achieving normal serum phosphorus levels at week 40. Serum 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D levels were also increased from baseline to week 40. Rickets severity was assessed using the RSS scoring system. The mean total RSS score improved significantly (59% reduction) at week 40 (p<0.0001). The change in rickets severity was also assessed at week 40 by the RGI-C score which showed substantial healing (RGIC score > 2) in all patients (p<0.0001). Burosumab treatment also resulted in significantly improved bowing as determined by RGI-C lower limb deformity (p<0.0001). Additionally, mean levels of alkaline phosphatase were significantly reduced (-39%, p<0.0001) in these patients at week 40. All patients experienced one or more adverse events. There was one serious adverse event of a tooth abscess that was considered unrelated to burosumab treatment. All other events were assessed as mild or moderate in severity except for a Grade 3 food allergy that was considered unrelated to burosumab treatment. Three patients had injection site reactions and four patients experienced hypersensitivity events that were all mild and considered unrelated to burosumab treatment. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in mean serum calcium, urinary calcium and in serum intact parathyroid hormone. There have been no events of hyperphosphatemia and there have been no deaths or discontinuations from the study.
 In February 2018, we reported continued improvement in rickets and bowing in 64 week data from this Phase 2 study. This longer term data from this study demonstrated that treatment with burosumab was consistent with and further improved from what was seen at 40 weeks. These included sustained improvements in serum phosphorus levels, and a progressive reduction into the normal range of alkaline phosphatase. There were continued improvements in bowing and rickets scores at 64 weeks. The safety profile observed in this study was consistent with other burosumab studies.
 In December 2017, we and our partners Kyowa Kirin International PLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of KHK, announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) scientific committee, adopted a Positive Opinion recommending the conditional marketing authorization of burosumab for the treatment of XLH with radiographic evidence of bone disease in children one year of age and older and adolescents with growing skeletons. The CHMP's recommendation has been referred to the European Commission (EC), which is expected to render its final decision in February of 2018.
 We have an ongoing Phase 3 randomized open-label clinical study comparing the efficacy and safety of burosumab to oral phosphate and active vitamin D therapy in approximately 60 pediatric patients with XLH. The study is evaluating changes in rickets, growth velocity and height, pharmacodynamic assessments, walking ability, patient reported outcomes assessing pain, fatigue and physical function, and safety. We expect data from this study in the second half of 2018. This study will not be required to support a US approval and will serve as a confirmatory study in Europe.
 We are also continuing to develop burosumab in adults with XLH. In April 2017, we announced positive 24-week data from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of burosumab in adults with X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH). The study enrolled 134 patients, randomized 1:1 to burosumab at a dose of 1 mg/kg or placebo every four weeks for 24 weeks. The study met the primary endpoint of increasing serum phosphorus levels as 94% of patients treated with burosumab (n=68) achieved serum phosphorus levels above the lower limit of normal and maintained levels in the low normal range through 24 weeks, compared to 8% in the placebo arm (n=66; p<0.0001). There were three pre-specified key secondary endpoints, including stiffness and physical function, both measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC®), and pain measured by the Brief Pain Inventory Question 3 (BPI Q3; pain at its worst in the last 24 hours). At week 24, stiffness improved by a mean score of 7.87 points for patients treated with burosumab compared to a 0.25 point worsening among patients in the placebo group (mean difference of 8.12; p=0.0122). Physical function improved by 3.11 points for patients treated with burosumab compared to a 1.79 point worsening among patients in the placebo group (mean difference of 4.90 points; p=0.0478). Pain score improved by 0.79 for patients treated with burosumab compared to a 0.32 improvement among patients in the placebo group (mean score difference of 0.46 points; 
 7


p=0.0919). Results were directionally consistent towards improvement across all three key secondary endpoints. After pre-planned multiplicity adjustment, the improvement in stiffness among patients treated with burosumab remained statistically significant at the less than the 0.0167 threshold, while physical function and pain scores demonstrated strong trends. 
 In December 2017, we announced additional positive 48-week data from the study. From 24 to 48 weeks of treatment, 84% of patients who had received burosumab since the beginning of the study (n=68) achieved and maintained serum phosphorus levels above the lower limit of normal (2.5 mg/dL). 89% of patients who crossed over from placebo to burosumab after 24 weeks (n=66) achieved and maintained serum phosphorus levels above the lower limit of normal. Patients treated with burosumab showed continued improvement in stiffness and physical function as measured by WOMAC. For patients treated with burosumab, stiffness further improved from a mean change of 7.42 points at 24 weeks to 16.03 points at 48 weeks. Patients who crossed over from placebo to burosumab treatment had a mean change of 15.82 points from 24 to 48 weeks. Physical function also further improved from a mean change of 2.78 points at 24 weeks to 7.76 points at 48 weeks. For patients in the crossover group, physical function improved by a mean change of 8.18 points from 24 to 48 weeks. Burosumab was associated with a reduction in pain measured by BPI Q3, as well as a reduction in the use of pain medication. For patients treated with burosumab, pain scores further improved from a mean change of 0.81 points at 24 weeks to 1.09 points at 48 weeks. Patients who crossed over from placebo to burosumab treatment had a mean change of 1.18 points from 24 to 48 weeks. The patient frequency of reported opioid use decreased by 76% from 17 patients (25%) at baseline to four patients (6%) at week 48 in the burosumab group, and by 70% from 13 patients (20%) to four patients (6%) in the crossover group. The patient frequency of reported nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use decreased by 72% from 47 patients (69%) at baseline to 13 patients (19%) at week 48 in the burosumab group, and by 74% from 43 patients (65%) to 11 patients (17%) in the crossover group. Burosumab treatment resulted in increased healing of fractures (active fractures and pseudofractures) compared to placebo at week 24, and this improvement continued through 48 weeks. When evaluating follow-up X-rays in the 52% of patients with identified fractures or pseudofractures at baseline, the 43% rate of fracture healing observed at 24 weeks on burosumab increased to 63% at 48 weeks. In the crossover group which had an 8% rate of fracture healing at 24 weeks, the rate increased to 35% at week 48. The crossover patient group fracture healing result was consistent with the effect observed in the first 24 weeks of the burosumab group treatment.
 There was no difference in the overall frequency of treatment emergent serious and non-serious adverse events, treatment related adverse events and serious adverse events between the group who received burosumab for the 48-week period compared to the group who received placebo for the 24-week double-blind period and then crossed over to burosumab. The safety profile at 48 weeks was generally similar to that observed at 24 weeks. The most common adverse events in patients during treatment with burosumab (>10%) were arthralgia (24%), nasopharyngitis (22%), headache (20%), back pain (16%), tooth abscess (13%), fatigue (13%), restless leg syndrome (11%), pain in extremity (11%), pain (11%), toothache (11%), vitamin D deficiency (10%), and musculoskeletal pain (10%). Eleven percent of patients who received burosumab experienced clinical symptoms compatible with hypersensitivity. There were 15 patients who experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) during treatment with burosumab, but none of these SAEs were considered treatment-related. No meaningful changes were observed in serum intact parathyroid hormone levels or ectopic mineralization as assessed by renal ultrasounds or echocardiograms. Of the 134 patients enrolled in the study, one patient in the burosumab arm discontinued treatment during the 24-week double-blind treatment period, as previously reported. During the open-label period, seven patients discontinued treatment. No discontinuations were related to adverse events or tolerability. There has been one non-treatment related death due to a car accident that was reported after the Week 48 data cutoff date.
 In February 2018, we reported that bone biopsy data from adult patients in the bone quality study demonstrated continued improvement in osteomalacia. At 48 weeks, all ten patients with evaluable paired bone biopsies demonstrated meaningful improvements from baseline in mean osteoid volume/bone volume. The mean decrease from 26.1% to 11.2% among these patients represents a 57% improvement from baseline in mean osteoid volume/bone volume which is the gold standard for the evaluation of osteomalacia. The patients also demonstrated mean improvements of 32% and 26% in osteoid thickness and osteoid surface/bone surface parameters respectively. These patients also experienced a meaningful improvement in mineralization lag time. These results, including safety, are consistent with the data provided to the FDA in the first 6 of these 10 patients showing a substantial reduction in osteomalacia.
 In October 2017, we announced that the FDA accepted the biologics license application, or BLA, for burosumab to treat pediatric and adult patients with XLH and has granted Priority Review status. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, action date for the BLA is April 17, 2018. The Agency has indicated that it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the BLA. The FDA previously granted Fast Track Designation to the burosumab program for the treatment of XLH, and Breakthrough Therapy Designation for pediatric patients one year of age or older. The FDA also designated burosumab as a drug for a "rare pediatric disease," enabling issuance of a priority review voucher if burosumab is approved.

Burosumab for the treatment of tumor-induced osteomalacia, or TIO
We are also developing burosumab for the treatment of TIO. TIO results from typically benign tumors that produce excess levels of FGF23, which can lead to severe hypophosphatemia, osteomalacia, bone fractures, fatigue, bone and muscle pain, and muscle weakness. There are cases in which resection of the tumor is not feasible or recurrence of the tumor occurs after resection. In patients for whom the tumor is inoperable, the current standard of care consists of oral phosphate and/or vitamin D replacement. The efficacy of this treatment is often limited, as it does not treat the underlying disease and its benefits must be balanced with monitoring for potential risks such as nephrocalcinosis, hypercalciuria, and hyperparathyroidism. 
 In September 2017, interim data from the open-label Phase 2 study of burosumab in 17 adult patients with TIO was presented. In 16 patients with baseline and week 24 data, mean serum phosphorus, renal phosphate reabsorption (TmP/GFR) and serum 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D levels increased after the first dose and over 24 weeks of treatment. The mean serum phosphorus level entered the normal range within two weeks of treatment, and was maintained in the low normal range through week 24 of treatment. At week 24 there was a statistically significant increase in mean percent change from baseline levels (51% and 38% respectively) of the bone turnover markers, Procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and collagen type 1 cross-linked C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx). All patients had moderate to severe osteomalacia at baseline as assessed by histomorphometric indices of osteomalacia. Four patients who completed 48 weeks of treatment had bone biopsy data. In three of these patients burosumab treatment was associated with improvements in histomorphometric indices of osteomalacia. One patient did not receive burosumab consistently. Burosumab demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in patient reported outcomes. At 24 weeks, patients experienced a statistically significant reduction in all four fatigue parameters as assessed by the Brief Fatigue Inventory, or BFI. Burosumab also demonstrated a statistically significant increase in lower limb strength as seen with the increase in repetitions at 24 weeks in the Sit-to-Stand test (p<0.01). Adverse events occurred in all patients (n=16). Treatment-related adverse events were observed in seven patients (44%), and included, as previously disclosed, Vitamin D deficiency and rash, and dysgeusia, all mild in grade. Most adverse events were grade 1 or 2 and included two patients with injection site reactions and two patients with restless leg syndrome that were previously disclosed. Three patients had a serious adverse event (previously disclosed tumor progression, thoracic epidural tumor compression, and a mesenchymal tumor progression). None of the serious adverse events were considered treatment related and all of these patients had a history of tumor progression at baseline and one patient discontinued to treat their tumor progression. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in mean serum calcium, urinary calcium and in serum intact parathyroid hormone. We expect 48-week data from this study in the first half of 2018.

 UX007 for the treatment of LC-FAOD 
 We are developing UX007 for oral administration intended as a substrate replacement therapy for patients with LC-FAOD. UX007 is a purified, pharmaceutical-grade form of triheptanoin, a specially designed synthetic triglyceride compound, created via a multi-step chemical process. Triheptanoin has been studied clinically for over a decade in more than a hundred human subjects affected by a variety of diseases. UX007 is a medium odd-chain triglyceride of seven-carbon fatty acids designed to provide substrate replacement for fatty acid metabolism and restore production of energy. Patients with LC-FAOD have a deficiency that impairs the ability to produce energy from fat, which can lead to depletion of glucose in the body, and severe liver, muscle, and heart disease, as well as death. There are currently no approved drugs or treatments specifically for LC-FAOD. The current standard of care for LC-FAOD includes diligent prevention of fasting combined with the use of low-fat/high-carbohydrate diets, carnitine supplementation in some cases, and medium even-chain triglyceride oil supplementation. Despite treatment with the current standard of care, many patients continue to suffer significant morbidity and mortality. 
 In November 2016, we reported positive 78-week data from the Phase 2 study in LC-FAOD patients. The study was single-arm open-label and evaluated 29 pediatric and adult patients across three main symptom groups (musculoskeletal, liver/hypoglycemia, and cardiac). Patients needed to have moderate to severe LC-FAOD with significant disease in at least one of these domains or a frequent medical events history in order to enroll. The study began with a four-week run-in period to assess baseline data while on the standard of care therapy including MCT oil, if applicable. Patients on MCT oil then discontinued it and UX007 was titrated to a target dose of 25-35% of total daily caloric intake. Patients were followed to evaluate the acute effects of UX007 treatment over 24 weeks on several endpoints, including cycle ergometry performance, 12-minute walk test, liver disease/hypoglycemia, cardiac disease, and quality of life. Patients who opted to continue were treated for a total of 78 weeks, and rates of major medical events, such as rhabdomyolysis, hypoglycemia and cardiac events, were monitored and compared to rates for the two years prior to treatment with UX007. The study evaluated the safety and tolerability of UX007. The data showed a 48.1% reduction in the mean annualized rate of MCEs (Major Clinical Events) and a 50.6% reduction in the median annualized rate of MCEs after 78 weeks of treatment, compared to the annualized rates in the 18 months prior to treatment with UX007. There was a 50.3% reduction in the mean annualized duration of all MCEs and a 76.7% reduction in the median annualized duration of MCEs following 78 weeks of UX007 treatment. The safety profile was consistent with what has been previously observed with UX007.

In January 2018, we announced an update to our development plan for UX007 in LC-FAOD. Following an end-of-phase 2 meeting, we are working to provide additional information to submit to FDA for consideration of an early filing based on the results from the Phase 2 study.
 The clinical effect observed was considered important, but it was not clear if there were dietary or other changes in the regimen as each patient crossed over onto UX007 that might have accounted for the improvement. We are working to provide additional information to FDA to support that the improvement demonstrated was likely due to UX007 and not any other changes. After this information is submitted and evaluated by FDA, we plan to determine with the FDA whether an early submission could be pursued. We are simultaneously finalizing a full protocol for a Phase 3, randomized, controlled study examining major clinical events as the primary endpoint as discussed with the FDA. This study would provide additional information that would be important in utilization and reimbursement long-term for UX007. If the FDA agrees to an early submission based on the Phase 2 study, the Phase 3 study would serve as a post-approval commitment for label expansion. Alternatively, the Phase 3 study could serve as a registrational study if an early filing is not possible.

 UX007 for the treatment of Glut1 DS
 We are also developing UX007 for patients with Glut1 DS. Glut1 DS is caused by a mutation affecting the gene that codes for Glut1, which is a protein that transports glucose from the blood into the brain. Because glucose is the primary source of energy for the brain, Glut1 DS results in a chronic state of brain energy deficiency and is characterized by seizures, developmental delay, and movement disorder. There are currently no approved drugs specific to Glut1 DS. The current standard of care for Glut1 DS is the ketogenic diet, an extreme high-fat (70-80% of daily calories as fat)/low-carbohydrate diet, which generates ketone bodies as an alternative energy source to glucose, and one or more antiepileptic drugs. The ketogenic diet can be effective in reducing seizures but compliance can be difficult, and the effectiveness of the diet in the treatment of developmental delay and movement disorders has not been confirmed. In addition, ketogenic diet can lead to side effects including renal stones. In general, Glut1 DS patients are considered relatively refractory to antiepileptic drugs with only approximately 8% achieving seizure control on antiepileptic drugs alone. There are currently no antiepileptic drugs approved specifically for patients with Glut1 DS.UX007 is intended as a substrate replacement therapy to provide an alternative source of energy to the brain in Glut1 DS patients.
 In March 2017, we announced topline data from the Phase 2 global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical study of UX007 for the treatment of Glut1DS patients with seizures. The study enrolled 36 patients who were not fully compliant with ketogenic diet and continued to have seizures. Patients treated with UX007 (n=25) demonstrated a reduction of 13.4% in overall seizure frequency (p=0.41) relative to placebo (n=11), which did not meet the primary endpoint of reducing the frequency of total number of observable and absence seizures among patients treated from baseline to Week 8 with UX007 compared to placebo. Two of the 36 enrolled patients discontinued treatment during the eight-week placebo-controlled period, and 12 patients have discontinued during the extension period to date. Two patients discontinued due to adverse events, four patients due to tolerability reasons, and eight patients due to compliance or study burden issues. There were no deaths, and no treatment-related serious adverse events. During the placebo-controlled period, 18 patients (72%) in the UX007 arm had treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and five patients (45%) in the placebo arm had treatment-related AEs. Most AEs were mild-to-moderate GI events including vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. 
 In April 2017, we screened the first patient in the Phase 3 study of UX007 for the treatment of Glut1 DS patients with the movement disorder phenotype. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of UX007 in approximately 40 patients who are experiencing disabling paroxysmal movement disorders associated with Glut1 DS. Movement disorder events are defined as disabling if they affect or limit a patient's ability to perform activities of daily living. Eligible patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment sequences. Patients in the first group will begin a two-week titration period followed by an eight-week treatment period on UX007. Patients will then begin a 2-week washout period, followed by a 2-week titration period and 8-week period on placebo. Patients in the second group will follow the same schedule but will start with placebo and then cross over to UX007. The primary endpoint compares the frequency of disabling paroxysmal movement disorder events during the 8-week treatment period with UX007, to the frequency of disabling movement disorder events during the 8-week placebo treatment period as recorded by a daily electronic diary. Secondary endpoints include the duration of disabling paroxysmal movement disorder events; walking capacity and endurance measured by the 12-minute walk test; patient-reported health-related quality of life assessments of physical function, mobility, upper extremity function, fatigue and pain; cognitive function and safety. Following the 22-week blinded crossover study period, patients may roll into the open-label extension period to continue on UX007 treatment. We expect data from this study in the second half of 2018.
 DTX301 for the treatment of OTC deficiency

 We are developing DTX301 as an adeno-associated virus 8, orAAV8, gene therapy product candidate designed for patients with ornithine transcarbamylase, or OTC, deficiency. OTC is part of the urea cycle, an enzymatic pathway in the liver that converts excess nitrogen, in the form of ammonia, to urea for excretion. OTC deficiency is the most common urea cycle disorder and leads to 
 10


increased levels of ammonia. Patients with OTC deficiency suffer from acute hyperammonemic episodes that can lead to hospitalization, adverse cognitive and neurological effects, and death. We estimate that there are approximately 10,000 patients worldwide with OTC deficiency, of which we estimate approximately 80% are classified as late-onset, our target population. We initiated patient dosing in our Phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial of DTX301 in August 2017. DTX301 has received Orphan Drug Designation in both the United States and Europe and Fast Track Designation in the United States. 
 In January 2018, we announced positive interim safety and efficacy data from the first dose cohort of the Phase 1/2 study of DTX301 in OTC deficiency. All three patients in the first, lowest-dose cohort received a single DTX301 dose of 2.0 × 10^12 GC/kg. As of the December 22, 2017 data cutoff date, two of the three patients had been followed for at least 12 weeks, the pre-defined endpoint for efficacy evaluation, and the third patient had been followed for 6 weeks. As of the cutoff date, there were no infusion-related adverse events and no serious adverse events reported. All adverse events were Grade 1 or 2 and resolved. The only treatment-related adverse events were mild, clinically asymptomatic and manageable elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in two patients, peaking at 45 (Patient 1) and 118 IU/L (Patient 2). These ALT elevations were mild and similar to what has been observed in other programs using AAV gene therapy. Both patients completed a standard tapering course of corticosteroids to treat the ALT elevations, and as of the data cutoff date, their ALT levels were in the normal range (below 40 U/L). The third patient had ALTs that remained in the normal range through six weeks. The first patient's rate of ureagenesis was normalized and maintained over 12 weeks. Their rate of ureagenesis at baseline was 200 umol/kg/hr (67% of normal, defined as 300 umol/kg/hr). At 6 weeks, their rate of ureagenesis increased to 335 umol/kg/hr (67% increase from baseline, 112% of normal). At 12 weeks, their rate of ureagenesis was 261 umol/kg/hr (30% increase from baseline, 87% of normal). The second patient did not show a clinically meaningful change in rate of ureagenesis over the 12-week period. The third patient showed a modest increase in ureagenesis from baseline over the first six weeks of treatment. This patient has not yet reached the 12-week post-dosing point. Full 12-week data from the first cohort is expected in March 2018. We expect to be able to move to the higher-dose second cohort (6.0 x 10^12 GC/kg) pending the data monitoring committee's review of the 12-week safety data for all three patients in this cohort. Data from this second cohort should be available in the second half of 2018.

 Other Development
 In August 2017, we announced that a Phase 3 study evaluating aceneuramic acid extended release, or Ace-ER, in patients with GNE Myopathy did not achieve its primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant difference in the upper extremity muscle strength composite score compared to placebo. The study also did not meet its key secondary endpoints. Adverse events were generally balanced between Ace-ER and placebo and safety was consistent with previously released Ace-ER data. We are discontinuing further clinical development of Ace-ER.
Preclinical Pipeline 
 DTX401 for the treatment of GSDIa
 DTX401 is our AAV8 gene therapy program for the treatment of patients with GSDIa, a disease that arises from a defect in G6Pase, an essential enzyme in glycogen and glucose metabolism. GSDIa is the most common glycogen storage disease and we estimate there are approximately 6,000 patients worldwide. We expect to submit an IND in the first half of 2018 and expect data from the first cohort of the Phase 1/2 study in the second half of 2018. DTX401 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the United States and Europe. 
 DTX201 for the treatment of Hemophilia A
 DTX201 is our FVIII gene therapy program for the treatment of hemophilia A that we are developing in collaboration with Bayer Healthcare LLC, or Bayer. Hemophilia A is the most common form of hemophilia with approximately 144,000 patients worldwide. We expect to submit an IND for DTX201 in the second half of 2018. 
 rhPPCA (UX004) for the treatment of galactosialidosis
 Recombinant human protective protein cathepsin-A, or rhPPCA, which we in-licensed from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, or St. Jude, in September 2012, is in preclinical development as an enzyme replacement therapy for galactosialidosis, a rare lysosomal storage disease for which there are no currently approved drug therapies. Similar to MPS patients, patients with galactosialidosis present with both soft tissue storage in the liver, spleen, and other tissues, as well as connective tissue (bone and cartilage) related disease. As with MPS VII, an enzyme deficiency results in accumulation of substrates in the lysosomes, causing skeletal and organ dysfunction, and death. We are continuing preclinical development of rhPPCA. Please see “—License and Collaboration Agreements—Preclinical Product Candidates—St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital” for a description of our license agreement with St. Jude.

UX068 for the treatment of creatine transporter deficiency (CTD)
 UX068 is in preclinical development for the treatment of CTD, an X-linked recessive disorder due to mutations in the SLC6A8 gene. Patients with CTD can suffer from CNS deficits, seizures, progressive intellectual disability, autism, speech/language/gross motor delays, and muscle hypotonia and hypotrophy. CTD affects approximately 10,000 to 50,000 patients in developed world.
 Collaboration with Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc. for mRNA therapeutics including UX053 for the treatment of glycogen storage disease type III (GSDIII) 
 We signed a research collaboration and license agreement with Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc. to develop mRNA therapeutics for select rare disease targets in October 2015. The Arcturus collaboration may help us address a wider range of rare diseases than possible with current approaches. As part of the collaboration, Arcturus will utilize its UNA Oligomer™ chemistry and LUNAR™ nanoparticle delivery platform to initially design and optimize mRNA therapeutics for two targets selected by us; we also have the option to add up to eight additional targets during the collaborative research period. 
 The collaboration includes preclinical candidate UX053 for the treatment of GSDIII, a disease caused by a glycogen debranching enzyme (AGL) deficiency that results in glycogen accumulation in the liver and muscle. GSDIII can cause hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, some progressive liver cirrhosis, and muscle disease later in life, and affects more than 10,000 patients worldwide. 
 Collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited
 We entered into a strategic partnership with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, to develop and commercialize therapies to treat rare genetic diseases in June 2016. As part of the collaboration, we received an exclusive license to one preclinical Takeda product candidate in a pre-determined field of use. We discontinued the development efforts on the pre-clinical compound in the pre-determined field of use. We have also established a five-year research collaboration with Takeda in which we will have the option to license up to five additional Takeda product candidates for rare diseases; accordingly, we continue to evaluate additional product candidates for potential addition to the collaboration. Please see “—License and Collaboration Agreements—Preclinical Product Candidates—Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited” for a description of our license agreement with Takeda.
 Other preclinical programs
 We continue to work on other compounds in various preclinical stages of development. 
 Competition 
 The commercialization of new drugs is competitive, and we may face worldwide competition from individual investigators, major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, nutraceutical companies, and ultimately biosimilar and generic companies. Our competitors may develop or market therapies that are more effective, safer, or less costly than any that may be commercialized by us, or may obtain regulatory approval for their therapies more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. 
 The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive, and a number of more established companies, which have acknowledged strategies to license or acquire products, may have competitive advantages as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product acquisitions. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash flows, and institutional experience. 
 With respect to burosumab, although we are not aware of any other products currently in clinical development for the treatment of XLH, it is possible that competitors may produce, develop, and commercialize therapeutics, or utilize other approaches such as gene therapy, to treat XLH. Most pediatric patients with XLH are managed using oral phosphate replacement and/or vitamin D therapy, which is relatively inexpensive and therefore may adversely affect our ability to commercialize burosumab, if approved, in some countries. 
 With respect to Mepsevii, we are not aware of any other compounds currently in clinical development for MPS VII, but it is possible that other companies may produce, develop, and commercialize compounds that might treat these diseases. Additionally, gene therapy and other therapeutic approaches may emerge for the treatment of lysosomal diseases. Bone marrow or stem cell transplants have also been used in MPS VII and in other lysosomal storage diseases and represent a potential competing therapy. Stem cell transplants have been effective in treating soft tissue storage and in having an impact on brain disease, but have not to date proven effective in treating bone and connective tissue disease. Typically, enzyme replacement therapy has had an impact on bone and connective tissue disease in other disorders when patients were treated early.

With respect to UX007/triheptanoin, there are currently no approved drugs or treatments for patients with LC-FAOD or Glut1 DS. LC-FAOD is commonly treated with diet therapy and MCT oil, and UX007 would compete with MCT oil. Glut1 DS is commonly treated with ketogenic diet and antiepileptic drugs. UX007 may compete with these approaches. Although we believe that UX007 should be considered a drug and will be regulated that way, it is possible that other companies or individuals may attempt to produce triheptanoin for use in LC-FAOD, Glut1 DS, and other patients by attempting to sell the product via a nutritional supplement or medical food pathway. Investigators are testing triheptanoin in clinical studies across multiple indications, including LC-FAOD and Glut1 DS. For example, B. Braun Medical Inc., or B. Braun, has applied for and received orphan drug designation for triheptanoin for the treatment of certain types of LC-FAOD in Europe; however, we are not aware of any ongoing clinical development activities by B. Braun. It is also possible that other companies may produce, develop, and commercialize other medium odd-chain fatty acids, or completely different compounds, to treat LC-FAOD and Glut1 DS. Other companies may also utilize other approaches, such as gene therapy, to treat LC-FAOD and Glut1 DS. 
 With respect to DTX301, the current treatments for patients with OTC deficiency are nitrogen scavenging drugs and severe limitations in dietary protein. Drug therapy includes sodium phenylbutyrate (Buphenyl) and glycerol phenylbutyrate (Ravicti), both nitrogen scavengers that help eliminate excess nitrogen, in the form of ammonia, by facilitating its excretion. During a metabolic crisis, patients routinely receive carbohydrate and lipid rich nutrition, including overnight feeding through a nasogastric tube, to limit bodily protein breakdown and ammonia production. In acute cases, ammonia must be removed by dialysis or hemofiltration. Liver transplant may also be a solution for OTC deficiency.
 Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we have. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy. 
 License and Collaboration Agreements 
 Our product and current product candidate pipeline have been either in-licensed from academic institutions or derived from partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies. Following is a description of our significant license and collaboration agreements.
Approved Product
 Saint Louis University
In November 2010, we entered into a license agreement with Saint Louis University, or SLU, wherein SLU granted us certain exclusive rights to intellectual property related to GUS. Under the terms of the license agreement, SLU granted us an exclusive worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, and sell therapeutics related to SLU’s beta-glucuronidase product, such as our rhGUS product candidate, for use in the treatment of human diseases. Under this agreement, we agreed to use best efforts to develop and commercialize a licensed product as soon as practicable consistent with sound and reasonable business practices and judgment. 
 Under the license agreement, upon reaching a certain level of worldwide sales of the product, we will pay to SLU a low single-digit royalty on net sales of the licensed products in any country or region, subject to certain potential deductions. Our obligation to pay royalties to SLU continues on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent covering the product in such country or, in the United States, Japan, and the EU, until the later expiration of any orphan drug exclusivity. We may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time and SLU may terminate the agreement for our material breach, bankruptcy, or challenge of the licensed patents or technology, and SLU may terminate the agreement or render our license non-exclusive if we fail to meet our diligence obligations. Unless terminated as set forth above, this license agreement continues in full force and effect until the latest of expiration of the last patent based on technology licensed under the agreement, at which point our license becomes fully paid.

Clinical Product Candidates
 Kyowa Hakko Kirin 
 In August 2013, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with KHK. Under the terms of this collaboration and license agreement, as amended, we and KHK will collaborate on the development and commercialization of certain products containing burosumab in the field of orphan diseases in the United States and Canada, or the “profit-share territory”, and in the European Union and Switzerland, or the European territory, and we will have the right to develop and commercialize such products in the field of orphan diseases in Mexico and Central and South America, or Latin America. In the field of orphan diseases, and except for ongoing studies being conducted by KHK, we will be the lead party for development activities in the profit-share territory and in the European territory until the applicable transition date; we will also be the lead party for core development activities conducted in Japan and Korea for which the core development plan is limited to clinical trials mutually agreed to by us and KHK. We will share the costs for development activities in the profit share territory and European territory conducted pursuant to the development plan before the applicable transition date equally with KHK and KHK shall be responsible for 100% of the costs for development activities in Japan and Korea. On the applicable transition date in the profit-share territory and the European territory, KHK will become the lead party and be responsible for the costs of the development activities. However, we will continue to share the costs of the studies commenced prior to the applicable transition date equally with KHK. We have the primary responsibility for conducting certain research and development activities. We are obligated to provide assistance in accordance with the agreed upon development plan as well as participate on various committees. If burosumab is approved, we and KHK will share commercial responsibilities and profits in the profit share territory until the applicable transition date, KHK will commercialize burosumab in the European territory, and we will develop and commercialize burosumab in Latin America. KHK will manufacture and supply burosumab for clinical use globally and will manufacture and supply burosumab for commercial use in the profit share territory and Latin America. 
 In the profit share territory, KHK will book sales of products and we will have the sole right to promote the products for a specified period of time, with KHK increasingly participating in the promotion of the products until five years from commercial launch, after which KHK will have the sole right to promote the products, subject to a limited promotion right retained by us. In the European territory, KHK will book sales of products and have the sole right to promote and sell the products. In Latin America, we will book sales of products and have the sole right to promote and sell the products. 
 KHK will supply all quantities of product for clinical studies. KHK will also supply all quantities of product for commercial sales in the profit-share territory and in Latin America. The supply price to us for commercial sales in the profit-share territory and in Latin America will be determined based on a fixed double-digit percentage of net sales. 
 The remaining profit or loss from commercializing products in the profit-share territory, until the applicable transition date, will be shared between us and KHK on a 50/50 basis. Thereafter, we will be entitled to receive a tiered double-digit revenue share in the mid-to-high 20% range in the profit share territory, intended to approximate the profit share. We will also be entitled to receive a royalty of up to 10% on net sales in the European territory. In Latin America, we will pay to KHK a low single-digit royalty on net sales. Our and KHK’s obligations to pay royalties will continue on a country-by-country basis for so long as we or KHK, as applicable, are selling products in such country. 
 In May 2017, we signed an agreement with a wholly-owned subsidiary of KHK pursuant to which we were granted the right to commercialize burosumab in Turkey. KHK’s subsidiary has the option to assume responsibility for commercialization efforts from us, after a certain minimum period.  
The collaboration and license agreement will continue for as long as products in the field of orphan diseases are sold in the profit-share territory, European territory, Turkey, or Latin America, unless the agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. 
 KHK may terminate the agreement in certain countries or territories based upon our failure to meet certain milestones. Specifically, if we do not obtain U.S. or European marketing approval of burosumab for the treatment of XLH by a certain date, or make a first commercial sale, on a country-by-country basis, in Latin America by certain deadlines, KHK may terminate the agreement only with respect to the applicable territory or country in which the milestone was not timely met. In certain circumstances, we have the right to obtain an extension of the applicable deadline by making a payment to KHK in the low single-digit to low double-digit millions of dollars, depending on the milestone. Also, in the event of the occurrence of certain excusable delays, the deadline for meeting the applicable milestone above is extended to account for the period of the delay. Furthermore, either party may terminate the agreement for the material breach or bankruptcy of the other party. In any event of termination by KHK, unless such termination is the result of KHK’s termination for certain types of breach of the agreement by us, we may receive low single-digit to low double-digit royalties on net post-termination sales by KHK in one or more countries or territories, the amount of which varies depending on the timing of, and reason for, such termination. In any event of termination, our rights to burosumab under the agreement and our obligations to share development costs will cease, and the program will revert to KHK, worldwide if the agreement is terminated as a whole or solely in the terminated countries if the agreement is terminated solely with respect to certain countries.

If the 2015 option and license agreement is terminated with respect to an indication, we grant certain rights to REGENX, including transferring ownership of any applicable regulatory approvals and granting an exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property for use with respect to products covered by the intellectual property we had licensed from REGENX in that indication.
 Preclinical Product Candidates
 St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital 
 In September 2012, we entered into a license agreement with St. Jude wherein St. Jude granted us certain exclusive rights to intellectual property related to rhPPCA. Under the terms of the license agreement, St. Jude granted us an exclusive license under certain know-how to research, develop, make, use, offer to sell, import, and otherwise commercialize and exploit certain PPCA protein products to treat, prevent, and/or diagnose galactosialidosis and other monogenetic diseases. We agreed to make commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product. 
 Under the license agreement, we will pay to St. Jude a royalty of less than 1% on net sales of these products for so long as such products retain orphan drug exclusivity, on a country-by-country basis. We may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time and St. Jude may terminate the agreement for our material breach of the agreement. Unless terminated by its terms, this license agreement continues in full force and effect, until our royalty obligations expire, at which point our license becomes irrevocable, perpetual, fully paid, and royalty-free. 
 Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited
 In June 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Takeda. Under the terms of the license agreement, we obtained, among other things, an exclusive license for a pre-clinical compound from Takeda in a pre-determined field of use, which includes an option to an additional field of use for this product. We are responsible for the development costs for the pre-clinical compound pursuant to an initial development plan. 
 As part of the agreement, we established a five-year research collaboration with Takeda whereby the parties may mutually agree to add additional option products candidates to the collaboration, in which case we will bear the cost of the development activities, with certain exceptions, and terms to be negotiated
 We also granted Takeda an exclusive option for Asian rights, for a limited period, to any licensed products and any additional products resulting from the collaboration, as well as an option to exclusively license one of our products for development and commercialization in Japan. If Takeda exercises any of its option rights to license a product pursuant to the agreement, Takeda will pay for the development costs within the licensed territory, will share in a portion of the global development costs, and will make a milestone payment upon regulatory approval. Takeda will also owe royalties on net sales in the licensed territory for any licensed product, depending on the development stage when the product is licensed as well as sales levels. The royalties related to the option to license our product, as well as the additional product are subject to future good faith negotiations at the time that the option is exercised.
 We discontinued the development efforts on the pre-clinical compound in the pre-determined field of use. We continue to evaluate additional product candidates for potential addition to the collaboration.

Bayer
 In June 2014, we entered into an agreement with Bayer to research, develop and commercialize AAV gene therapy products for treatment of hemophilia A. Under this agreement, we granted Bayer an exclusive license to develop and commercialize one or more novel gene therapies for hemophilia A. We are responsible for the development of DTX201 through a proof-of-concept clinical trial, with reimbursement from Bayer for project costs. Bayer is responsible operationally, including for conducting the proof-of-concept clinical trial, and will incur the costs of the conduct of the trial. Upon the successful demonstration of clinical proof of concept, Bayer agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to manage and fund any subsequent clinical trials and commercialization of gene therapy products for treatment of hemophilia A. Bayer will have worldwide rights to commercialize the potential future product.
 Under the agreement, Bayer paid us an upfront cash payment and will pay us development and commercialization milestone payments, and tiered royalties based on product sales. The agreement expires on a licensed treatment-by-licensed treatment and country-by-country basis until the later of ten years from the date of first commercial sale or when patent claims have expired, lapsed, been abandoned, or been invalidated in such country. Either party may terminate the agreement for an uncured material breach by the other party. Bayer may terminate the agreement upon prior notice to us, either in its entirety or with respect to certain territories subject to the agreement. Bayer may also terminate the agreement upon notice of a product’s failure to meet certain criteria or after the successful completion of certain Phase I trials in the event Bayer makes a good faith determination that there is a material safety issue with respect to such product. Either party may terminate the agreement upon bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party, and we may terminate the agreement if Bayer institutes certain actions. Under certain termination circumstances, we would have worldwide rights to the terminated program(s). 
 University of Pennsylvania
 In January 2015, we entered into an agreement with the University of Pennsylvania to sponsor certain research of Dr. Wilson at University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine related to liver gene therapy and hemophilia. Under the agreement, the University of Pennsylvania granted us an option to obtain a worldwide, non-exclusive or exclusive, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, under certain patent rights conceived, created or reduced to practice in the conduct of the research. We are required to reimburse the University of Pennsylvania for filing, prosecuting and maintaining such patent rights unless and until we decline to exercise our option. The University is required to provide us with task-based, scientific reports of progress and results of the research, and granted us a royalty-free, nontransferable, non-exclusive right to copy and distribute any research reports furnished to us for any reasonable purpose, provided the results are not made publicly available until certain conditions are met, and the right to use, disclose and otherwise exploit the research results for any reasonable purpose, subject to similar restrictions on our public disclosure of the research results. 
 This agreement expired on December 31, 2017, but ongoing mutual commitments extend into 2018. The agreement may be extended further, or renewed, by mutual agreement. If extended or renewed, then either party may terminate the agreement if Dr. Wilson becomes unavailable and an acceptable substitute is not found within a certain period of time, or if we fail to mutually agree on an acceptable work plan and budget for the sponsored research. We may also terminate the sponsored research agreement upon written notice, as long as we have met all of our payment and performance obligations. Either party may terminate this agreement for an uncured material breach. In the event of termination, we shall pay University of Pennsylvania the amount needed to cover costs through the effective termination date as well as allowable commitments extending beyond the termination date (up to one-fourth of the total budget). 
 In May 2016, we entered into a research, collaboration and license agreement with the University of Pennsylvania under which we are collaborating on the pre-clinical development of gene therapy products for the treatment of citrullinemia type I, phenylketonuria, and Wilson disease, each, a Subfield. Under the agreement, we were granted an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing right and license to certain patent rights arising out of the research program, and a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing right and license to certain University of Pennsylvania intellectual property, in each case to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, commercialize and import licensed products in each Subfield for the term of the agreement. We will fund the cost of the research program and will be responsible for clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization of each Subfield. In addition, we will be required to make milestone payments (up to a maximum of $5 million per Subfield) if certain development milestones are achieved over time, and to pay low to mid single-digit royalties on net sales of each Subfield’s licensed products. We will also make milestone payments per approved product if certain commercial milestones are achieved.

Patents and Proprietary Rights 
 The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product, product candidates, processes, and know-how are important to our business. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our product, product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product, product candidates, and other technology. Our policy is to patent or in-license the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. In addition to patent protection, we intend to use other means to protect our proprietary rights, including pursuing marketing or data exclusivity periods, orphan drug status, and similar rights that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries, including the United States, Europe, Japan, and China. See “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Orphan Designation and Exclusivity,” “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity,” “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Patent Term Restoration,” “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Biosimilars and Exclusivity,” “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs and New Chemical Entity Exclusivity,” and “Government Regulation—European Union Regulation — Orphan Designation and Exclusivity” below for additional information. 
 We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. 
 We seek regulatory approval for our product candidates in disease areas with high unmet medical need, significant market potential, and where we expect to have a proprietary position through patents covering various aspects of our product candidates, such as composition, dosage, formulation, use, and manufacturing process, among others. Our success depends in part on an intellectual property portfolio that supports our future revenue streams and erects barriers to our competitors. We are maintaining and building our patent portfolio by filing new patent applications, prosecuting existing applications, and licensing and acquiring new patents and patent applications. 
 Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to achieve or maintain market exclusivity or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. For more information, please see “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
 We own or license a number of patents in the U.S. and foreign countries that cover our product, product candidates, or methods of their use. With respect to our owned or in-licensed issued patents in the U.S. and Europe, we may be entitled to obtain a patent term extension to extend the patent expiration date. For example, in the U.S., we can apply for a patent term extension of up to five years for one of the patents covering a product once the product is approved by the FDA, although the restoration period may not exceed 14 years following FDA approval of the product candidate. The exact duration of the extension depends on the time we spend in clinical studies as well as getting marketing approval from the FDA. The exclusivity positions for our commercial product, Mepsevii, and our clinical-stage product candidates as of December 31, 2017 are summarized below.
 Mepsevii (Vestronidase Alfa) Exclusivity
 We own three issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, and corresponding foreign patent applications relating to the vestronidase alfa composition of matter and its use in the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders such as MPS VII. The patents in the U.S. expire in 2035. Any patents issuing from the pending application in the U.S. and the corresponding foreign pending patent applications would be projected to also expire in 2035. Mepsevii is additionally protected in the U.S. by regulatory data exclusivity until 2029 and by orphan drug exclusivity for treating MPS VII until 2024. Outside the U.S., we intend to pursue marketing and orphan drug exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries. In Europe, vestronidase alfa has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of MPS VII. 
Burosumab Exclusivity
 We have in-licensed rights from Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., or KHK, to patents and patent applications relating to burosumab and its use for the treatment of XLH and various other hypophosphatemic conditions. Pursuant to this license, we have rights to a number of issued patents and pending applications, including four U.S. patents and one pending U.S. application, as well as patents and applications in other jurisdictions covering generic and specific antibodies against FGF23 as well as their use for the treatment of XLH and related conditions. The patent terms for the issued patents in the U.S. are from 2022 to 2029 (without patent term extension), while the issued patents outside the U.S. expire between 2021 and 2028 (without patent extension). We also jointly own with KHK a pending application in the U.S. and corresponding foreign patent applications relating to dosing regimens for administration of anti-FGF23 antibodies, including burosumab. Any patents issuing from these jointly-owned applications would be projected to expire in 2035. We intend to pursue marketing and orphan drug exclusivity periods that are available to us under regulatory provisions in certain countries. Burosumab has received orphan drug designation in the U.S. and Europe for the treatment of XLH.  
 18


UX007 Exclusivity
 We are the licensee or owner of patents and patent applications relating to UX007 and its use for a number of diseases including FAOD and Glut1 DS. We have an exclusive license from Baylor Research Institute, or BRI, to issued U.S. patents and pending U.S. patent applications, as well as corresponding foreign patents and applications, relating to the UX007 composition and its uses. In the U.S., the in-licensed BRI patent portfolio includes issued patents with claims covering the UX007 composition that expire between 2020 and 2025 (without patent term extension). The in-licensed BRI portfolio additionally includes an issued U.S. patent with claims covering the use of UX007 for the treatment of FAOD that expires in 2020 (without patent term extension) and an issued U.S. patent with claims covering the use of UX007 for the treatment of various movement disorders associated with Glut1 DS that expires in 2033 (without patent term extension). Outside the U.S., the in-licensed BRI portfolio includes issued patents with claims covering the use of UX007 for the treatment of FAOD that expire in 2020 and pending patent applications with claims covering the use of UX007 for the treatment of Glut1 DS that would expire in 2033 if issued. We also own a pending U.S. patent application and corresponding foreign patent applications relating to our pharmaceutical-grade UX007 composition. Any patents issuing from these owned applications would be projected to expire in 2034. We intend to pursue marketing and orphan drug exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries. UX007 has received orphan designation in the U.S. for FAOD and in Europe for various subtypes of FAOD, while UX007 for the treatment of Glut1 DS has received orphan drug designation in the U.S. and Europe. 
DTX301 Exclusivity
 We have in-licensed patents and patent applications owned by the University of Pennsylvania relating to various adeno-associated viruses and vectors utilizing the capsids of those viruses. These patents and patent applications are licensed or sublicensed to REGENXBIO and sublicensed to us. Our product candidate DTX301 utilizes an AAV8 capsid and a codon-optimized version of the OTC gene. The in-licensed patents relevant to the AAV8 capsid expire between 2022 and 2024 in the U.S., and 2022 elsewhere. Our in-license also includes a pending application in the U.S. and corresponding foreign patent applications directed to the codon-optimized version of the OTC gene used in DTX301. Any patents issuing from these applications relating to the codon-optimized OTC gene would be projected to expire in 2035. We intend to pursue marketing and orphan drug exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries. DTX301 for the treatment of OTC deficiency has received orphan drug designation in the U.S. and Europe.
Trademarks 
 We have registered trademarks covering the Ultragenyx word mark in the U.S. and multiple other jurisdictions. In addition, we have a registered trademark in the U.S. covering a stylized design of our Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical logo. We also have pending trademark applications in the U.S. and multiple other jurisdictions relating to our Mepsevii brand name for vestronidase alfa.  
Other 
 We rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our ownership of know-how and trade secrets through an active program of legal mechanisms including assignments, confidentiality agreements, material transfer agreements, research collaborations, and licenses.
Manufacturing 
 We currently contract with third parties for the manufacturing and testing of our product and product candidates for use in preclinical, clinical, and commercial applications and intend to do so in the future. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the cGMP production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates. We do, however, have process and analytical development capabilities focused on the gene therapy technologies. The use of contracted manufacturing and reliance on collaboration partners is relatively cost-efficient and has minimized the need for our direct investment in manufacturing facilities and additional staff early in development. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee our contract manufacturers. All of our third-party manufacturers will be subject to periodic audits to confirm compliance with applicable regulations and must pass inspection before we can manufacture our drugs for commercial sales.
 To date, our third-party manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements. To meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, third parties with whom we currently work might need to increase their scale of production or we will need to secure alternate suppliers. We believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our clinical and commercial requirements, although we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, would not result in significant delay or material additional costs.

Product
 The Mepsevii drug substance and drug product are manufactured by Rentschler Biopharma SE, or Rentschler, under non-exclusive commercial supply and services agreements effective December 2017 and January 2018, respectively. The drug substance agreement has an initial term of five years, which will be automatically extended for another five years following the initial term, and will continue in full force and effect for its term unless earlier terminated. Following the initial term, we and Rentschler can withdraw from the agreement without cause upon prior notice for specified periods. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement if the other party breaches a material provision of the agreement and such breach remains uncured for a specified period following receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach. The drug product agreement expires on December 31, 2025 and will continue in full force and effect for its term unless earlier terminated. Either party may terminate the agreements with immediate effect if the other party violates or breaches certain obligations set forth in the agreement, undergoes a material change in control, or infringes its intellectual property rights. We can also terminate the agreements if Rentschler loses the right to operate under the agreement. Either party can also terminate the agreements if Rentschler is unable to deliver its agreed upon services for a certain period in the case of a force majeure event. The cell line to produce Mepsevii is specific for this product and is in our control and stored in multiple secure locations. All other raw materials are commercially available. Under the drug product agreement, the last product will be produced no later than June 30, 2019, unless this date is extended in accordance with the agreement. We intend to transfer the drug product manufacturing to a new site as the Rentschler drug product manufacturing in Laupheim, Germany is being discontinued.
Product Candidates
 Burosumab 
 The drug substance and drug product for burosumab are made by KHK in Japan under the collaboration and license agreement with KHK. The cell line to produce burosumab is specific for this product and is in KHK’s control. All other raw materials are commercially available. 
 UX007 
 The pharmaceutical-grade drug substance for UX007 is manufactured by IOI Oleo GmbH, or IOI Oleo, in Germany under an exclusive worldwide supply agreement, subject to certain limitations, executed in 2012 with an initial term of three years. The agreement automatically renews for two-year periods at the end of each then current term unless either party notifies the other party of its intention not to renew in writing at least three calendar months before the expiration of the then current term. Additionally, if a party materially breaches an obligation under the agreement and does not cure such breach within 60 days of receiving notice of the breach from the non-breaching party, the non-breaching party may terminate the agreement immediately upon written notice to the breaching party. Multiple parties have manufactured the UX007 drug product for us, which is not considered a very specialized task. 
 DTX301
 The drug substance and drug product for DTX301, our AAV product candidate, are manufactured on a non-exclusive basis by a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, pursuant to cGMP requirements. Since the beginning of 2015, this CMO has successfully completed two cGMP drug substance batches and two drug product batches of DTX301.
 DTX 301 is currently manufactured using HEK293 adherent mammalian cells. Adherent and suspension HEK293 cells are straightforward to grow and transfect readily, and as a result, are widely used in the biotechnology industry to produce therapeutic proteins and viral vectors for gene therapy on a small scale. Vectors produced using HEK293 cells have been, or are being, used safely in multiple clinical trials, including trials conducted in the United States and European Union by other biopharmaceutical companies and academic government institutions. A key advantage of the HEK293 cell manufacturing system is flexibility and the relative speed with which AAV vectors can be manufactured for early Phase 1/2 clinical trials, allowing the establishment of early indications of therapeutic benefit in patients. As we advance and scale up our processes for Phase 3 clinical and commercial scale manufacturing, we intend to transition from the HEK293 cell manufacturing scale used for our DTX301 Phase 1/2 programs to a cell-based suspension bioreactor format.
 Commercialization and Product Support 
 We have built our own commercial organizations in North America, Europe and Latin America to effectively support the commercialization of our product and product candidates and we expect to expand these efforts. We may elect to utilize strategic partners, distributors, or contract organizations to assist in the commercialization of our products. The commercial infrastructure for rare disease products typically consists of a targeted, specialty field organization that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians supported by field management, UltraCare liaisons (our commercial field force), internal support, and distribution support. One challenge, unique to commercializing therapies for rare diseases, is the difficulty in identifying eligible patients due to the very small and sometimes heterogeneous disease populations. Our management team will focus on maximizing patient identification for both clinical development and commercialization purposes in rare diseases. 
 20


Additional capabilities important to the rare disease marketplace include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies, and government accounts. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to regulatory approval of the products that they are intended to support. 
 We continue to build a medical affairs organization and multiple capabilities across North America, Europe and Latin America to meet the scientific needs of the healthcare providers and patients in the rare disease community, focusing on providing accurate and balanced disease state and product information across our portfolio for appropriate management of patients with rare disorders.
 Medical affairs is comprised of the following capabilities in support of our mission: medical information, patient advocacy, patient diagnosis, medical scientific liaisons, research and educational grants. Medical affairs will engage as early as Phase I and will continue work throughout the lifecycle of each product and product candidate as dictated by the specific scientific needs in each therapeutic area.
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States (including federal, state, and local authorities) and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing, and export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. We must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in the United States and foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Accordingly, our operations are and will be subject to a variety of regulations and other requirements, which vary from country to country. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Global Regulation of Clinical Studies 
 Clinical studies involve the administration of an investigational medicinal product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with protocols, GCP, the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and applicable regulatory requirements. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments are typically submitted to the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities as part of an IND or clinical trial application, or CTA. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical study site’s institutional review board, or IRB, or Ethics Committee, or EC, before the studies may be initiated, and the IRB or EC must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. 
 The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three or four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. 
  
• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic actions of the investigational new drug in humans, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational new drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. In some cases, additional studies and patient follow-up are conducted to gain experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. Regulatory authorities may condition approval of a marketing application for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A pivotal study is a clinical study that adequately meets regulatory authority requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are Phase 3 studies, but regulatory authorities may accept results from Phase 2 studies if the study design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust. 
 U.S. Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. 
 21


The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed or sold in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies performed in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin and must be updated annually;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication under an active IND and approved by an independent IRB representing each clinical site;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical studies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the proposed drug substance and drug product are produced to assess compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA inspection of one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA.
--+------------------------------------------

 Submission of an NDA or BLA to the FDA 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational new drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is subject to a significant application user fee, unless waived.  
 Once an NDA or BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA or BLA 
 The FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may impose additional requirements, such as post-marketing studies and/or a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical study(ies), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical studies, preclinical studies or manufacturing.
Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs 
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of NDAs and BLAs. For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and data demonstrate its potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The key benefits of fast track designation are the eligibility for priority review, rolling review (submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted), and accelerated approval, if relevant criteria are met. The FDA may grant the NDA or BLA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. 
 The FDA may approve an NDA or BLA under the accelerated approval program if the drug treats a serious condition, provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies, and demonstrates an effect on either (1) a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or (2) on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the drug’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. 
 22


In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, established the new Breakthrough Therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If a drug is designated as breakthrough therapy, FDA will provide more intensive guidance on the drug development program and expedite its review.
 Orphan Designation and Exclusivity 
 The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. 
 Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. In addition, the first NDA or BLA applicant to receive orphan drug designation for a particular drug is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years in the United States, except in limited circumstances. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. 
 Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 
 NDAs and BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of an investigational new drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations in order to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers if certain criteria are met. Discussions about pediatric development plans can be discussed with the FDA at any time, but usually occur any time between the end-of-Phase II meeting and submission of the NDA or BLA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the requirements for pediatric data do not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States that may be granted if certain FDA requirements are met, such as FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits, and the applicant agrees to perform and report on FDA-requested studies within a certain time frame. Pediatric exclusivity adds a period of six months of exclusivity to the end of all existing marketing exclusivity and patents held by the sponsor for that active moiety. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot accept or approve another application relying on the NDA or BLA sponsor’s data. 
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or Affordable Care Act, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product.  
 A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) eighteen months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) eighteen months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics’ patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period. 
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs and New Chemical Entity Exclusivity
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are bioequivalent (i.e. identical) to previously approved branded drugs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the FDA. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. 
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is bioequivalent to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, quality and performance characteristics, the strength of the drug, and intended use.

The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if an NDA or supplement includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. 
 When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, it must certify, among other things, that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, which is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 Patent Term Restoration 
 Some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. Thus, for each approved product, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our related owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond the original expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA. 
European Union Regulation 
 In the EU, to obtain regulatory approval of an investigational medicinal product, we must submit an MAA. The content of the MAA is similar to that of an NDA or BLA filed in the United States, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. 
Authorization Procedures
 Medicines can be authorized by using the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures. The centralized authorization procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the EMA that is valid across the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 28 member states of the EU plus Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering; contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; and officially designated orphan medicines. Medicines that fall outside the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure have three routes to authorization: (i) they can be authorized under the centralized procedure if they concern a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if their authorization would be in the interest of public health; (ii) they can be authorized under a decentralized procedure where an applicant applies for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country; or (iii) they can be authorized in a EU member state in accordance with that state’s national procedures and then be authorized in other EU countries by a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization (mutual recognition procedure). 
 A Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, and/or a request for waiver or deferral, is required for submission prior to submitting a marketing authorization application. A PIP describes, among other things, proposed pediatric studies and their timing relative to clinical studies in adults and an MAA must comply with the PIP to be validated.

MAA Review and Approval Timeframe and Accelerated Assessment 
 Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application that has been validated is 210 days, excluding time taken by an applicant to respond to questions. A favorable opinion on the application by the CHMP will typically result in the granting of the marketing authorization within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. Generally, the entire review process takes approximately one year. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding time taken by an applicant to respond to questions. 
Exceptional Circumstances/Conditional Approval 
 Orphan drugs or drugs with unmet medical needs may be eligible for EU approval under exceptional circumstances or with conditional approval. Approval under exceptional circumstances is applicable to orphan products and is used when an applicant is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use because the indication for which the product is intended is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, when the present state of scientific knowledge does not allow comprehensive information to be provided, or when it is medically unethical to collect such information. Conditional marketing authorization is applicable to orphan medicinal products, medicinal products for seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases, or medicinal products to be used in emergency situations in response to recognized public threats. Conditional marketing authorization can be granted on the basis of less complete data than is normally required in order to meet unmet medical needs and in the interest of public health, provided the risk-benefit balance is positive, it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide the comprehensive clinical data, and unmet medical needs will be fulfilled. Conditional marketing authorization is subject to certain specific obligations to be reviewed annually. 
 PRIME Program
 PRIME is a program launched by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. The program focuses on medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients without treatment options. These medicines are considered priority medicines by EMA. To be accepted for PRIME, a medicine has to show its potential to benefit patients with unmet medical needs based on early clinical data. Through PRIME, the EMA offers early and proactive support to medicine developers to optimize development plans and the generation of robust data on a medicine’s benefits and risks and enables accelerated assessment of medicines applications.
 Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU Community and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
New Chemical Entity Exclusivity 
 In the EU, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.

Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to regulatory approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the regulatory authorities, including, among other things, requirements relating to formal commitments for post approval clinical trials and studies, manufacturing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior regulatory authority review and approval. 
 Drug manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities and country or state agencies for compliance with GMP and other requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior regulatory approval before being implemented. Regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from GMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with GMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may be subject to various laws targeting, among other things, fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters and imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), replacing the EU Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC), effective May 25, 2018, which seeks to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe to ensure data subjects’ fundamental right to privacy in the EU in the digital age by imposing requirements and limitations relating to the processing, storage, purpose of collection, accuracy, security and transmission of personal data and the notification of regulation authorities about data breaches, accompanied by a strong sanctioning mechanism;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, signed into law in December 2016, which introduced a wide range of reforms, such as broadening the types of data required to support drug approval, extending protections for generic competition, accelerating approval of breakthrough therapies, expanding the orphan drug product program, requiring disclosures about compassionate care programs, and clarifying how manufacturers communicate about their products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, that requires drug manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Regulation 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or FCPA, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Similar laws exist in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, that restrict improper payments to public and private parties. Many countries have laws prohibiting these types of payments within the respective country. In addition to these anti-corruption laws, we are subject to import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and regulatory limitations on our ability to operate in certain foreign markets.
 In addition, federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted, are considering adopting, or may adopt laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable information or other information treated as confidential obtained from consumers and individuals.
 We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state or local regulations. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by, our operations.
