 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Overview
 We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the dermatology market. Our focus is to develop products that treat dermatologic conditions that are not being adequately addressed or those where current therapies and approaches are suboptimal. Our strategy is to bring new products to market by improving delivery mechanisms and/or identifying alternative applications for U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved or well characterized active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs. Our goal is to reduce the time, cost and risks typically associated with new product development by utilizing APIs with demonstrated safety profiles and, when applicable, taking advantage of the regulatory approval pathway under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act. Section 505(b)(2) permits an applicant for a new product, such as a new or improved formulation or a new use of an approved product, to rely in part, on literature and/or on the FDA’s findings of safety and/or effectiveness for a similar previously-approved product. Our approach is to identify the limitations of current treatment options and work to develop novel products using our proprietary HyantX topical drug delivery system.  Product Candidates
 We have developed our product portfolio using our HyantX topical drug delivery system. The following chart presents a summary of our product candidates:

 HyantX Topical Drug Delivery System
 Our HyantX topical delivery system, an anhydrous hydrophilic gel formulation, allows for the stabilization and solubilization of APIs, which is designed to improve bioavailability and therefore lower the required dose of the drug. The system is designed for rapid absorption of API into the skin rather than remaining on the surface, a common problem with oil‑based ointments and suspensions. The delivery system is particularly suitable for APIs, or a combination of APIs, that undergo degradation by hydrolysis or oxidation. Our lead product candidates are minocycline formulations delivered topically using the HyantX system in non-oily and non-occlusive gel vehicle. 
 BPX01 (minocycline) gel, 2% — Acne
 BPX01 is a topical antibiotic gel for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of acne, which combines the most widely used oral antibiotic drug (minocycline) for the treatment of inflammatory acne with a proprietary anhydrous hydrophilic topical delivery system, the HyantX delivery system, specifically designed to localize the delivery of the drug while minimizing systemic exposure and the resultant side effects. Our proprietary HyantX topical delivery system

allows for a lower dosage of drug by improving the bioavailability with targeted delivery of fully solubilized minocycline. In addition to its bacteriostatic properties, the API, minocycline, also has anti‑inflammatory properties, which may help to reduce the inflammation and redness commonly associated with acne.
 We completed a Phase 2b randomized, double‑blind, three‑arm, vehicle‑controlled, dose‑finding study to assess the efficacy and safety of BPX01 for the treatment of acne. The multi‑center study evaluated two concentrations of BPX01 (1% and 2% minocycline) and vehicle in 226 subjects, aged 9 to 40, with moderate‑to‑severe inflammatory, non‑nodular acne. The study showed the 2% concentration was statistically superior in reducing the number of inflammatory lesions in patients with moderate‑to‑severe acne, compared to vehicle (58.5% reduction vs. 43.8%, respectively, at week 12, p=0.03).

 This Phase 2b study also measured, as a secondary endpoint, improvement on a five‑point investigator’s global assessment, or IGA, scale. The observed difference between BPX01 2% versus vehicle in achieving a two-grade improvement and an IGA score of 0 or 1 at week 12 using the Last-Observation-Carried-Forward method for study participants with missing data was 25.0% (18/72) vs. 17.6% (13/74) producing a chi-square p-value of 0.27 (without Bonferroni correction for pairwise comparison). As a Phase 2b clinical trial, the trial was not powered to measure statistical significance for the secondary endpoint, however, a clear numerical trend was observed in the BPX01 2% arm compared to vehicle. IGA was included as a secondary endpoint in our Phase 2b study as this information is necessary to calculate sample size estimates to adequately power the Phase 3 studies for success. Since FDA guidance for the approval of topical prescription acne products recommends IGA as a co‑primary endpoint along with a reduction in absolute lesion counts for Phase 3 trials to support a New Drug Application, or NDA, the planned Phase 3 studies will be powered to demonstrate statistical significance of IGA improvement with at least a two‑grade improvement and a score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) for drug compared to vehicle as well as being powered to show a reduction in inflammatory lesion counts.
 The safety results of the study showed that no subjects experienced serious treatment‑related adverse side effects. As cutaneous tolerability of a topical therapy is a significant driver in patient compliance, we are encouraged that 97% of cutaneous tolerability signs or symptoms were “none” or “mild” at week 12. 

 Blood draws in this study showed that plasma minocycline levels following topical use were undetectable in all but a single subject, whose level – 42 ng/mL – was less than one‑tenth of that measured after a single standard adult dosage of oral minocycline.

 BPX04 (minocycline) gel, 1% — Rosacea
 BPX04 is a topical antibiotic gel with fully solubilized minocycline, also leveraging our HyantX delivery system, for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea. We have completed a 30 subject, single center, open‑label feasibility study of BPX04 to assess the safety and cutaneous tolerability of BPX04 at 0% (vehicle), 1% and 2% minocycline for the treatment of moderate-to-severe papulopustular rosacea. In this study, no serious adverse events were observed and the treatment-related adverse events were related to dermal irritation in the 2% minocycline treatment arm. As cutaneous tolerability of a topical therapy is a significant driver in patient compliance, we are encouraged that 90% of cutaneous tolerability signs or symptoms were “none” or “mild” at Week 12. 

 The directional efficacy data collected for the 1% dose also showed promise. Given these results, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 2b study in subjects at least 18 years old with 15 to 70 inflammatory lesions with no more than 2 nodules and an IGA score of 3 or 4 (moderate or severe) at baseline. The trial has enrolled 207 subjects. The primary endpoint for this Phase 2b study is an absolute mean change in the number of inflammatory lesions. We anticipate announcing topline efficacy and safety results in July 2019.
 Other Products
 On November 27, 2018, we entered into an agreement to divest the rights to our molecular iodine technology, or BPX03, and our dietary supplement product, VI2OLET. Each of our prior collaboration, license, colocation and supply agreements related to VI2OLET were terminated or assigned to the purchaser.
 We have also elected to discontinue development of BPX02, our injectable product utilizing biologic materials, to focus on our HyantX delivery system and our other product candidates.
 Target Markets
 We believe that the industry dynamics in medical dermatology represent significant opportunities for innovative new delivery technologies and products to emerge as solutions for unmet needs in multi‑billion dollar therapeutic categories. In particular, we believe that the dermatology market is a large specialty market with significant global patient demand, and that our focus on this market, coupled with our HyantX topical delivery system, should enable us to develop and commercialize attractive products within this category. The Acne Market
 Acne is a common inflammatory skin condition considered a chronic disease with accompanying negative aesthetic and social impact on patients. Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) are normal inhabitants on human skin and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory acne.
 In the United States alone, acne affects between 40 million and 50 million people each year according to the American Academy of Dermatology. According to SSR Health, a provider of health care focused investment research, branded acne prescription medication accounted for $4.2 billion in sales in the rolling twelve month period ending September 2017 ($2.0 billion topical and $2.2 billion oral). The leading manufacturers are Galderma S.A., Almirall S.A., Bausch Health Companies Inc., Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., and Mayne Pharma Group Limited.

 The Rosacea Market
 Rosacea is a chronic dermatologic condition characterized by redness, stinging and inflammatory lesions primarily on the face. It has four subtypes including erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, papulopustular rosacea, phymatous rosacea, and ocular rosacea. Symptoms include dilated blood vessels, redness, swelling, and acne‑like papules and pustules on the face. The biology of rosacea remains unclear, however, it is thought to be an inflammatory disorder that involves immune responses and microorganisms.
 Rosacea is estimated to affect more than 16 million people in the United States alone, according to the National Rosacea Society. The rosacea market is estimated to be greater than $1.0 billion in the United States according to Symphony Health Services. Branded prescription product revenue was $590.0 million in 2017 according to SSR Health, with more than 90% of this revenue being generated by three brands. The leading manufacturers are Galderma S.A. and LEO Pharma A/S.

  Technology and Intellectual Property
 Overview
 Our success, in large part, depends upon our ability to obtain and protect our proprietary products and platform technologies. Our goal is to develop an intellectual property portfolio that enables us to capitalize on the research and development that we have performed to date and will perform in the future, particularly for each of the products in our development pipeline and each of the products we market. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other countries to obtain and protect our intellectual property. 
 We also rely on a combination of non‑disclosure, confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our technologies and intellectual property. We require our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment or consulting relationships with us. We also require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived in connection with the relationship.
 Patents
 Patent protection is an important aspect of our product development process and we are actively developing intellectual property in‑house. We have a total of seven U.S. provisional and utility patent applications pending related to our topical compositions for dermatological conditions. We have five issued U.S. patents. Four of these patents relate to a microparticle drug delivery technology. One of these relates to BPX01, BPX04 and the HyantX topical delivery system. We also have one issued international patent and 23 pending international patent applications. Of the 23 pending international applications, 20 relate to BPX01, BPX04 and the HyantX topical delivery system and two relate to a microparticle drug delivery technology. These international patent applications resulted from development of our unique formulations, for example with minocycline, and were filed according to local national laws or the Patent Cooperation Treaty. Generally, a patent application filed according to the Patent Cooperation Treaty enables us to apply for patent protection for the invention(s) described in the application in individual countries within a specified period after filing the application. Generally, patents issued in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest non-provisional

filing date, if the application from which the patent issues was filed on or after June 8, 1995 (otherwise the term is the longer of 17 years from the issue date and 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date). The duration of patent terms for non-U.S. patents is typically 20 years from the earliest corresponding national or international filing date.
 Trademarks
 We have applied for trademark protection for several trademarks in the United States. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, has registered several of our trademarks: “BIOPHARMX,” “HYANTX” and “SMARTER DRUG DELIVERY”.
 We have also applied for trademark protection in three markets outside the United States. In the European Union and China, we have a registered trademark for “BIOPHARMX”.  
 Research and Development
 A core competency is providing the link between concept and commercialization through focused, practical product development based on innovative research. We employ highly‑qualified scientists and utilize consultants specializing in our various product development areas. Research and development expenses for both the years ended January 31, 2019 and 2018 were approximately $9.1 million.
 As a San Jose‑based company, we are located in a region with many strong biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, which have drawn a high caliber of scientists and scientific support staff to the region. While there is intense competition for this type of personnel, we believe our location enables us to expand our product development and consultant resources as our business grows. Our location also provides us with convenient access to local formulation resources and preclinical testing facilities.
 Manufacturing, Supply and Production
 We utilize contract manufacturers to produce our products for clinical development and commercial distribution. We have no plans to establish in‑house manufacturing capabilities for large‑scale production at this time.
 We have a master service agreement in place with DPT Laboratories, Ltd., or DPT, to carry out the manufacturing of clinical supplies. DPT provides drug development services including formulation development, clinical and commercial manufacturing satisfying the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, analytical methods development and stability testing. Additionally, we have a master service agreement with Dow Development Laboratories, LLC, to conduct formulation and analytical development and stability studies, among other services.  We are evaluating a second vendor to carry out the manufacturing and testing of our clinical and commercial supplies.
 Marketing, Sales & Distribution
 Our team has experience in the commercialization of prescription products across several different therapeutic areas.
 While BPX01 and BPX04 continue through clinical development, we have commenced our go‑to‑market strategic planning for these products including, but not limited to, organizing a medical advisory board of dermatologists in the United States, educating physicians through publishing our preclinical and clinical results at several industry conferences and developing our market access and pricing strategy. In anticipation of commercial launch, we will evaluate our needs and take steps toward building our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure. Our commercialization plans will largely depend on whether we enter into a strategic partnership for one or both of the product candidates and the nature of such partnership. Although we continue to evaluate commercializing directly in the United States, we may choose to pursue strategic partnerships to launch the product outside of the United States, pending the appropriate regulatory approvals in each country, in order to take advantage of well‑established sales, marketing and distribution networks established by leading pharmaceutical companies in such countries. Customers
 Potential customers for our product candidates include pharmaceutical companies, physician’s practices, dermatologists and general practitioners.

 Competition
 Acne
 While the acne market has a number of competitive products, BPX01 is being developed to combine the most successful oral antibiotic drug (minocycline) for the treatment of moderate‑severe acne with a targeted topical antibiotic technology specifically designed to localize the delivery of the drug while minimizing systemic side effects. At the present time, there is no FDA‑approved topical solution for this drug.
 A number of approved prescription acne products currently exist in oral form such as isotretinoins, antibiotics, antimicrobials and oral contraceptives. These treatments are marketed by a number of large pharmaceutical and specialty pharmaceutical companies including, but not limited to:Almirall S.A., Bausch Health Companies Inc., Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., and Mayne Pharma Group Limited. Additionally, there are several prescription acne products that exist in topical form such as antibiotics, antimicrobials, azelaic acids, retinoids, or some combination of the two. These topical solutions are marketed by companies such as Galderma S.A., Almirall S.A., Bausch Health Companies Inc., and Mayne Pharma Group Limited. In addition to prescription acne therapies discussed above, there are numerous over-the-counter, or OTC, products in the form of benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid topical solutions available from various cosmetic and cosmeceutical companies such as Aveeno, Clean & Clear, Clearasil, Neutrogena and Proactiv.
 Energy‑based devices have also been widely used by dermatologists, such as intense pulsed light, or IPL, and a device called elos, by Syneron Medical Ltd. and Candela Corporation, that uses a combination of IPL and radiofrequency technologies. Combination drug‑device treatments, such as fractional lasers and photodynamic therapy, or PDT, with blue light, such as BLU-U by Dusa Pharmaceuticals, have been used to treat acne.
 While there is no FDA‑approved topical minocycline solution for acne (or otherwise), we are aware of one competitive product that has completed its Phase 3 clinical trials and submitted an NDA for the treatment of acne.
 Rosacea
 Unlike the acne market, the rosacea market has a relatively limited number of available therapies. The challenge with current topical treatments is that skin with rosacea is easily aggravated by too much drug or an irritating vehicle.  BPX04 is designed to deliver the active, minocycline, into the skin without further irritating the skin. While the cause of rosacea is unclear, there are various oral and topical medications to treat the condition, such as antibiotics, anti-parasitics, azelaic acid and alpha-A agonists. Current treatments are marketed by companies such as Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc., LEO Pharma A/S, and Galderma S.A. In addition to prescription rosacea therapies, devices such as IPL and the pulsed dye laser can be helpful in treating other rosacea symptoms, such as telangiectasia and vascular erythema. 
 While there is no FDA-approved topical minocycline solution for rosacea (or otherwise), we are aware of two competitive products which have completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials.
 Government Regulation
 In the United States, foods, drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, tobacco products and radiation‑emitting products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the manufacture, distribution and sale of these products. These laws and regulations prescribe criminal and civil penalties that can be assessed, and violation of these laws and regulations can result in enforcement action by the FDA and other regulatory agencies.
 FDA Regulation of Drugs
 New Drug Approval Process
 Pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may 

 
  8

 
subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre‑market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 A 30‑day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30‑day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the IND to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit‑risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases the FDA requires two adequate and well‑controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in  instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access.

After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently approximately $2,588,000 for fiscal year 2019.  Under an approved NDA, the applicant is subject to an annual program fee, currently approximately $310,000 per prescription product for fiscal year 2019. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, this annual program fee replaces the annual product and establishment fees. These fees typically increase annually.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be filed based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If the NDA submission is filed, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late‑submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee – typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts – for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMPs is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post‑approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 Pediatric Information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs, or supplements to NDAs, must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted, except a product with a new 

 
  10

 
active ingredient that is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target determined by FDA to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer that is subject to an NDA submitted on or after August 18, 2020.
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six‑month extension of any exclusivity – patent or non‑patent – for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA‑regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. The Hatch‑Waxman Amendments
 Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims covering the applicant’s product or method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method‑of‑use rather than certify to a listed method‑of‑use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been received by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non‑patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
 Exclusivity
 Exclusivity provisions under the FDC Act also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDC Act provides a five‑year period of non‑patent exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain 

 
  11

 
approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, or NCE. A drug is entitled to NCE exclusivity if it contains a drug substance no active moiety of which has been previously approved by the FDA. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or file a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification. The FDC Act also provides three years of market exclusivity for an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three‑year exclusivity covers only the conditions for use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs for the original conditions of use, such as the originally approved indication. Five‑year and three‑year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all the non‑clinical studies and adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Patent Term Extension
 After NDA approval, the owner of relevant drug patent may apply for up to a five year patent term extension. Only one patent may be extended for each regulatory review period, which is composed of two parts: a testing phase, and an approval phase. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase – the time between the day the IND becomes effective and NDA submission – and all of the review phase – the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years and only one patent may be extended.
 For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post‑approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
 Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
 Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2), NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use, such as the FDA’s findings of safety and/or effectiveness for a similar previously approved product, or published literature, in support of its application.
 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Thus approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non‑patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.

 Post‑Approval Requirements
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post‑approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post‑approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct‑to‑consumer advertising, off‑label promotion, industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post‑marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality‑control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality‑control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. In addition, prescription drug manufacturers in the United States must comply with applicable provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and provide and receive product tracing information, maintain appropriate licenses, ensure they only work with other properly licensed entities, and have procedures in place to identify and properly handle suspect and illegitimate products.
 Regulation Outside the United States
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the Company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Regulation and Marketing Authorization in the European Union
 The process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union, or E.U., follows essentially the same lines as in the United States and, likewise, generally involves satisfactorily completing each of the following:
· | preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the applicable E.U. Good Laboratory Practice regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the relevant national authorities of a clinical trial application, or CTA, which must be approved before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, which includes the data supporting safety and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product in clinical development and proposed labelling;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an inspection by the relevant national authorities of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product is produced to assess compliance with strictly enforced current cGMP;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | potential audits of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the MAA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  13

 


· | review and approval by the relevant competent authority of the MAA before any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Preclinical Studies
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animal studies, in order to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with the relevant E.U. regulations and requirements. The results of the preclinical tests, together with relevant manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of the CTA. Clinical Trial Approval
 Requirements for the conduct of clinical trials in the European Union including GCP are implemented in the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the GCP Directive 2005/28/EC. Pursuant to Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC, as amended, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the competent national authority of an E.U. member state in which a study is planned to be conducted, or in multiple member states if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of member states. To this end, a CTA is submitted, which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier, or IMPD, and further supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and other applicable guidance documents. Furthermore, a clinical trial may only be started after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the clinical trial application in that country.
 In April 2014, the E.U. legislators passed the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, which will replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. To ensure that the rules for clinical trials are identical throughout the E.U., the new E.U. clinical trials legislation was passed as a regulation that is directly applicable in all E.U. member states. All clinical trials performed in the European Union are required to be conducted in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC until the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 becomes applicable.  According to the current plans of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, the new Clinical Trials Regulation will become applicable in 2019. The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC will, however, still apply three years from the date of entry into application of the Clinical Trials Regulation to (i) clinical trials applications submitted before the entry into application and (ii) clinical trials applications submitted within one year after the entry into application if the sponsor opts for old system.
 The new Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trial in the E.U. The main characteristics of the regulation include:

· | a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the E.U. portal;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures that will spare sponsors from submitting broadly identical information separately to various bodies and different member states;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed jointly by all member states concerned. Part II is assessed separately by each member state concerned;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial application; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the involvement of the ethics committees in the assessment procedure in accordance with the national law of the member state concerned but within the overall timelines defined by the Regulation (EU) No 536/2014.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Marketing Authorization
 Authorization to market a product in the member states of the European Union proceeds under one of four procedures: a centralized authorization procedure, a mutual recognition procedure, a decentralized procedure or a national procedure. Centralized Authorization Procedure
 The centralized procedure enables applicants to obtain a marketing authorization that is valid in all E.U. member states based on a single application. Certain medicinal products, including products developed by means of biotechnological processes, must undergo the centralized authorization procedure for marketing authorization, which, if granted by the European Commission, is automatically valid in all 28 E.U. member states. The EMA and the European Commission administer this centralized authorization procedure pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.
 Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, this procedure is mandatory for:

· | medicinal products developed by means of one of the following biotechnological processes:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | recombinant DNA technology;
--+----------------------------


· | controlled expression of genes coding for biologically active proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes including transformed mammalian cells; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | hybridoma and monoclonal antibody methods;
--+-------------------------------------------


· | advanced therapy medicinal products as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No. 1394/2007 on advanced therapy medicinal products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | medicinal products for human use containing a new active substance that, on the date of effectiveness of this regulation, was not authorized in the E.U., and for which the therapeutic indication is the treatment of any of the following diseases:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | acquired immune deficiency syndrome;
--+-------------------------------------


· | cancer;
--+--------


· | neurodegenerative disorder;
--+----------------------------


· | diabetes;
--+----------


· | auto‑immune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | viral diseases;
--+----------------


· | medicinal products that are designated as orphan medicinal products pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 141/2000.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The centralized authorization procedure is optional for other medicinal products if they contain a new active substance or if the applicant shows that the medicinal product concerned constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or that the granting of authorization is in the interest of patients in the European Union.
 Administrative Procedure
 Under the centralized authorization procedure, the EMA’s Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, serves as the scientific committee that renders opinions about the safety, efficacy and quality of medicinal products for human use on behalf of the EMA. The CHMP is composed of experts nominated by each member state’s 

 
  15

 
national authority for medicinal products, with expert appointed to act as Rapporteur for the co‑ordination of the evaluation with the possible assistance of a further member of the Committee acting as a Co‑Rapporteur. After approval, the Rapporteur(s) continue to monitor the product throughout its life cycle. The CHMP has 210 days to adopt an opinion as to whether a marketing authorization should be granted. The process usually takes longer in case additional information is requested, which triggers clock‑stops in the procedural timelines. The process is complex and involves extensive consultation with the regulatory authorities of member states and a number of experts. When an application is submitted for a marketing authorization in respect of a drug that is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation, the applicant may pursuant to Article 14(9) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 request an accelerated assessment procedure. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time‑limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time‑limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. Once the procedure is completed, a European Public Assessment Report, or EPAR, is produced. If the opinion is negative, information is given as to the grounds on which this conclusion was reached. After the adoption of the CHMP opinion, a decision on the MAA must be adopted by the European Commission, after consulting the E.U. member states, which in total can take more than 60 days.
 Conditional Approval
 In specific circumstances, E.U. legislation (Article 14(7) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 on Conditional Marketing Authorizations for Medicinal Products for Human Use) enables applicants to obtain a conditional marketing authorization prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products) if (1) the risk‑benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) the product fulfills unmet medical needs and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk‑benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization. Marketing Authorization under Exceptional Circumstances
 Under Article 14(8) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, products for which the applicant can demonstrate that comprehensive data (in line with the requirements laid down in Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended) cannot be provided (due to specific reasons foreseen in the legislation) might be eligible for marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances. This type of authorization is reviewed annually to reassess the risk‑benefit balance. The fulfillment of any specific procedures/obligations imposed as part of the marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is aimed at the provision of information on the safe and effective use of the product and will normally not lead to the completion of a full dossier/approval. Market Authorizations Granted by Authorities of E.U. Member States
 In general, if the centralized procedure is not followed, there are three alternative procedures as prescribed in Directive 2001/83/EC:

· | the decentralized procedure allows applicants to file identical applications to several E.U. member states and receive simultaneous national approvals based on the recognition by E.U. member states of an assessment by a reference member state;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the national procedure is only available for products intended to be authorized in a single E.U. member state; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a mutual recognition procedure similar to the decentralized procedure is available when a marketing authorization has already been obtained in at least one E.U. member state.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  16

 

 A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union.
 Pediatric Studies
 Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA‑approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product‑specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are set forth in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, which is referred to as the Pediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Pediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine in children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine in children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population.
 Before a marketing authorization application can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP.
 Periods of Authorization and Renewals
 A marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re‑evaluation of the risk‑benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five‑year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the E.U. market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so‑called sunset clause).
 Regulatory Data Protection
 E.U. legislation also provides for a system of regulatory data and market exclusivity. According to Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities approved on the basis of complete independent data package benefit from eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the E.U. from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application. During the additional two‑year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten‑year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the innovator is able to gain the period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical test, preclinical tests and clinical trials. However, products designated as orphan medicinal products enjoy, upon receiving marketing authorization, a period of ten years of orphan market exclusivity. Depending upon the timing and duration of the E.U. marketing authorization process, products may be eligible for up to five years’ supplementary protection certificates, or SPCs, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 469/2009. Such SPCs extend the rights under the basic patent for the drug. Regulatory Requirements After a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained
 If we obtain authorization for a medicinal product in the E.U., we will be required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products:

 
  17

 

 Pharmacovigilance and other requirements
 We will, for example, have to comply with the E.U.’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post‑authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. Other requirements relate, for example, to the manufacturing of products and APIs in accordance with good manufacturing practice standards. E.U. regulators may conduct inspections to verify our compliance with applicable requirements, and we will have to continue to expend time, money and effort to remain compliant. Non‑compliance with E.U. requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties in the E.U. Similarly, failure to comply with the E.U.’s requirements regarding the protection of individual personal data can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions. Individual E.U. member states may also impose various sanctions and penalties in case we do not comply with locally applicable requirements.
 Manufacturing
 The manufacturing of authorized drugs, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must be conducted in strict compliance with the EMA’s Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, requirements and comparable requirements of other regulatory bodies in the E.U., which mandate the methods, facilities and controls used in manufacturing, processing and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity. The EMA enforces its current GMP requirements through mandatory registration of facilities and inspections of those facilities. The EMA may have a coordinating role for these inspections while the responsibility for carrying them out rests with the member states competent authority under whose responsibility the manufacturer falls. Failure to comply with these requirements could interrupt supply and result in delays, unanticipated costs and lost revenues, and could subject the applicant to potential legal or regulatory action, including but not limited to warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil and criminal penalties. Marketing and Promotion
 The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry‑sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union under Directive 2001/83/EC. The applicable regulations aim to ensure that information provided by holders of marketing authorizations regarding their products is truthful, balanced and accurately reflects the safety and efficacy claims authorized by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Patent Term Extension
 In order to compensate the patentee for delays in obtaining a marketing authorization for a patented product, a supplementary certificate, or SPC, may be granted extending the exclusivity period for that specific product by up to five years. Applications for SPCs must be made to the relevant patent office in each E.U. member state and the granted certificates are valid only in the member state of grant. An application has to be made by the patent owner within six months of the first marketing authorization being granted in the European Union (assuming the patent in question has not expired, lapsed or been revoked) or within six months of the grant of the patent (if the marketing authorization is granted first). In the context of SPCs, the term “product” means the active ingredient or combination of active ingredients for a medicinal product and the term “patent” means a patent protecting such a product or a new manufacturing process or application for it. The duration of an SPC is calculated as the difference between the patent’s filing date and the date of the first marketing authorization, minus five years, subject to a maximum term of five years.
 A six month pediatric extension of an SPC may be obtained where the patentee has carried out an agreed pediatric investigation plan, the authorized product information includes information on the results of the studies and the product is authorized in all member states of the European Union.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
    
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom, or U.K. voted in favor of leaving the E.U., which is commonly referred to as “Brexit.” Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the E. U. of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will take effect either 

 
  18

 
on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the U.K. provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the E.U. Treaty. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the U.K. covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from E.U. directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the U.K. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the U.K.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third‑party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third‑party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third‑party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.
 In the E.U., pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost‑effectiveness of our drug candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessment) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the E.U. provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. E.U. member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the Company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various E.U. member states, and parallel distribution (arbitrage between low‑priced and high‑priced member states), can further reduce prices. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
 Healthcare Law and Regulation
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third‑party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third‑party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:
· | the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  19

 

government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal transparency requirements under the Health Care Reform Law requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, with such information published on a searchable website on an annual basis; failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties; effective January 1, 2022, transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives must also be reported; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non‑governmental third‑party payors, including private insurers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  An increasing number of states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to file periodic reports of expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states; to make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities; to report information pertaining to and justifying price increases; or to register their sales representatives.  Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals; price gouging; or pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing. In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
 The manufacturing facilities of the third‑parties that develop our product candidates are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in a number of jurisdictions, governing, among other things: the use, storage, registration, handling, emission and disposal of chemicals, waste materials and sewage; chemicals, air, water and ground contamination; air emissions and the cleanup of contaminated sites, including any contamination that results from spills due to our failure to properly dispose of chemicals, waste materials and sewage.
