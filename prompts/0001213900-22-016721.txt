ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Business Overview



Microalliance Group Inc. is a US holding company incorporated in Nevada on February 25, 2004 and operating through the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Wei Lian Jin Meng Group Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands on June 30, 2020 (“WLJM Cayman”) and WLJM Cayman’s subsidiaries. The Company’s entire business, including operations, employees, sales and marketing and research and development, are all conducted through its subsidiaries located within the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). The Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada on February 7, 2022 to change its corporate name from Fountain Healthy Aging, Inc. to Microalliance Group Inc.



Currently, the Company’s business primarily consists of two types of products: coffee and liquor. The Company, through its PRC subsidiaries, develops, produces, markets and sells flagship “coffee tea” products, which are innovative specialty coffee products with Chinese black tea’s taste, as well as black coffee products and other coffee products. We sell our coffee products wholesale to retail partners and corporate customers, and we also sell directly to consumers in the PRC via our e-commerce channels. We commit to build the first brand of “coffee tea” culture in the PRC. As of the date of this report, we have entered into franchise agreements with a large number of franchisees relating to the distribution, marketing and sale of our coffee products, and we are offering five different coffee products.



Our liquor products are sold across China through sales agents, distributors and franchisees. Our licensed “Nainiang Liquor” retail stores have opened in a dozen cities in China, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Foshan, Zhaoqing, Huangshan, Jingzhou and Baoding, to primarily market and sell our proprietary brand liquor products to consumers. We supply the licensed retail stores with our liquor products and maintain quality and uniformity throughout the licensed stores by requiring uniform retail prices, providing continual trainings, periodic field visits by our marketing personnel and holding annual and special meetings of franchisees. Such retail stores launch marketing initiatives like tasting events to increase our brand awareness and promote sales. We currently sell six liquor products, including featured “coffee spirit” products and vintage “Baijiu” products. Our “coffee spirit” products are independently innovated by us and unique in China, representing spirits fermented from a mixture of sorghum and coffee beans. Our “Baijiu” (a type of Chinese liquor made from whole grain with alcohol content from 40-60%) products have excellent quality and we own a large stock of vintage Baijiu whose value grows as they age. The liquor market size is massive which generates more revenues than the coffee business.



COVID-19 Impacts



The COVID-19 pandemic has had negative impact on our business, operating results and cash flows. The spread of the novel coronavirus, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has caused different countries and cities to mandate curfews, including “shelter-in-place” and closures of most non-essential businesses as well as other measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. Our coffee factory in Dongguan as well as offices, contracted liquor producers and licensed “Nainiang Liquor” retail stores in Shenzhen have been temporarily closed due to COVID-19 resurgences and local containment measures. Consumer demand for liquor products has dropped during lockdown periods as a result of social distancing policies and reduced gatherings. The PRC was relatively successful in containing the pandemic throughout most of 2020 under the curfew and social distancing measures. However, the PRC has been experiencing a resurgent outbreak since beginning of 2022. In addition, our plan to expand internationally has largely stalled due to COVID-19. It remains difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the broader economy and our coffee and liquor business in particular.

Products



The Company, through its PRC subsidiaries, currently offers five coffee products and six liquor products.



Our coffee products include flagship “coffee tea” products, which are innovative specialty coffee products with Chinese black tea’s taste. We also offer premium black coffee and other coffee products.



Our “Nainiang” liquor line features “coffee spirit” and Baijiu products. Our unique “coffee spirit” products represent spirits fermented from a mixture of sorghum and coffee beans, with different alcohol content from 22% to 42%. Our Baijiu offerings consist of high quality, fragrant Baijiu (a type of Chinese liquor made from whole grain with alcohol content from 40-60% that has a long history and is the most popular type of spirits in China).



Suppliers



We have a limited number of suppliers for our raw materials and logistics service. In 2020 and 2021, we purchased our coffee beans mainly from one supplier. We also cooperate with three different delivery service providers from warehouses to our customers. 



Currently, we outsource the production of our branded liquor products to three third-party liquor producers and partner with three transportation vendors to deliver liquor products from warehouses to customers.



We maintain good relationships with our suppliers, and as of the date of this filing, we have not experienced any material disputes or supply shortages.



Competitive Strengths 



We believe that the following competitive strengths contribute to our success and differentiate us from our competitors: 




● | Innovative “coffee tea” products. Chinese consumers are already familiar with tea, a traditional Chinese drink. Our “coffee tea” products are aimed at attracting Chinese consumers who are also interested in coffee. Our black coffee products and other coffee products are also targeting coffee consumers in China.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Stable source of premium coffee beans. Our commitment to quality is uncompromising. We source premium Arabica coffee beans from coffee plantations covering 500,000 mu (approximately 82,368 acres or 129 square miles) in Yunnan Province that are located between 15 degrees north latitude and the Tropic of Cancer—an ideal area for coffee growth. Most of this production area is between 1,000 and 2,000 meters above sea level. The terrain is mainly mountainous and sloping land with large fluctuations, fertile soil, ample sunshine, abundant rainfall, and the day and night temperature difference is large. All of these unique natural conditions make our Arabian coffee beans fragrant, taste strong but not bitter and slightly fruity. We believe that such coffee beans are favored by mainstream Chinese coffee consumers. We maintain good relationships with our suppliers, and as of the date of this filing, we have not experienced any material disputes or supply shortages.

● | Proprietary, effectively managed production base. We have our own dedicated production base, a coffee factory that was established in October 2018, to process the coffee beans harvested at the plantation in Yunnan Province. Processing the coffee beans includes roasting, grinding, mixing and packaging the beans into our finished products. We employ a natural production process without any additives. With our own production facilities, we can maintain control of the quality of our products and adjust the formula of our products to meet the rapidly changing tastes of our customers. We have designed stringent quality control standards and enforced comprehensive quality control measures covering supplier selection, quality inspection and testing.

Pursuant to the China Company Law, where laws on foreign investment have other stipulations, such stipulations shall prevail. In December 2021, the SCNPC issued the draft amendment to the China Company Law for comment. The draft amended China Company Law has made roughly 70 substantive changes to the 13 chapters and 218 articles of the current Company Law (rev. 2018).

The Negative List set out in a unified manner the restrictive measures, such as the requirements on shareholding percentages and management, for the access of foreign investments, and the industries that are prohibited for foreign investment. The Negative List covers 12 industries, and any field not falling in the Negative List shall be administered under the principle of equal treatment to domestic and foreign investment.



The Foreign Investment Law of the People’s Republic of China, or the Foreign Investment Law was promulgated by the NPC in March 2019 and become effective in January 2020. After the Foreign Investment Law came into force, the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises, the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Sino-foreign Equity Joint Ventures and the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Sino-foreign Contractual Joint Ventures have been repealed simultaneously. The investment activities of foreign natural persons, enterprises or other organizations (hereinafter referred to as foreign investors) directly or indirectly within the territory of mainland China shall comply with and be governed by the Foreign Investment Law, including: 1) establishing by foreign investors of foreign-invested enterprises in mainland China alone or jointly with other investors; 2) acquiring by foreign investors of shares, equity, property shares, or other similar interests of Chinese domestic enterprises; 3) investing by foreign investors in new projects in mainland China alone or jointly with other investors; and 4) other forms of investment prescribed by laws, administrative regulations or the State Council.
