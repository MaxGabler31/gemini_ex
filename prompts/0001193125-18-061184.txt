 Item 1. Business
The Company is a Canadian corporation that was formed in March 1994 as a result of an amalgamation between WGIM Acquisition Corp. and the former IMAX Corporation (Predecessor IMAX). Predecessor IMAX was incorporated in 1967. 
GENERAL 
 The Company, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is one of the worlds leading entertainment technology companies, specializing in motion picture technologies and presentations. IMAX offers a unique end-to-end cinematic solution combining proprietary software, theater architecture and equipment to create the highest-quality, most immersive motion picture experience for which the IMAX® brand has become known globally. Top filmmakers and studios utilize IMAX theaters to connect with audiences in innovative ways, and as a result, IMAXs theater network is among the most important and successful theatrical distribution platforms for major event films around the world. 
 The Companys core business consists of: 
 

 | the Digital Re-Mastering (DMR) of films into the IMAX format for exhibition in the IMAX theater network in exchange for a certain percentage of contingent box office receipts from both studios and exhibitors; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the provision of IMAX premium theater systems (IMAX theater systems) to exhibitor customers through sales, long-term leases or joint revenue sharing arrangements.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 IMAX theater systems are based on proprietary and patented technology developed over the course of the Companys 50-year history. The Companys customers who purchase, lease or otherwise acquire the IMAX theater systems through joint revenue sharing arrangements are theater exhibitors that operate commercial theaters (particularly multiplexes), museums, science centers, or destination entertainment sites. The Company generally does not own IMAX theaters, but licenses the use of its trademarks along with the sale, lease or contribution of the IMAX theater system. The Company refers to all theaters using the IMAX theater system as IMAX theaters. 
 IMAX theater systems combine: 
 

 | the ability to exhibit content that has undergone IMAX DMR conversion, which results in higher image and sound fidelity than conventional cinema experiences;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | advanced, high-resolution projectors with specialized equipment and automated theater control systems, which generate significantly more contrast and brightness than conventional theater systems;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | large screens and proprietary theater geometry, which result in a substantially larger field of view so that the screen extends to the edge of a viewers peripheral vision and creates more realistic images;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | sound system components, which deliver more expansive sound imagery and pinpointed origination of sound to any specific spot in an IMAX theater;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | specialized theater acoustics, which result in a four-fold reduction in background noise; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a license to the globally recognized IMAX brand.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 Together these components cause audiences in IMAX theaters to feel as if they are a part of the on-screen action, creating a more intense, immersive and exciting experience than a traditional theater. 
 As a result of the immersiveness and superior image and sound quality of The IMAX Experience, the Companys exhibitor customers typically charge a premium for IMAX DMR films over films exhibited in their other auditoriums. The premium pricing, combined with the higher attendance levels associated with IMAX DMR films, generates incremental box-office for the Companys exhibitor customers and for the movie studios releasing their films to the IMAX theater network. The incremental box-office generated by IMAX DMR films has helped establish IMAX as a key premium distribution and marketing platform for Hollywood blockbuster films. 
 IMAX THEATER NETWORK 
 The Company believes the IMAX theater network is one of the most extensive premium theater networks in the world with 1,370 theater systems (1,272 commercial multiplex, 12 commercial destination, 86 institutional) operating in 75 countries as at December 31, 2017. 
 
4 
 
The Company believes that over time its commercial multiplex theater network could grow to approximately 2,855 IMAX theaters worldwide from the 1,272 commercial multiplex IMAX theaters in operation as of December 31, 2017. While the Company continues to grow in the United States and Canada, it believes that the majority of its future growth will come from international markets. As at December 31, 2017, 67.2% of IMAX theater systems in operation were located within international markets (defined as all countries other than the United States and Canada), up from 63.7% as at December 31, 2016, and approximately 90.2% of IMAX theater systems in backlog are scheduled to be installed in international markets, compared to 87.8% as at December 31, 2016. Revenues and gross box-office derived from outside the United States and Canada continue to exceed revenues and gross box-office from the United States and Canada. 
 Greater China continues to be the Companys second-largest market, measured by revenues, with approximately 33% of overall revenues generated from the Companys China operations in 2017. As at December 31, 2017, the Company had 544 theaters operating in Greater China and an additional 309 theaters in backlog that are scheduled to be installed in Greater China by 2022. The Companys backlog in Greater China represents 61.9% of the Companys current backlog. The Companys largest single international partnership is in China with Wanda Film, formerly Wanda Cinema Line Corporation (Wanda). Wandas total commitment to the Company is for 359 theater systems, of which 343 theater systems are under the parties joint revenue sharing arrangement. 
 In 2015, the Companys subsidiary, IMAX China Holding, Inc. (IMAX China), completed an initial public offering of its ordinary shares on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Limited (the IMAX China IPO). Following the IMAX China IPO, the Company continues to indirectly own approximately 67.93% of IMAX China, which remains a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. 
 PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 
 The Company believes it is the worlds largest designer and manufacturer of specialty premium projection and sound system components for large-format theaters around the world, as well as a significant producer and distributor of large-format films. The Companys theater systems include specialized IMAX projectors, advanced sound systems and specialty screens. 
 The Companys principal products and services are as follows: 
 

 | IMAX DMR: The Digital Re-Mastering of films into the IMAX format for exhibition in the IMAX theater network.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | IMAX Theater Systems: The provision of IMAX premium theater systems to exhibitor customers.

 These product lines do not reflect the nature and sources of revenue, or the manner in which management reviews financial information. The Companys segmented information is provided in Item 7 and note 18 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2017 (this 2017 Form 10-K), which is incorporated by reference into this Item I. 
 Digital Re-Mastering (IMAX DMR) 
 The Company has developed a proprietary technology, known as IMAX DMR, to digitally re-master Hollywood films into IMAX digital cinema package format or 15/70-format film for exhibition in IMAX theaters. IMAX DMR digitally enhances the image resolution of motion picture films for projection on IMAX screens while maintaining or enhancing the visual clarity and sound quality to levels for which The IMAX Experience is known. 
 The IMAX DMR process involves the following: 
 

 | in certain instances, scanning, at the highest possible resolution, each individual frame of the movie and converting it into a digital image;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | optimizing the image using proprietary image enhancement tools;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | enhancing the digital image using techniques such as sharpening, color correction, grain and noise removal and the elimination of unsteadiness and removal of unwanted artifacts;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | recording the enhanced digital image into an IMAX digital cinema package (DCP) format or onto IMAX 15/70-format film; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
5 
 

 | specially re-mastering the sound track to take full advantage of the unique sound system of IMAX theater systems.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The original soundtrack of a film to be exhibited in the IMAX theater network is re-mastered for the IMAX digital sound systems in connection with the IMAX DMR release. Unlike the soundtracks played in conventional theaters, IMAX re-mastered soundtracks are uncompressed and full fidelity. IMAX sound systems use proprietary loudspeaker systems and proprietary surround sound configurations that ensure every theater seat is in an optimal listening position. 
 IMAX films also benefit from enhancements made by individual filmmakers exclusively for the IMAX release, and filmmakers and studios have sought IMAX-specific enhancements in recent years to generate interest in and excitement for their films. Such enhancements include shooting select scenes with IMAX cameras to increase the audiences immersion in the film and taking advantage of the unique dimensions of the IMAX screen by projecting the film in a larger aspect ratio. In addition, the upcoming films Marvels Avengers: Infinity War and the Untitled Avengers Sequel are expected to be shot in their entireties using IMAX cameras. 
 In 2017, 60 films were converted through the IMAX DMR process and released to theaters in the IMAX network by film studios as compared to 51 films in 2016. In addition, in 2017, in conjunction with Marvel and Disney|ABC Television Group, the Company co-produced and exclusively premiered theatrically the television series Marvels Inhumans in IMAX theaters. 
 To date, the Company has announced the following 31 DMR titles to be released in 2018 to the IMAX theater network:

The Company remains in active negotiations with all of the major Hollywood studios for additional films to fill out its short and long-term film slate, and anticipates that the number of IMAX DMR films to be released to the IMAX theater network in 2018 will be similar to the 60 IMAX DMR films released to the IMAX theater network in 2017. 
 IMAX Systems 
 The Companys primary products are its theater systems. The Companys digital projection systems include a projector that offers superior image quality and stability and a digital theater control system; a digital audio system delivering up to 12,000 watts of sound; a screen with a proprietary coating technology, and, if applicable, 3D glasses cleaning equipment. IMAXs digital projection system also operates without the need for analog film prints. Traditional IMAX film-based theater systems contain the same components as the digital projection systems but include a rolling loop 15/70-format projector and require the use of analog film prints. Since its introduction in 2008, the vast majority of the Companys theater sales have been digital systems. Furthermore, a majority of the Companys existing film-based theater systems have been upgraded, at a cost to the exhibitor, to an IMAX digital system. As part of the arrangement to sell or lease its theater systems, the Company provides extensive advice on theater planning and design and supervision of installation services. Theater systems are also leased or sold with a license for the use of the globally recognized IMAX brand. 
 The Companys digital projection system provides a premium and differentiated experience to moviegoers that is consistent with what they have come to expect from the IMAX brand, while providing for the compelling economics and flexibility that digital technology affords. 
 The terms of each arrangement vary according to the configuration of the theater system provided, the cinema market and the film distribution market relevant to the geographic location of the customer. 
 Revenue from theater business arrangements is recognized at a different time from when cash is collected. See Critical Accounting Policies in Item 7 for further discussion on the Companys revenue recognition policies. 
 IMAX Theater Backlog and Network 
 The Companys sales backlog is as follows:

 | Number ofSystems | | | FixedContractualDollar Value(in thousands) | | | Number ofSystems | FixedContractualDollar Value(in thousands) |

----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Includes 20 laser-based digital theater system configurations, including 3 upgrades.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The number of theater systems in the backlog reflects the minimum number of commitments under signed contracts. The dollar value fluctuates depending on the number of new theater system arrangements signed from year to year, which adds to backlog and the installation and acceptance of theater systems and the settlement of contracts, both of which reduce backlog. Sales backlog typically represents the fixed contracted revenue under signed theater system sale and lease agreements that the Company believes will be recognized as revenue upon installation and acceptance of the associated theater. Sales backlog includes initial fees along with the estimated present value of contractual ongoing fees due over the term, however it excludes amounts allocated to maintenance and extended warranty revenues as well as fees (contingent fees) in excess of contractual ongoing fees that may be received in the future. 
 
7 
 
 The value of sales backlog does not include revenue from theaters in which the Company has an equity interest, operating leases, letters of intent or long-term conditional theater commitments. The value of theaters under joint revenue sharing arrangements is excluded from the dollar value of sales backlog, although certain theater systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements provide for contracted upfront payments and therefore carry a backlog value based on those payments. The Company believes that the contractual obligations for theater system installations that are listed in sales backlog are valid and binding commitments. 
 From time to time, in the normal course of its business, the Company will have customers who are unable to proceed with a theater system installation for a variety of reasons, including the inability to obtain certain consents, approvals or financing. Once the determination is made that the customer will not proceed with installation, the agreement with the customer is terminated or amended. If the agreement is terminated, once the Company and the customer are released from all their future obligations under the agreement, all or a portion of the initial rents or fees that the customer previously made to the Company are recognized as revenue. 
 The following chart shows the number of the Companys theater systems by configuration, opened theater network and backlog as at December 31:

 The Company estimates that it will install approximately 145 new theater systems (excluding upgrades) in 2018. The Company cautions, however, that theater system installations may slip from period to period over the course of the Companys business, usually for reasons beyond its control. 
 IMAX theater systems consist of the following configurations: 
 IMAX Digital: Xenon Theater Systems. The vast majority of the Companys theater system signings have been for the Companys proprietary xenon-based digital systems. The Company believes that its xenon-based digital projection system delivers high quality imagery compared with other digital systems. As at December 31, 2017, the Company had installed 1,250 xenon-based digital theater systems and has an additional 467 xenon-based digital theater systems in its backlog. 
 IMAX Digital: Laser Theater Systems. The Company introduced its laser-based digital projection system at the end of 2014. The Company believes the IMAX laser-based digital projectors present greater brightness and clarity, higher contrast, a wider color gamut and deeper blacks, and consume less power and last longer than existing digital technology, capable of illuminating the largest screens in the IMAX theater network. As at December 31, 2017, the Company had installed 51 laser-based digital systems. The Company is in the process of developing an updated laser-based projection system, which is targeted primarily for screens in commercial multiplexes. 
 IMAX Flat Screen and IMAX Dome Theater Systems. IMAX flat screen and IMAX dome systems primarily have been installed in institutions such as museums and science centers. Flat screen IMAX theaters were introduced in 1970, while IMAX dome theaters, which are designed for tilted dome screens, were introduced in 1973. There have been several significant proprietary and patented enhancements to these systems since their introduction. As at December 31, 2017, there were 48 IMAX flat screen and IMAX dome theater systems in the IMAX network, as compared to 56 IMAX flat screen and IMAX dome theater systems as at December 31, 2016. With the introduction of the IMAX digital theater systems, there has been a decrease in the number of IMAX flat screen and IMAX dome theater systems in the network. 
 
8 
 
IMAX 3D GT and IMAX 3D SR Theater Systems. IMAX 3D theaters utilize a flat screen 3D system, which produces realistic 3D images on an IMAX screen. As at December 31, 2017, there were 21 IMAX 3D GT and IMAX 3D SR theater systems in operation compared to 27 IMAX 3D GT and IMAX 3D SR theater systems in operation as at December 31, 2016. The decrease in the number of 3D GT and 3D SR theater systems is largely attributable to the conversion of existing 3D GT and 3D SR theater systems to IMAX digital theater systems. 
 New Business Initiatives 
 The Company is exploring new lines of business outside of its core business, with a focus on alternative location-based entertainment experiences, investments in original content, as well as premium IMAX home entertainment technologies and services.
Virtual Reality 
 The Company is piloting a comprehensive virtual reality (VR) strategy to develop a premium, location-based VR offering that delivers immersive, multi-dimensional experiences, including entertainment content and games, to branded VR centers (IMAX VR Centers). Pilot IMAX VR Centers are located in a stand-alone venue and in several multiplexes, and are retrofitted with proprietary VR pods that permit interactive, moveable VR experiences. The Companys VR initiative is premised on a unique combination of premium content, proprietary design and best-in-class technology. 
 In January 2017, the Company launched its flagship pilot IMAX VR Center in Los Angeles. Since that time, the Company has opened six pilot IMAX VR Centers (two in New York City, one in Toronto, one in Manchester, England, one in Shanghai, China and one in Bangkok, Thailand.) The Company continues to evaluate its pilot VR strategy based on several factors, including the overall customer experience, pricing models, throughput, types of content featured and differences in geographic areas. 
 The Company has also established a virtual reality fund (the VR Fund) among the Company, its subsidiary IMAX China and other strategic investors. The VR Fund will help finance the creation of interactive VR content experiences over the next three years for use across all VR platforms, including in the pilot IMAX VR Centers. The VR Fund recently helped finance the production of one interactive VR experience, which debuted exclusively in the pilot IMAX VR Centers in November 2017 before being made available to other VR platforms. 
 Original Content 
 In 2017, the Company partnered with Marvel Television Inc. (Marvel) and Disney|ABC Television Group to co-produce and premiere theatrically the television series Marvels Inhumans in IMAX theaters. The first two episodes of the series ran worldwide in IMAX theaters for two weeks in September 2017 and subsequently the series premiered on the ABC network in the U.S. and across other networks internationally. As part of the investment, the Company shares in the economics across the venture, including in both the theatrical and television platforms. 
 The Company continues to believe that the IMAX network serves as a valuable platform to launch and distribute original content, especially during shoulder periods. However, the Company expects that future investments in original content will be less capital intensive to the Company than its investment in Marvels Inhumans. 
 The Company has also created two film funds to help finance the production of original content. The Company is forming the IMAX China Film Fund (the China Film Fund) with its subsidiary IMAX China Holding Inc. (IMAX China), its partner CMC and several other large investors to help fund Mandarin language commercial films. The China Film Fund, which is expected initially to be capitalized with over $80.0 million, will target productions that can leverage the Companys brand, relationships, technology and release windows in China. The China Film Fund is expected to co-finance approximately 15 Mandarin-language tent-pole films over three years, and will target contributions of between $3.0 million and $7.0 million per film. The China Film Fund will operate under an IMAX China-CMC controlled greenlight committee. 
 In addition, the Companys IMAX Original Film Fund (the Original Film Fund) was established in 2014 to co-finance a portfolio of 10 original large format films. The Original Film Fund, which is intended to be capitalized with up to $50.0 million, will finance an ongoing supply of original films that the Company believes will be more exciting and compelling than traditional documentaries. The initial investment in the Film Fund was committed to by a third party in the amount of $25.0 million, with the possibility of contributing additional funds. The Company agreed to contribute $9.0 million to the Original Film Fund over five years starting in 2014 and sees the Original Film Fund as a self-perpetuating vehicle designed to generate a continuous flow of high-quality documentary content. As at December 31, 2017, the Original Film Fund has invested $13.4 million toward the development of original films.

IMAX Home Entertainment Technologies and Services 
 The Company has also announced home theater initiatives, including a joint venture with TCL Multimedia Technology Holding Limited (TCL) to design, develop, manufacture and sell a premium home theater system. The joint venture has signed agreements with end users for the sale of more than 170 premium home theater systems, and has signed agreements with distributors for the sale of more than 470 home theater systems. The Company does not intend to invest significant capital into the joint venture going forward, and instead expects any additional funding to be provided through third party capital. 
 Beyond its premium home theater, the Company has also developed other components of a broader home entertainment platform designed to permit customers to view content on a premium video-on-demand basis in their home theaters. 
 Other 
 The Company is also a distributor of large-format films, primarily for its institutional theater partners. 
 Films produced by the Company are typically financed through third parties, whereby the Company will generally receive a film production fee in exchange for producing the film and a distribution fee for distributing the film. The ownership rights to such films may be held by the film sponsors, the film investors and/or the Company. As at December 31, 2017, the Company currently has distribution rights with respect to 46 of such films, which cover such subjects such as space, wildlife, music, history and natural wonders. 
 Several more recent large-format films that have been distributed by the Company include: A Beautiful Planet, which was released in April 2016 and has grossed over $19.3 million as at the end of 2017; Voyage of Time, which was released in October 2016 and has grossed over $0.5 million as at the end of 2017; Island of Lemurs: Madagascar, which was released in April 2014 and has grossed over $13.8 million as at the end of 2017; Journey to the South Pacific, which was released in 2013 has grossed $13.6 million as at the end of 2017. Large-format films have significantly longer exhibition periods than conventional commercial films and many of the films in the large-format library have remained popular for many decades, including the films SPACE STATION, Hubble 3D and T-REX: Back to the Cretaceous. 
 The Company also provides film post-production and quality control services for large-format films (whether produced internally or externally), and digital post-production services. 
 As at December 31, 2017, the Company had two owned and operated IMAX theaters (December 31, 2016  two owned and operated IMAX theaters). In addition, the Company has a commercial arrangement with one theater resulting in the sharing of profits and losses and provides management services to three other theaters. The Company also rents its proprietary 2D and 3D large-format film and digital cameras to third party production companies. The Company maintains cameras and other film equipment and also offers production advice and technical assistance to both documentary and Hollywood filmmakers. 
 MARKETING AND CUSTOMERS 
 The Company markets its theater systems through a direct sales force and marketing staff located in offices in Canada, the United States, Greater China, Europe and Asia. In addition, the Company has agreements with consultants, business brokers and real estate professionals to locate potential customers and theater sites for the Company on a commission basis. 
 The commercial multiplex theater segment of the IMAX theater network is the Companys largest segment, comprising 1,272 IMAX theaters, or 92.8%, of the 1,370 IMAX theaters open as at December 31, 2017. The Companys institutional customers include science and natural history museums, zoos, aquaria and other educational and cultural centers. The Company also sells or leases its theater systems to theme parks, private home theaters, tourist destination sites, fairs and expositions (the Commercial Destination segment). At December 31, 2017, approximately 67.2% of all opened IMAX theaters were in locations outside of the United States and Canada.

 INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 
 Competition 
 The out-of-home entertainment industry is very competitive, and the Company faces a number of competitive challenges. In recent years, for instance, exhibitors and entertainment technology companies have introduced their own branded, large-screen 3D auditoriums or other proprietary theater systems, some of which include laser-based projectors, and in many cases, have marketed those auditoriums or theater systems as having the same quality or attributes as an IMAX theater. The Company believes that all of these alternative formats deliver images and experiences that are inferior to The IMAX Experience. 
 The Company may continue to face competition in the future from companies in the entertainment industry with new technologies and/or substantially greater capital resources to develop and support them. The Company also faces in-home competition from a number of alternative motion picture distribution channels such as home video, pay-per-view, streaming services, video-on-demand, DVD, Internet and syndicated and broadcast television. The Company further competes for the publics leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including gaming, sporting events, concerts, live theater, social media and restaurants. 
 The Company believes that its competitive strengths include the value of the IMAX brand name, the premium IMAX consumer experience, the design, quality and historic reliability rate of IMAX theater systems, the return on investment of an IMAX theater, the number and quality of IMAX films that it distributes, the relationships the Company maintains with prominent Hollywood and international filmmakers, a number of whom desire to film portions of their movies with IMAX cameras, the quality of the sound system components included with the IMAX theater, the availability of Hollywood and international event films to IMAX theaters through IMAX DMR technology, consumer loyalty and the level of the Companys service and maintenance and extended warranty efforts. The Company believes that its laser-based projection system increases further the technological superiority of the consumer experience it delivers. As a result, the Company believes that virtually all of the best performing premium theaters in the world are IMAX theaters.

Exhibitor Consolidation 
 The Companys primary customers are commercial multiplex exhibitors. The commercial exhibition industry has undergone significant consolidation in recent years, with Dalian Wandas acquisitions of AMC and Hoyts Group in 2012 and 2015, respectively, and AMCs acquisition of Carmike Cinemas and Odeon & UCI Cinemas Group (Odeon), which includes Nordic Cinema Group (Nordic), in 2016. The industry continues to consolidate, as evidenced by Cineworld Groups planned acquisition of Regal Entertainment Group, the Companys second largest customer. 
 The Company believes that recent exhibitor consolidation has helped facilitate the growth of the Companys theater network. The Company has historically enjoyed strong relationships with large commercial exhibitor chains, which have greater capital to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire IMAX theater systems. As larger commercial chains such as AMC have purchased smaller chains, those smaller chains have in turn become part of the IMAX theater network. For instance, following AMCs acquisition of Odeon and Nordic, the Company and AMC entered into an agreement for 25 new IMAX theater systems across the Odeon and Nordic theater network. This deal represented the largest single European agreement in the Companys history. The Company believes that continued consolidation could facilitate further signings and other strategic benefits going forward. 
 However, exhibitor consolidation has also resulted in individual exhibitor chains constituting a material portion of the Companys revenue and network. Continued industry consolidation (as well as consolidation in the movie studio industry) may present risks to the Company. See Risk Factors in Item 1.A of this 2017 Form 10-K.
THE IMAX BRAND 
 IMAX is a world leader in entertainment technology. The Company relies on its brand to communicate its leadership and singular goal of creating entertainment experiences that exceed all expectations. Top filmmakers and studios use the IMAX brand to message that a film will connect with audiences in unique and extraordinary ways. The IMAX brand is a promise to deliver what todays movie audiences crave  a memorable, more emotionally engaging, more thrilling and shareable experience. Consumer research conducted in six countries worldwide by a leading third-party research firm shows that the IMAX brand has near universal awareness, creates a special experience and is one of the most differentiated movie-going brands. On a standardized measure of brand equity, the IMAX brand ranged from two to 10 times more powerful than other exhibition and entertainment technology brands. The Company believes that its strong brand equity supports consumers predisposition to choose IMAX over competing brands and to pay a premium for The IMAX Experience now and into the future. 
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 The Company believes that it is one of the worlds leading entertainment technology companies with significant proprietary expertise in digital and film-based projection and sound system component design, engineering and imaging technology, particularly in laser-based technology. In recent years, the Company has increased its level of research and development in order to develop laser-based projection systems. The Company rolled out its laser-based projection system at the end of 2014, which is capable of illuminating the largest screens in the Companys network. The laser-based projection system provides greater brightness and clarity, higher contrast, a wider color gamut and deeper blacks, while consuming less power and lasting longer than existing digital technology, to ensure that the Company continues to provide the highest quality, premier movie going experience available to consumers. However, the Company has experienced lower than expected margins from the installation of these laser-based projection systems. As a result, over the past several years, the Company has focused its research and development efforts on an updated laser-based projection system, which is targeted primarily for screens in commercial multiplexes. 
 Recent research and development activity has also focused on the exploration of a comprehensive VR strategy to deliver immersive and interactive experiences to consumers through pilot IMAX VR Centers. The Company also has made progress deploying its proprietary expertise in image technology and 3D technology, as well as its proprietary film content and the IMAX brand, for applications in its in-home entertainment technology initiatives, including its premium home theater system with TCL. The premium home theater system incorporates 4K projection technology, together with security and delivery technology to enable the viewing of current theatrical releases that have been digitally re-mastered with IMAX enhancement technology. 
 Going forward, the Company plans to continue research and development activity in the future in other areas considered important to the Companys continued commercial success, including further improving the reliability of its projectors; enhancing the Companys 2D and 3D image quality; expanding the applicability of the Companys digital technology; developing IMAX theater systems capabilities; and improving the Companys proprietary tuning system and mastering processes. Furthermore, due to the increasing

 success major Hollywood filmmakers have experienced with IMAX cameras, the Company has identified the development and manufacture of additional IMAX cameras as an important research and development initiative. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Company recorded research and development expenses of $20.9 million, $16.3 million and $12.7 million, respectively. As at December 31, 2017, 81 of the Companys employees were connected with research and development projects. 
 MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE 
 Projector Component Manufacturing 
 The Company assembles the projector of its theater systems at its office in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (near Toronto). The Company develops and designs all of the key elements of the proprietary technology involved in this component. Fabrication of a majority of parts and sub-assemblies is subcontracted to a group of carefully pre-qualified third-party suppliers. Manufacture and supply contracts are signed for the delivery of the component on an order-by-order basis. The Company believes its significant suppliers will continue to supply quality products in quantities sufficient to satisfy its needs. The Company inspects all parts and sub-assemblies, completes the final assembly and then subjects the projector to comprehensive testing individually and as a system prior to shipment. In 2017, these projectors, including both the Companys xenon and laser-based projection systems, had reliability rates based on scheduled shows of approximately 99.9%. 
Sound System Component Manufacturing 
 The Company develops, designs and assembles the key elements of its theater sound system component. The standard IMAX theater sound system component comprises parts from a variety of sources, with approximately 50% of the materials of each sound system attributable to proprietary parts provided under original equipment manufacturers agreements with outside vendors. These proprietary parts include custom loudspeaker enclosures and horns, specialized amplifiers, and signal processing and control equipment. The Company inspects all parts and sub-assemblies, completes the final assembly and then subjects the sound system component to comprehensive testing individually and as a system prior to shipment. 
 Screen and Other Components 
 The Company purchases its screen component and glasses cleaning equipment from third parties. The standard screen system component is comprised of a projection screen manufactured to IMAX specifications and a frame to hang the projection screen. The proprietary glasses cleaning machine is a stand-alone unit that is connected to the theaters water and electrical supply to automate the cleaning of 3D glasses. 
Maintenance and Extended Warranty Services 
 The Company also provides ongoing maintenance and extended warranty services to IMAX theater systems. These arrangements are usually for a separate fee, although the Company often includes free service in the initial year of an arrangement. The maintenance and extended warranty arrangements include service, maintenance and replacement parts for theater systems. 
 To support the IMAX theater network, the Company has personnel stationed in major markets throughout the world who provide periodic and emergency maintenance and extended warranty services on existing theater systems. The Company provides various levels of maintenance and warranty services, which are priced accordingly. Under full service programs, Company personnel typically visit each theater every six months to provide preventative maintenance, cleaning and inspection services and emergency visits to resolve problems and issues with the theater system. Under some arrangements, customers can elect to participate in a service partnership program whereby the Company trains a customers technician to carry out certain aspects of maintenance. Under such shared maintenance arrangements, the Company participates in certain of the customers maintenance checks each year, provides a specified number of emergency visits and provides spare parts, as necessary. For both xenon and laser-based digital systems, the Company provides pre-emptive maintenance, remote system monitoring and a network operations center that provides continuous access to product experts.
