ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
SolarWinds is a leading provider of simple, powerful and secure information technology, or IT, management software. Our solutions give organizations worldwide, regardless of type, size or complexity, the power to accelerate business transformation in today's hybrid IT environments. We combine customer-driven products with an "inside-first" sales model to grow our business while also generating significant cash flow. 
Our business is focused on building products that enable technology professionals to manage “all things IT.” We continuously engage with technology professionals to understand the challenges they face maintaining high-performing and highly available IT infrastructures - whether they be on-premises, in the cloud, or both. The insights we gain from engaging with technology professionals allow us to build products that solve well-understood IT management challenges in ways that technology professionals want them solved. We sell a comprehensive portfolio of IT management products that are designed for ITOps, DevOps, SecOps and IT security professionals. 
 Our approach, which we call the “SolarWinds Model,” enables us to market and sell our products directly to network and systems engineers, database administrators, storage administrators, DevOps, SecOps and service desk professionals. These technology professionals have become empowered to influence the selection, and often the purchase, of products needed to rapidly solve the problems they confront. We also have the opportunity to engage in conversations at a more strategic level with senior leaders and C-suite executives in charge of IT environments and business applications.
We serve the entire IT market uniquely and efficiently with our SolarWinds Model. Technology professionals use our products in organizations ranging in size from very small businesses to large enterprises. Our products are designed to do the complex work of monitoring and managing networks, systems, databases and applications across on-premises, cloud and hybrid IT environments without the need for customization or professional services. Many of our products are built on common technology platforms that enable our customers to easily purchase and deploy our products individually or as an integrated offering as their needs evolve. We utilize a cost-efficient, integrated global product development model and have expanded our offerings over time through both organic development and strategic acquisitions. 
We market and sell our products directly to technology professionals primarily through a high-velocity, low-touch, digital marketing and direct inside sales approach that we call “selling from the inside.” We have built a highly flexible and analytics-driven marketing model designed to efficiently drive website traffic and high-quality leads. Our sales team uses a prescriptive approach designed to manage these leads and quickly sell our products pursuant to our standard pricing and contract terms. In addition to our high-velocity model, we are also evolving our sales motion with a targeted, high-touch Enterprise sales team and Customer Success motion that is designed to elevate and drive higher-level strategic conversations and opportunities within key customer accounts. As we build upon and evolve our sales motion, we also intend to grow our partner relationships and routes to market. 
We also engage with both existing and prospective customers using a variety of interaction points including our Customer Success Managers and our online community, THWACK. The community is designed to train and inform technology professionals about our products, keep us connected to them and provide network effects to amplify word-of-mouth marketing for our products. 
Technology professionals often find our products when they are online searching for a solution to address a specific need and use our full-featured trials to experience our purpose-built, powerful and easy to use products in their own environments. These experiences often lead to initial purchases of one or more products and, over time, purchases of additional products and advocacy within both their organizations and their networks of technology professionals. 
We have grown while maintaining high levels of operating efficiency. We currently derive our revenue from a combination of subscription revenue from the sale of application performance management and service desk products, and license and maintenance revenue from the sale of our on-premises network and IT operations management perpetual license products. Over time, we have significantly increased our subscription and maintenance revenue and intend to grow our revenue and cash flow by gaining new customers, increasing penetration within our existing customer base, expanding our international footprint, bringing new products to market and expanding into new markets through organic development and targeted acquisitions.
SolarWinds Corporation was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 2015.
Cyber Incident
On December 14, 2020, we announced that we had been the victim of a cyberattack on our Orion Software Platform and internal systems, or the “Cyber Incident.” For further information about the Cyber Incident, see “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Cyber Incident” included in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Spin-Off of N-able Business 
On July 19, 2021, we completed the previously announced separation and distribution of our managed service provider (“MSP” or “N-able”) business into a newly created and separately traded public company, N-able, Inc. We refer to this transaction as the “Separation.” The Separation was completed by means of a distribution in which each holder of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, received one share of N‑able’s common stock, par value $0.001, for every two shares of our common stock held of record as of the close of business on July 12, 2021. After the Separation, we do not beneficially own any shares of common stock in N-able and no longer consolidate N‑able into our financial results for periods ending after July 19, 2021. As a result, N‑able's historical financial results through the Separation are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. 
We incurred significant costs in connection with the Separation which we refer to as “spin-off costs.” We incurred $31.6 million and $12.2 million of costs in connection with the Separation during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are primarily reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Of these amounts, the spin-off costs included in continuing operations were $4.4 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
See Note 3. Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of the Separation. 
The SolarWinds Model
At the heart of everything we do as a company is the SolarWinds Model, which consists of five principles that guide our business and help explain why technology professionals choose our products:
Focus on the Technology Professional
We are committed to understanding technology professionals and the daily challenges that they face managing the complex, ever-changing demands of business-critical IT environments. We have a substantial customer base and community of technology professionals. We engage with them daily through digital marketing, Customer Success programs and online communications, including through THWACK, our online community that provides forums to registered members, tools and valuable resources. We also manage several company-sponsored blogs in which we provide perspectives and information relevant to the IT management market, as well as web-based events designed to train and inform participants about deeper aspects of our products. We don’t have to guess about what technology professionals need, we just ask.
Build Great Products for the Entire Market
Organizations of all sizes have complex IT environments that make managing IT challenging. Our commitment to technology professionals allows us to deliver products that solve well-understood IT problems with simple, powerful and secure solutions for the entire market, from very small businesses to the largest of global enterprises, regardless of whether their IT is located on premises, in the public or private cloud, or some combination of all.
We design our products to be easy to access, try, buy, deploy and use. Many of our products are built on common technology platforms that enable our customers to purchase and implement our products individually, and then add additional product or products as needed. Or they can buy multiple products as an integrated offering. This allows customers to buy what they need, when they need it, and grow as their needs evolve.
Capture Demand Using Cost-Efficient, Mass-Reach Digital Marketing
Over the past decade, we have honed our use of digital marketing and online tools to find, communicate with and sell to potential customers of all levels of sophistication with environments of all levels of complexity and size. They are online every day interacting with their peers, learning about new technologies and searching for solutions to their problems. We believe we build credibility and confidence in our products by being present and active in the communities and on the sites that technology professionals trust.
Selling from the Inside
We are committed to selling from the inside. We adhere to a prescriptive process and metrics-based approach that drives predictability and consistency and has helped us add new customers and grow our relationships with existing customers.
The size and organization of our sales force enables us to reach thousands of technology professionals each day. We close the smallest and most simple transactions to our largest and most complex deals efficiently without the need for a traditional outside sales force, product customization or professional services. Our sales team uses a prescriptive approach designed to manage leads and quickly sell our products pursuant to our standardized pricing and contract terms. We believe our selling motion reflects how our customers prefer to do business. 
We also recognize that the preferences technology professional have may not always match those of the senior leadership in their organization, and we are addressing these additional audiences and sales motions in our growth strategies described below.
Focus on the Long-Term Value of the Relationship with Our Customers
When our customers experience the value of our products, our investment in our product portfolio and our responsiveness to their changing needs, they often expand their relationship with us and become our advocates within both their organizations and their networks of technology professionals. The power of our approach is evidenced by the long-term relationships we have with our customers which is reflected in our strong customer retention rates. 
Growth Strategies
We intend to extend our leadership in IT infrastructure management and grow our market share in adjacent areas of IT operations with simple, powerful and secure solutions designed to manage “all things IT” across multi-cloud environments. The following are key elements of our land, adopt, expand and retain growth strategy:
Win New Customers Using the SolarWinds Model
The SolarWinds Model allows us to win new customers in existing markets where our products and our model give us a competitive advantage. Our efficient marketing and sales model and powerful brand recognition and trust among IT professionals have enabled us to increase our customer base. We intend to leverage our ability to efficiently attract new customers to continue to increase our overall customer base.
Increase Penetration Within Our Existing Customer Base
Many of our internal IT customers make an initial purchase to meet an immediate need, such as network or application performance monitoring in a small portion of their IT infrastructure, and then subsequently purchase additional products for other use cases or expansion across their organization. Once our customers have used our products within their IT environment, we are well positioned to help identify additional products that offer further value to those customers. We continue to refine our sales effort to better target our marketing and sales efforts and expand the sales of our products within organizations, particularly those that have multiple purchasers of our IT management products.  
Increase Our International Footprint
We believe a substantial market opportunity exists to increase our international footprint across all of our product lines. In particular, our application performance management and service desk products, which are currently sold primarily in North America, have strong international expansion potential. We have made significant investments in recent years to increase our sales and marketing operations internationally, and expect to continue to invest to grow our international sales and global brand awareness. 
Continue to Innovate
We intend to continue focusing on innovation and bringing new products and tools to market that address problems that technology professionals are asking us to solve. We also intend to continue providing frequent feature releases to our existing products. We are focused on enhancing the overall integration of our products to improve our value proposition and allow our customers to further benefit from expanding their usage of our products as their needs evolve.
Expand into New Markets Aligned with the SolarWinds Model and Our Evolving Sales Motion 
We have successfully entered new markets and expanded our product offerings to solve a broader set of challenges for customers. For example, in recent years we broadened our product offerings to address the database, storage, cloud and service desk markets. We intend to further expand into markets where our SolarWinds Model provides us with competitive advantages. In addition, as we seek to capture more expansion opportunities within our large customer base and better visibility within key 
enterprise accounts, we have also added programs and technologies to support an account-based marketing motion which is designed to allow us to elevate the SolarWinds value proposition and establish a more strategic conversation with critical personas, including those individuals in senior leadership roles and the C-suite. 
Pursue Targeted Acquisitions of Products and Technologies
We have successfully acquired and integrated businesses and technologies in the past that provided us with new product offerings and capabilities and helped us to establish positions in new segments and markets. We intend to continue making targeted acquisitions that complement and strengthen our product portfolio and capabilities or provide access to new markets. We evaluate acquisition opportunities to assess whether they will be successful within the SolarWinds Model. We believe our ability to effectively transition acquired companies and products to the SolarWinds Model represents a unique opportunity for our business.
Our Customers and Market
We designed the SolarWinds Model to reach all sizes of businesses. Our customers represent organizations ranging in size from very small businesses to large enterprises. Customers often initially purchase one of our products to solve a known problem and then expand their purchases over time. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had over 300,000 customers after giving effect to the Separation. We define customers as individuals or entities that have purchased one or more of our products under a unique customer identification number since our inception for our perpetual license products and individuals or entities that have an active subscription for at least one of our subscription products. Each unique customer identification number constitutes a separate customer regardless of the amount purchased. We may have multiple purchasers of our products within a single organization, each of which may be assigned a unique customer identification number and deemed a separate customer. 
The SolarWinds Model allows us to both sell to a broad group of potential customers and close large transactions with significant customers. 
Organizations across industries are using technology and software to drive business transformation and competitive differentiation. As the landscape for IT infrastructure and software deployment worldwide rapidly changes to meet businesses’ evolving needs, the performance, speed, availability and security of IT has become critical to business strategy. The job of the technology professionals who deploy and manage these environments is more challenging than ever. 
Growing IT Complexity Creates Significant Challenges for Organizations
Technology professionals face more complexity than ever before in the form of the recent, sudden shifts in how people work, an ever evolving and expanding threat landscape and application modernization and multi-cloud environments, all while managing the realities of budget and resource constraints.
As organizations deploy and rely on a mix of on-premises, public and private cloud and hybrid IT environments to support their business transformations, they require performance monitoring and management solutions that work across their increasingly complex environments and provide full visibility into performance of the entire IT stack. 
Empowerment of the Technology Professional
The technology professionals charged with managing these infrastructures are increasingly responsible for making technology choices to help ensure the performance of their IT infrastructure meets the needs of the business. Additionally, the democratization of IT spend has shifted influence in software purchase decisions from the highest levels of an organization’s IT department to technology professionals, who can have different perspectives from CIOs or other IT decision-makers. We have found that technology professionals prefer to trial software products in real time to determine if the products meet their needs. They also want the flexibility to select from a range of IT management products to find those best suited to address their specific challenges. In this environment, technology professionals are among the biggest influencers of software-purchasing decisions within their organizations. 
Limitations of Alternative Solutions
Alternative IT management solutions have limitations that impair their ability to efficiently serve the unique needs of technology professionals. These solutions can be expensive, complicated and inflexible and may require significant professional services to customize, implement, operate and maintain.
Given the challenges associated with operating across a complex range of dynamic, hybrid IT environments and the limited ability of existing solutions to address these challenges in the ways that technology professionals want them addressed, we believe there is a significant market opportunity for broad hybrid IT management solutions purpose-built to serve the needs of technology professionals. 
Product Portfolio and Technology Platforms
We offer a broad portfolio of products to monitor and manage network, systems, desktop, application, storage, database, website infrastructures and IT service desks. We intend to continue to innovate and invest in areas of product development that bring new products to market and enhance the functionality, ease of use and integration of our current products. In addition, as part of our "Secure by Design" framework, we have made adaptations and enhancements to the security of our internal environment, software development processes and deployment of our products, including securing our environment and systems, adopting zero trust and least privilege access mechanisms, addressing the possible risks associated with third-party applications access and redesigning our automated build process to help ensure the security and integrity of our products. We may also introduce new technology through relationships with other technology companies. We believe this will strengthen the overall value proposition of our products in any IT environment. 
Our product development is guided by principles that provide a development framework that allows us to respond quickly to the market and deliver a broad suite of products designed to solve problems that are commonly understood and shared by our customers. Our core product development principles are:
1.We purpose-build products for technology professionals. 
2.Our roadmaps are guided by a large community of users rather than by a select few large customers.
3.We develop products that are intended to sell themselves and be easy to use, powerful and immediately valuable to users. 
4.We design and develop our products to integrate and complement each other while providing a consistent user experience. 
We believe we have one of the broader product portfolios of IT monitoring and management software across the industry, providing deep visibility into network, systems, desktop, application, storage, database, website infrastructures, and virtual resources performance. Our products monitor applications and their supporting infrastructure, regardless of whether that infrastructure is located on-premises, in the cloud or in a hybrid model. Our products monitor applications in the cloud via an agent, agentlessly, or by using information from cloud providers’ APIs.
IT Management Portfolio
Targeted for ITOps, DevOps, SecOps and IT Security Professionals, our IT management products provide hybrid IT performance management with deep visibility into applications, IT infrastructures, and the full IT stack, while remaining infrastructure-location agnostic. Our comprehensive product portfolio covers the needs of all IT professionals and their hybrid IT environments. A one-stop shop for IT management, our product capabilities include network management, infrastructure management, application performance management, IT service management and IT security. 
Our suite of network management software provides real-time visibility into network utilization and bandwidth as well as the ability to quickly detect, diagnose and resolve network performance problems. Our suite of infrastructure management products monitors and analyzes the performance of applications and their supporting infrastructure, including websites, servers, physical, virtual and cloud infrastructure, storage and databases. We also help our customers strengthen their security and compliance posture with our automated network configuration, backup and log and event management products. 
Our suite of application performance management software enables visibility into log data, cloud infrastructure metrics, applications, tracing, and web performance management.
Our service management software provides a robust and easy-to use comprehensive, ITIL-compliant service desk solution for companies of all sizes. We help our customers manage their employee service challenge needs whether through simple ticketing or a powerful service desk solution, removing the manual burden of managing incoming tickets and tracking technology assets with the products cutting-edge automation, artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities.
Evolving from Monitoring to Observability 
Specialized monitoring solutions will continue to be relevant and needed to support customers' requirements, but to address the growing challenges faced by technology professionals, including rapidly increasing complexity, we also believe that we must evolve and further integrate, and extend, these point products into a robust and extensive Observability offering. 
SolarWinds Observability solutions will be based on a functionally scalable platform that will combine configuration, visualization and remediation capabilities in addition to standard observability - metrics, traces and logs - across infrastructure, databases and applications. The multi-cloud capabilities are designed to provide our customers with deployment and procurement flexibility and by integrating AIOps and our service desk software onto the platform, we also plan to provide actionable insights and the ability to automate remediation if the customer chooses to do so. 
Marketing and Sales
We market and sell our products directly to technology professionals with a primarily low-touch, high-velocity digital marketing and “selling from the inside” motion that we believe is unique and hard to replicate in the software industry. Our marketing efforts and selling motion allow us to effectively capture demand and maintain high levels of sales productivity at low customer acquisition costs. 
We target our marketing efforts and selling motion directly at network, systems, DevOps and SecOps professionals within organizations. We believe this approach provides us with a significant advantage in today’s environment in which purchasing influence and power largely resides with the technology professionals themselves.
Marketing
We have built a highly flexible and analytics-driven direct marketing model designed to efficiently drive website traffic and high-quality leads that are typically trials of full-featured products from our websites. By providing trials of full-featured products, we enable prospective customers to easily explore the capabilities of our products and easily transition from trial to sale. We also have a marketing motion directed at current customers designed to educate them about features of products they own, products they do not own and how to trial new products.
We make broad use of digital marketing tools including search engines, targeted email campaigns, localized websites, virtual events, free IT management tools, display advertising, affiliate marketing, account-based marketing, social media, e-book distribution, video content, blogging and webcasts.
We also engage using our online community, THWACK. Within THWACK, we provide forums, solutions, tools, webcasts, content and other valuable resources relevant to the IT management market. This community is designed to train and inform technology professionals about our products, keep us connected to them and provide network effects to amplify word-of-mouth marketing for our products.
Sales
We refer to our traditional selling motion as “selling from the inside.” This approach is rooted in having our sales organization physically located in our offices, selling online or over the phone, using a prescriptive approach to managing leads and adhering to standardized pricing and contract terms. We close transactions of all sizes and locations through our selling from the inside approach. 
Our sales organization is divided into our dedicated sales team and our retention and maintenance renewal team. Our dedicated sales team focuses exclusively on sales of new products to new and existing customers. Our dedicated sales team receives high-quality leads from our marketing motion and engages with the prospect to close the sale. We adhere to a 
disciplined, data-driven approach to converting leads quickly and efficiently based on our understanding of the prospect’s specific product demands and the inflection points in the selling process. We augment this high-velocity motion with a targeted, high-touch Enterprise sales team and Customer Success motion that is designed to elevate and drive higher-level strategic conversations and opportunities within targeted customer accounts. 
Our retention and maintenance renewal team focuses exclusively on renewing our subscription and maintenance agreements with our customers. Our conversations with these customers begin months before the renewal date to support our customers, and we work with them through the renewal process.
We also sell our software through a variety of partners, including distributors, resellers, global systems integrators and cloud service providers, to supplement and complement our direct sales force, expand our global presence, reach various market segments and help us to initiate and fulfill sales orders from state, local and federal governments and those commercial customers that prefer to make purchases through a partner. We contract directly with end customers when we sell our products through channel partners. We have a number of partners who are proactively creating demand for our products and bring new opportunities and customers to us. 
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is primarily responsible for the design, development, testing and deployment of new products and improvements to existing products, with a focus on ensuring that our products integrate with and complement one another. As we evolve from monitoring to observability, we are increasing our focus on integrated and hybrid solutions for multi-cloud deployments. We also continue to invest research and development efforts in connection with our "Secure by Design" framework.
In our software development process, we work closely with our user community throughout the development process to build what is needed for the problems technology professionals face every day. This includes regularly having a subset of our customers participate in validating that our product use cases and features will solve their problems.
Over more than a decade, we have honed our approach to building a development organization that allows us to build products and enhance existing products quickly and efficiently. Our global development model allows us to source from a large pool of talented resources by participating in multiple labor markets to match the best person to each role. We utilize small scrum teams, each dedicated to specific product modules that follow a standard set of practices to build and test their code continuously. We share our development values across our offices and aim to assign meaningful design and development work to our international locations. 
We believe that we have developed a differentiated process that allows us to release new software rapidly, efficiently and with a high level of quality.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry that is characterized by constant change and innovation. Changes in networks, applications, devices, operating systems and deployment environments result in continuously evolving customer requirements. Our competitors and potential competitors include:
•network management and IT vendors such as Cisco Systems, Micro Focus, Broadcom, IBM and BMC Software; and
•companies in the cloud and application performance monitoring market, including Datadog, Dynatrace and New Relic.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market are:
•brand awareness and reputation among technology professionals, including IT professionals, DevOps professionals and SecOps professionals;
•product capabilities, including scalability, performance, security and reliability;
•ability to solve problems for companies of all sizes and infrastructure complexities;
•ease of use;
•low total cost of ownership;
•flexible deployment models, including on-premises, in the cloud or in a hybrid environment;
•strength of sales and marketing efforts; and
•focus on customer success.
We believe that we compete effectively across these factors as our products and marketing efforts have been designed with these criteria as guideposts.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade dress and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection. As of December 31, 2021, we owned approximately 34 issued U.S. patents and 201 issued foreign patents, with expiration dates ranging from December 2026 to March 2038. We have also filed approximately 57 currently pending patent applications, but we cannot guarantee that patents will be issued with respect to our current patent applications in a manner that gives us the protection that we seek or at all. Our patents and any future patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and may not provide sufficiently broad protection or may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers.
We endeavor to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and with parties with which we do business in order to limit access to and disclosure of, and safeguard our ownership of, our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use or reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours or that infringe our intellectual property, and policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights can be difficult. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on any legal actions against these infringers being successful, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.
Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available or where we have operations. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2021, we had 2,147 employees fully dedicated to our business, of which 884 were employed in the United States and 1,263 were employed outside of the United States. We strive to be a people-first company and believe we have a positive relationship with our employees, which we continue to nurture and develop. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreement. In certain of the European countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements in relation to the establishment of works councils and/or industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We are often required to consult and seek the consent or advice of these works’ councils.
Our success is the result of our talented, experienced, and high performing employees across our organization, including functions such as research and development, sales and marketing, partner success and general and administrative.
As a global company, we have the distinct advantage of employing talented and diverse individuals across different ethnicities, genders, races, religions, sexual orientations, and generations, all supported by a culture of appreciation, innovation, learning and inclusion. Our CARE values (collaboration, accountability, ready and empathy) enable us to build lasting relationships with our communities around the world. We continue to invest heavily in attracting top talent, training and development initiatives and motivating and retaining high potential employees.
Total Rewards
Our total rewards philosophy encompasses a comprehensive, equitable, and market-competitive employee offerings that are essential to attracting and retaining diverse talent. Our appreciation, rewards and benefit programs apply to all of our local and global employee populations. Our wellness programs are carefully crafted to offer physical, mental/emotional, and financial support to our employees and their families. We regularly review our programs and encourage employee feedback about what they value most. In addition to specifically tailored packages for each country based on local market practice and the competitive landscape, we also provide a range of globally available support programs such as an employee assistance program, online health engagement and child development support. 
People Culture and Experience 
Our culture and experience philosophy starts with what we call "Solarian Life & Communities", which encompasses our communities of interest (COI), intersections with our growth team, and a strong focus on internal communications. Our COIs span inclusion and belonging, wellness, sustainability, and giving and are all managed by a group of volunteer employees that we call "Culture Connectors". Managed and enabled by our culture and experience team, these Culture Connectors run live events, asynchronous activities and challenges, and open-forum roundtable discussions to ensure all employees are energized and engaged by our culture. Central to this is a rich, transparent, and omni-channel communications strategy that bridges the gap between executives and individual contributors, keeps employees informed on important company developments, and provides centralized places to connect and share with other employees.
Growth 
Our growth philosophy is driven by the desire for our employees to constantly learn, continuously improve, and eternally evolve. We invest significant resources to actively foster a learning culture throughout the company and to empower our employees to drive their personal and professional growth by equipping them with various learning programs, as well as extensive onboarding and training programs. Our learning programs are available for our employees at all levels of career progression and include e-learning programs, live classes, diversity, and inclusion training, mentoring communities, customized learning workshops, management enablement and skills training for current, new and future managers, and employee wellness programs. We believe that by empowering our employees as they strive to grow personally and professionally, we will be able to build a flexible and resilient workforce and maintain and nurture a robust pipeline of talent to fuel our future growth and strategy.
