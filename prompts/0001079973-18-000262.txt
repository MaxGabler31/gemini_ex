History
 
      China Biotech Holdings Limited (formerly Agate Island Acquisition Corporation and China Biotech Company Corporation) ("China Biotech," the "Company" or the "Registrant") was incorporated on April 4, 2016 under the laws of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. The current business purpose of the Company is to seek the acquisition of, or merger with, an existing company.
 
On March 13, 2017, the Company changed its name to China Biotech Holdings Limited. The Company changed its name in anticipation of entering into a transaction with a company in China engaged in the Biopharma or Biotech industry. To date the Company had not entered into an agreement with a China based company, although it anticipates that it will do so during the 2018 fiscal year. Further, management is considering acquiring or entering into an agreement with a company affiliated with the Company's President and controlling shareholder that has been formed to primarily focus on the health benefits associated with the Acer Truncatum tree that is native to China. Seed oil from the tree contains 6% nervonic acid, which has been shown to promote resistance to Alzheimer's disease and mental degradation associated with aging, and to assist with cerebrovascular patient treatment and recovery.
 
On May 3, 2017, the Company effected a change of its control.  The Company cancelled an aggregate of 19,500,000 shares of the then 20,000,000 shares of outstanding stock valued at par.  James M. Cassidy resigned as the Company's president, secretary and director and James McKillop resigned as the Company's vice president and director.  CHANG Ting Ting was then named sole director of the Company and was named President, Secretary and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. On May 4, 2017, the Company issued 8,000,000 shares of its Common Stock to Ting Ting Chang for no consideration as a result of the change in control.
 
The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have been limited to issuing shares to its original shareholders, filing a registration statement under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act") and effecting the change in control under which CHANG Ting Ting became the Company's controlling shareholder and sole director. The Company was formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act.
 
The Company registered its Common Stock on a Form 10 registration statement filed pursuant to the Exchange Act and Rule 12(g) thereof.  The Company files with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") periodic and current reports under Rule 13(a) of the Exchange Act, including quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K.
 
The Company has no employees, two officers, one director and three shareholders.
 
On November 15, 2017, our Board of Directors unanimously adopted resolutions approving the redomicile of the Company from Delaware to the Cayman Islands. The Company will be redomiciled by merging the Company into its wholly-owned Cayman Islands subsidiary (the "Redomicile Merger"). We have obtained all necessary corporate approvals for the Redomicile Merger, and the Company anticipates that the Redomicile Merger will be completed in April 2018. A Definitive Information Statement on Schedule 14C outlining the terms and conditions of the Redomicile Merger was filed with the SEC on January 16, 2018 (the "Information Statement") under the Exchange Act.

Redomicile Merger
 
The following summary highlights selected information from the Information Statement. To better understand the Redomicile Merger and other transactions contemplated thereby, you should carefully read the entire Information Statement and the exhibits attached thereto.
 
The Parties to the Merger Agreement and the Plan of Merger
 
China Biotech Holdings Limited.  The Company is a "shell company" with no current operations and only nominal assets and liabilities.
 
Zhong Yuan Bio-Technology Holdings Limited.  Zhong Yuan Bio-Technology Holdings Limited ("Zhong Yuan") was formed in July 2016 as an exempted company limited by shares under the laws of the Cayman Islands and is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. An "exempted" company under the laws of the Cayman Islands is one which receives such registration as a result of satisfying the Registrar of Companies in the Cayman Islands that it conducts its operations mainly outside of the Cayman Islands and is, as a result, exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Law (2016 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, such as the general requirement to file an annual return of its shareholders with the Registrar of Companies, and is permitted flexibility in certain matters, such as the ability to register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman Islands. Zhong Yuan does not have a significant amount of assets or liabilities and has not engaged in any business since its incorporation other than activities associated with its anticipated participation in the Redomicile Merger.
 
The principal executive offices of each of the Company and Zhong Yuan are located at Suite 2432, Sun Hung Kai Centre, 30 Harbour Road, Wanchai, Hong Kong; Telephone: +852 29198916; Facsimile: +852 25747287.
 
Background and Reasons for the Redomicile Merger
 
We believe that the Redomicile Merger, which would change our place of incorporation from Delaware to the Cayman Islands, (i) would allow us to reduce operational, administrative, legal and accounting costs over the long term because Zhong Yuan is expected to qualify as a foreign private issuer and be exempt from certain rules under the Exchange Act, which is in line with the Company's expectation that, subsequent to a merger with an operating company, the Company's business and operations will be conducted primarily outside of the United States, and (ii) will more closely align our structure with our international corporate strategy. Because we anticipate that, subsequent to our merger with an operating company, substantially all of our executive team and members of our Board of Directors will likely reside outside the United States, we believe that it is advisable to move our place of incorporation outside the United States.
 
The Merger Agreement
 
A copy of the Merger Agreement, including the Plan of Merger, is attached to the Information Statement. The Company encourages you to read the entire Merger Agreement and Plan of Merger carefully, as they are the principal documents governing the Redomicile Merger.
Zhong Yuan Ordinary Shares
 
When the Redomicile Merger is completed, each share of the Company's Common Stock shall convert into the right to receive one ordinary share in the capital of Zhong Yuan, which ordinary shares will be issued by Zhong Yuan in connection with the Redomicile Merger. Following the Redomicile Merger, the former stockholders of the Company will become holders of Zhong Yuan ordinary shares, and Zhong Yuan will own and continue to conduct our business in substantially the same manner as is currently being conducted by the Company. In light of the fact that the Company has only three stockholders, the ordinary shares will be issued to the stockholders of the Company in reliance on exemptions from registration provided by Regulation S with respect to CHANG Ting Ting, and Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") with respect to all three shareholders. The share certificates issued by Zhong Yuan will each contain a restrictive legend, and all shares issued will constitute restricted securities.

Treatment of the Company's Options, Warrants and Convertible Securities
 
In connection with the Redomicile Merger, each outstanding option, warrant or convertible security exercisable or convertible into Common Stock of the Company will be assumed by Zhong Yuan and will become an option, warrant or convertible security exercisable or convertible into an equal number of ordinary shares in the capital of Zhong Yuan under the same terms and conditions.
Board of Directors; Management of Zhong Yuan Following the Redomicile Merger
 
Following the Redomicile Merger, Zhong Yuan will be managed by the same Board of Directors and executive officers that manage the Company.
 
Accounting Treatment
 
The Redomicile Merger will be accounted for as a legal reorganization with no change in ultimate ownership interest immediately before and after the transaction. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities will be recorded at historical cost as an exchange between entities under common control.
Business
 
The Company is currently considered to be a "blank check" company. The SEC defines those companies as "any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Exchange Act, and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies." Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, the Company also qualifies as a "shell company," because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations.  Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of "blank check" companies in their respective jurisdictions. There is no trading market in the Company's Common Stock, and there can be no assurance that a trading market of any significance will develop or that there will be any depth to any such market that may develop. Management does not intend to undertake any significant efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities until we have successfully concluded a business combination, and filed a Registration Statement under the Securities Act with the SEC. The Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act under Section 13(a).
  
We are investigating acquiring a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company's principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. Management is considering acquiring or entering into an agreement with a company affiliated with the Company's President and controlling shareholder that has been formed to primarily focus on the health benefits associated with the Acer Truncatum tree that is native to China.  A final decision with respect to whether to acquire the target company associated with the Company's President and controlling shareholder is expected to be made within the next sixty days.

The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our management. As of this date, the Company has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party regarding business opportunities for the Company. The Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, the Company will consider the following kinds of factors:
 
 
(a) | Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products;
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(e) | The cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials;
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(f) | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------


(g) | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(h) | Other relevant factors.
----+------------------------



In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the Company's limited capital available for investigation, the Company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. There are numerous "public shell" companies either actively or passively seeking operating businesses with which to merge in addition to a large number of "blank check" companies formed and capitalized specifically to acquire operating businesses. Additionally, we are subject to competition from other companies looking to expand their operations through the acquisition of a target business. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than the Company and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business.
 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities with a business objective similar to ours to acquire a target business on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. Many of our target business' competitors are likely to be significantly larger and have far greater financial and other resources than our target. Some of these competitors may be divisions or subsidiaries of large, diversified companies that have access to financial resources of their respective parent companies. Our target business may not be able to compete effectively with these companies or maintain them as customers while competing with them on other projects. In addition, it is likely that our target business will face significant competition from smaller companies that have specialized capabilities in similar areas. We cannot accurately predict how our target business' competitive position may be affected by changing economic conditions, customer requirements or technical developments. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources to compete effectively.

Form of Acquisition
 
The manner in which the Company participates in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters.
 
It is likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of Common Stock or other securities of the Company. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called "tax free" reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other "tax free" provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. Under other circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 20% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who were stockholders of the Company prior to such reorganization.
 
The present stockholders of the Company will likely not have control of a majority of the voting securities of the Company following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, all or a majority of the Company's directors may resign, and one or more new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders.
 
In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or approval by stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving the Company, it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders' meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding securities. The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval.  However, due to the share ownership of management, even if stockholder approval is required, management will also control the shareholder vote.
 
It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the Company of the related costs incurred.
 
We presently have no employees apart from our management. Our management is engaged in outside business activities and anticipates that they will devote very limited time to our business until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination.
