Overview 
 Vicor Corporation designs, develops, manufactures, and markets modular power components and power systems for converting, regulating, and controlling electric current. We consider power components analogous to building blocks, and our strategy is based largely on products, performing distinct functions, that can be flexibly 
 
1 


  combined to enable a complete power system. We serve customers with applications for which the high conversion efficiency (i.e., the ratio of output power in watts to the power consumed by the component) and high power density (i.e., the amount of output power in watts divided by the volume of the component) of our products are well suited. We also offer a range of higher value-added standard products (our Configurable product line) and custom system design and manufacturing capabilities. Both our Configurable products and custom systems leverage the superior performance of our modular power components. 
 In the market segments we serve, we position the Company as a vendor of power components that can be utilized individually, given their market-leading performance, or combined, given their level of integration, to create highly-differentiated power management solutions. We articulate this positioning through our Power Component Design Methodology, which is our approach to providing our customers the modular products, design tools, and engineering support to enable the rapid design of comprehensive power conversion and management systems. 
 Our website, www.vicorpower.com, sets forth detailed information describing our Power Component Design Methodology, all of our products, the applications for which they may be used, and our suite of design tools. The information contained on our website is not a part of, nor incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K and shall not be deemed filed under the Exchange Act. 
 We are headquartered in Andover, Massachusetts, where our manufacturing facility is located. We conduct business primarily through the activities of our three reporting segments, the Brick Business Unit (BBU), established in 2005, and our two operating subsidiaries, Picor Corporation, established in 2001, and VI Chip Corporation, established in 2007. Picor Corporation relocated its headquarters from North Smithfield, Rhode Island, to Lincoln, Rhode Island in January 2017. Picor Corporation also has personnel based in Andover, Massachusetts. VI Chip Corporation is headquartered in Andover, Massachusetts, where its manufacturing facilities are co-located with those of the BBU. 
 Our Vicor Custom PowerTM locations are geographically distributed across the United States, and all are incorporated in Delaware. In March 2016, we acquired 100% ownership of certain operating assets and cash of our consolidated subsidiary, Converpower Corporation, in which we held a 49% ownership interest. In December 2015, we completed the statutory merger of one Vicor Custom Power subsidiary, Mission Power Solutions, Inc., with and into another subsidiary, Northwest Power, Inc., after which we closed the Mission Power Solutions location. Also in December 2015, we sold our 49% ownership interest in Aegis Power Systems, Inc. to Aegis Power Systems, thereby ending our formal relationship with this now-former subsidiary. The consolidated financial statements presented herein reflect these transactions. 
 Internationally, we conduct business through subsidiaries incorporated in or branch offices established in individual countries. Vicor Japan Company, Ltd. (VJCL), our 92.5%-owned Japanese subsidiary, which is engaged in sales and customer support activities exclusively for the sale of certain products customized by VJCL for the Japanese market, is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. Vicor B.V., a wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in the Netherlands, provides logistical and administrative support for a limited volume of orders placed directly with the Company by customers in the European Union. We have established individual subsidiaries or branch offices outside of the United States, Technical Support Centers (TSCs), to conduct preparatory and auxiliary services in support of the Company. 
 VLT, Inc., incorporated in California, is our wholly-owned licensing subsidiary. VICR Securities Corporation, incorporated in Massachusetts, is a subsidiary established to hold certain investment securities. 
 Our subsidiaries and their legal domicile are set forth in Exhibit 21.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The activities of all of the above named entities are consolidated in the financial statements presented herein.

 We were incorporated in Delaware in 1981. Shares of our Common Stock were listed on the NASDAQ National Market System in April 1990 under the ticker symbol VICR, and we completed an initial public offering of our shares in May 1991. 
 Market Background and Our Strategy 
 In electrically-powered devices utilizing alternating current (AC) voltage from a primary AC source (for example, a wall outlet), a power system converts AC voltage into the stable direct current (DC) voltage necessary to power subsystems and/or individual applications and devices (known as loads). In many electronic devices, this DC voltage may be further converted to one or more higher or lower voltages required by a range of loads. In equipment utilizing DC voltage from a primary DC source (for example, a battery), the initial DC voltage similarly may require further conversion to one or more voltages. Because numerous applications requiring different DC voltages and varied currents may exist within an electronic device, and system power architectures themselves vary, we offer an extensive range of products and accessories in numerous application-specific configurations. We believe our product offering is among the most comprehensive in the market segments we serve. 
 Since the Company was founded, our product strategy has been driven by innovations in design, largely enabled by our focus on the development of differentiated technologies, often implemented in proprietary semiconductor circuitry. Many of our products incorporate patented or proprietary implementations of high-frequency switching topologies, which enable the design of converter modules much smaller and more efficient than conventional alternatives. Emphasizing the superior power density and performance advantages of this technology, our primary product strategy since our founding has been to offer a comprehensive range of component-level building blocks to configure a power system specific to a customers needs. 
 Our strategy, competitive positioning, and product offerings, all based on highly differentiated product performance, have anticipated the evolution of system power architectures. As system designs advanced, along with the demands of the loads powered, the inherent limitations of historically accepted system power architectures have caused designers to seek out improved solutions. 
 In 1984, we introduced a significant enhancement of the standardized DC-DC converter: the fully-encapsulated brick module. Our innovative, patented technology utilized our implementation of zero current soft switching topology to deliver unprecedentedly high switching frequencies and, in turn, unprecedented power density. Superior conversion efficiency, overall performance improvements, and full encapsulation (which provided shielding from environmental influences) contributed to significant enhancement of thermal performance characteristics, an important competitive advantage. Such thermal performance enhancement has been critical to the differentiation of our power converters, as the by-product of voltage conversion is heat, which must be dissipated in order to assure the performance of the converter itself and the overall system to which it is delivering power. 
 The brick module integrated transformation, regulation, isolation, filtering, and/or input protection into a single device, thereby driving the adoption of the Distributed Power Architecture (DPA). The dominant system power architecture up until that time, the Centralized Power Architecture (CPA), generates all system voltages centrally and distributes these voltages to loads using individual distribution buses (i.e., a conductive circuit, generally made of copper). CPA became expensive and impractical for electronic systems increasingly characterized by widely distributed and diverse loads requiring lower voltages, higher currents, and faster responsiveness to rapidly changing power demands of varied loads. DPA, enabled by the brick concept, allows the distribution of one DC voltage system-wide and downstream conversion of that voltage, with a brick, at a specific load. This approach allows electricity to be distributed through a complex system in the most efficient manner, at a uniform higher voltage (typically 48 volts), thereby dramatically reducing distribution and conversion losses, lowering copper consumption, and significantly increasing design flexibility. With patented

  advances in switching topology and converter design, Vicor became a leading vendor of brick DC-DC converters in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly within the telecommunications infrastructure segment of the market. 
 With the advent of enterprise computing in the 1990s, the limitations of DPA became apparent, as the number of different loads on a system board increased beyond the level for which DPA and bricks were well-suited. The Intermediate Bus Architecture (IBA), a multi-stage extension of DPA, addressed the space constraints, performance requirements, and cost challenges of highly complex system boards by further separating the functions of DC conversion carried out by the brick, which in IBA is replaced by an isolated bus converter delivering a stepped-down (i.e., reduced), unregulated voltage to a non-isolated point-of-load regulator. For computing and, later, networking applications, IBA was more scalable and cost-efficient, as numerous brick DC-DC converters on a system board were replaced by one brick DC-DC converter, providing one system-wide distributed voltage, accompanied by numerous, lower-cost bus converters providing an intermediate bus voltage, typically from 5 to 14 volts, to point-of-load regulators. 
 Two significant industry changes coincided with the broad adoption of IBA in the late 1990s and the early 2000s. The first change was the significant decline of the telecommunications infrastructure segment that represented our primary focus, while the second change was a pronounced shift toward product commoditization, primarily driven by globalization. These two changes had an interrelated impact on our strategy, as the primary driver of IBA adoption was initial cost reduction, not system conversion efficiency. As such, IBA was broadly implemented using 12 volt distribution, not the more efficient 48 volt distribution, our core competency. 
 Unwilling to pursue rapidly commoditized market opportunities, notably in IBA, and unwilling to relocate our manufacturing to lower-cost countries, we shifted our strategy and operations in the 2000s to emphasize mass customization, using highly automated, efficient, domestic manufacturing to serve customers with product design and performance requirements, across a wide range of worldwide market segments, that could not be met by high-volume oriented competitors. We focused on applications, largely implementations of DPA, for which our brick DC-DC legacy products were well-suited, in market segments such as aerospace and defense electronics, industrial automation, industrial equipment, instrumentation and test equipment, and transportation (e.g., rail). This strategy has been the basis upon which the BBU has competed since this strategic and operational shift. The customers served range from independent manufacturers of highly specialized electronic devices to larger original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their contract manufacturers. 
 During the 2000s, we embarked on a long-term strategy based on our belief that our competitors products and existing system power architectures, notably IBA, would not meet evolving market requirements, notably system conversion efficiency. Over the last decade, we have invested significantly in the development of new power component technologies and product concepts addressing two meaningful market trends, the first toward higher required conversion efficiencies, and the second toward more and diverse on-board voltages, higher current requirements, and the higher performance demands of numerous complex loads. Reflecting the versatile, building block approach of our Power Component Design Methodology, in 2003 we introduced our Factorized Power ArchitectureTM (FPA), an innovative, component-based approach to flexible, rapid system design, based on separate components optimized to perform a specific function. FPA increases system conversion efficiency, density, and power delivery by dedicating regulation and transformation functions into separate power modules. This re-partitioning of power conversion enables higher input voltages, 48V as an example, to be converted directly to the point of load reducing the number of conversion stages required (i.e., duplicated functions requiring separate components), reducing system distribution losses, and reducing power dissipation at the point-of-load. We continue to believe FPA represents a compelling architectural alternative to other architectural implementations, as it offers superior conversion efficiency, higher power density, improved system responsiveness, and an attractive total cost of ownership, while offering advantageous system design and board layout flexibility. 
 To support implementation of FPA, we introduced our initial range of advanced products, our VI Chip modules exploiting our proprietary expertise in soft switching topologies and control, power semiconductors, 
 
4 


  materials, and packaging: the PRM® (Pre-Regulator Module), a non-isolated buck-boost regulator; the BCM® (Bus Converter Module), an isolated, fixed ratio intermediate bus voltage converter; and the VTM® (Voltage Transformation Module), an isolated current multiplier (i.e., voltage converter). The VTM and BCM utilize on our Sine Amplitude ConverterTM switching topology, a patented fixed-frequency implementation of zero current / zero voltage soft switching, while the PRM is based on our proprietary implementation of zero voltage soft switching (ZVS), which is optimized for buck-boost voltage regulation. All three products incorporate technologies for which we have been issued patents or have patent applications pending. 
 Beginning in 2011, with an expanded portfolio of advanced products from our VI Chip and Picor subsidiaries, we began to focus our strategic efforts toward higher-volume opportunities with global OEMs and the Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) and contract manufacturers serving these OEMs, as FPA and our advanced products offered superior power density, conversion efficiency, and thermal management characteristics for board-based, rack-mounted point-of-load applications, notably for microprocessors requiring tightly regulated, high currents. FPA and our first-generation VI Chip modules were adopted by customers for use in demanding applications, most notably supercomputing, sophisticated test instrumentation, and defense electronics. However, broader adoption was inhibited by cost considerations and, to a lesser extent, our initially limited product range. 
 In response, we undertook development of a substantially improved product platform, which we introduced in 2013. Our ChiP platform (ChiP is an acronym for Converter housed in PackageTM) specifically was designed to be a scalable product format, with lower manufacturing costs, which could be leveraged to efficiently and quickly broaden product offerings. ChiPs are offered in the same functional families as the earlier VI Chip modules, using the same advanced switching topologies, but, because of the formats improved manufacturability and design leveragability, we are able to offer much broader ranges of performance specifications within existing and new functional families. Because ChiPs were designed to be manufactured in volume with lower costs, we are able to profitably sell ChiPs and ChiP-based solutions at competitive prices, on a cents-per-watt basis, comparable to prices of alternative commodity products. While our first-generation VI Chip modules were designed to facilitate FPA implementations, ChiP modules support all known power distribution architectures, including FPA, thereby expanding our addressable market opportunity (i.e., the range of customer applications across which our advanced products can be used). 
 At the same time, we developed a high-performance family of point-of-load regulators, in System in Package (SiP) format, to be integrated into our expanding product portfolio, truly enabling comprehensive power management solutions to point(s)-of-load. These ZVS point-of-load regulators have been designed to meet the requirements of high-volume customers for differentiated performance and cost effectiveness. 
 In 2014, we introduced the VIA packaging concept (VIA is an acronym for Vicor Integrated AdaptorTM), a rugged, double-sided package for ChiP modules integrating complementary components and circuitry, offering superior thermal management characteristics. The VIA package provides customers an advanced, turn-key solution for their demanding power needs, cost-effectively accelerating design cycles and time-to-market, while providing superior power density. The VIA package is particularly differentiated for certain applications with challenging form factor and thermal management requirements, such as those often associated with defense electronics. We consider the VIA package to be strategically important, as it has been designed to be used in the widest range of power system architectures and applications, allowing us to target applications ranging from those addressed by our legacy brick products to the most challenging emerging applications. 
 In 2015, we introduced a family of non-isolated, fixed conversion ratio, bi-directional, bus converter modules (the NBM family). Highly differentiated NBMs exploit our latest innovations in magnetics and semiconductors, enabling improved efficiency and power density, and represent, we believe, a competitively important element of our Power Component Design Methodology, complementing other advanced products to expand the range of board-level applications served by our integrated solutions. 
 
5 


 In 2017, we introduced a surface mount variant of the ChiP platform, the SM-ChiP, which provides added thermal management and design flexibility in addition to the same performance benefits as the through-hole ChiP platform upon which it is based. The addition of surface mounting both expands the range of applications for which our ChiP products may be used, and affords our customers faster development and lower manufacturing costs, given the absence of mounting pins. The Modular Current Multiplier DriverTM (MCD) and Modular Current MultiplierTM (MCM), both based on the SM-ChiP platform, are the two modules making up our Power-on-PackageTM solution, which we believe will be a source of revenue growth for the Company. Additionally, in 2017, the Company introduced other surface mount derivatives of the ChiP platform, including a surface mount extension of the NBM family. 
 Since the introduction of our advanced products, we have been executing a transitional go-to-market strategy based on our Power Component Design Methodology, exploiting our historical strengths, while addressing both the realities of todays power conversion marketplace and our vision of its long-term direction. This strategy involves maintaining a profitable legacy business in bricks and brick-based system solutions, while investing in and transitioning our focus to an advanced product portfolio based largely on the ChiP platform, targeting higher growth opportunities. 
 Today, we target customer applications for which the high conversion efficiency and high power density of our products are well suited within the following commercial and military market segments: aerospace and aviation; defense electronics; enterprise and high performance computing (including large scale datacenters and supercomputers); industrial automation; industrial equipment; instrumentation and test equipment; medical diagnostics; telecommunications and network equipment and infrastructure; transportation infrastructure, and vehicles (including autonomous driving and electric and hybrid electric vehicles). With our advanced products, we also are pursuing opportunities in emerging market segments, including commercial solid state lighting and 380 volt DC-based facility infrastructure (also referred to as micro-grids). 
 Our competitive positioning has been, and will continue to be, supported by our long-standing commitment to research and development of power conversion technologies, advanced packaging and manufacturing, and innovative approaches to solving customer problems. We incurred approximately $44,924,000, $41,848,000, and $41,472,000 in research and development expenses in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, representing approximately 19.7%, 20.9%, and 18.8% of revenues in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. 
 As stated, our strategy involves maintaining high levels of customer engagement and design and engineering support, which has resulted in significant expansion of our sales and application engineering infrastructure over historical levels, notably in high growth regions of the world such as China, Korea, and India. We incurred approximately $40,438,000, $37,967,000, and $37,336,000 in marketing and sales expenses in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, representing approximately 17.7%, 19.0%, and 17.0% of revenues in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. 
 We intend to maintain spending in support of research and development and marketing and sales at levels, on an absolute basis, consistent with prior periods. If we successfully execute our strategy, we believe our revenue should increase and, if so, the percentages of revenue represented by spending on research and development and marketing and sales should decline in comparison to historical percentage levels. 
 Competition 
 Despite significant consolidation of our competitors in the markets we serve with legacy products, the growth of large-scale, low-cost foreign competitors in the commoditized segments of those markets, and increased application overlap with vendors of solutions based on semiconductors and discrete components in the markets we serve with advanced products, the total global merchant market for AC-DC and DC-DC power conversion solutions remains fragmented, with over 1,000 merchant (i.e., non-captive) vendors. The markets we 
 
6 


  serve, among which some overlap exists for our legacy and advanced products, are made up of many large, diversified manufacturers, as well as many smaller manufacturers focused on specialized products or narrowly defined market segments or geographies. The markets we serve with legacy products, typically through sales representatives and distribution partners, are generally characterized by relatively long (i.e., greater than three years) product life cycles, offset by increasing commoditization and price competition. The markets we serve with advanced products, typically on a direct basis, are generally characterized by relatively short (i.e., less than three years) product life cycles, and competitors that are primarily far larger vendors of integrated circuits and discrete components competing on price. 
 Although numerous third party industry studies estimate the total global merchant market for AC-DC and DC-DC switching power supplies to exceed $20 billion of annual revenue, representing approximately two-thirds of the total annual consumption of switching power supplies (i.e., the sum of merchant and captive volumes consumed), the Company competes in smaller, well-defined commercial and military market segments and niches within those segments. We believe, based on these third party estimates, AC-DC power supplies represent more than 85% of the total merchant market, reflecting a wide range of battery charging applications, primarily in the consumer, mobile device, and office computing segments (commodity segments in which we currently do not compete, together representing more than 50% of the total merchant market). Based on our own assessment of the segments in which we do compete, we estimate our aggregate addressable market opportunity within the AC-DC portion of the merchant market approaches $1 billion annually, while we estimate our aggregate addressable market opportunity within the DC-DC portion of the merchant market exceeds $3 billion annually. These third party industry studies set forth estimates of varying levels of annual, dollar-based, nominal revenue growth across the merchant market segments in which we compete. These studies indicate most of the market segments we serve with legacy products have experienced low single-digit growth over the past three years. These studies further indicate most of the market segments we serve with advanced products have experienced high single-digit and low double-digit growth over the past three years. 
 Despite our minor share in the overall merchant market and the competitive presence of numerous, far larger vendors in the market segments and niches we serve with both legacy and advanced products, we believe we maintain an advantageous competitive position in those market segments and niches. Notably, we believe we have the largest share of the 48 Volt to point-of-load niches within the served segments of the enterprise and high performance computing market. However, numerous competitors across these market segments and niches have significantly greater engineering, financial, manufacturing, and marketing and sales resources, as well as longer operating histories and longer customer relationships, than we do. 
 The competitive characteristics of market segments we serve with our transitional go-to-market strategy may vary. Generally, competition is based on product price, product performance, design flexibility (i.e., ease of use), and product availability. We seek to position ourselves with customers across all market segments served in a manner that reduces our vulnerability to commoditization. With our legacy products, we emphasize our highly differentiated responsiveness to individual customer requirements, enabled by our mass customization capabilities, broad range of solution offerings, and relatively high level of customer engagement. As we shift our strategy, increasing our focus on higher volume, OEM and ODM opportunities, we are emphasizing what we believe are our sustainable competitive advantages going forward: the differentiation of our advanced products superior performance and power densities, enabled by our patented and proprietary technologies; a compelling value proposition based on lower total cost of ownership enabled by superior power conversion efficiencies; and the advantageous design flexibility enabled by our advanced products and our Power Component Design Methodology. 
 Our Products 
 Reflecting our Power Component Design Methodology, we offer a comprehensive range of individual, highly-integrated, building blocks enabling design of a power system specific to a customers precise needs. Since introducing and popularizing the encapsulated brick package format during the 1980s, our product focus 
 
7 


  has been on high performance DC-DC switching converters providing the transformation, regulation, isolation, filtering, and/or input protection necessary to power and protect sophisticated electronic loads. With our development of FPA, significant enhancement of our manufacturing capabilities, and the introduction of an expanding range of advanced products, we believe we offer the most advanced range of high-performance power components in the industry. A secondary and highly complementary product strategy has been to vertically integrate our component-level building blocks into complete power systems representing turnkey AC-DC and DC-DC solutions for our customers power needs. 
 Reflecting our history and direction, we broadly categorize our products as either legacy or advanced, generally based on design, performance, and form factor considerations, as well as the range of applications for which the products are appropriate. 
 Legacy Products 
 The following product groups include those that have historically generated the majority of our revenue, and are manufactured by our BBU reporting segment. Some of our brick product lines have been in production for over a decade, reflecting the long-established relationships we have with many customers and the long-standing suitability of our products to demanding applications. Their generally long lifecycles and well-established share of targeted market segments provide the competitive foundation and organizational resources for our transitional go-to-market strategy. 
 

 | Bricks (Modular DC-DC Converters, IBCs, and Complementary Components)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 We offer brick modules as DC-DC converters, as well as complementary components providing AC line rectification, input filtering, power factor correction, and transient protection. These products are well-established as important, reliable elements of conventional power systems architectures. 
 We currently offer seven families of high power density, component-level DC-DC converters, representing what we believe to be the broadest selection of encapsulated DC-DC converter modules in the industry: the VI-200TM, VI-J00TM, MI-200TM, MI-J00TM, and the FasTrakTM module line, our highest volume products, made up of the Maxi, Mini, and Micro product families. All of our DC-DC converters are based on our proprietary approach to resonant soft switching, enabling high efficiencies and power densities. Wide ranges of input voltages, output voltages, and output power are offered, allowing end users to select components appropriate to their individual applications. The products differ in dimensions, temperature grades, maximum power ratings, performance characteristics, pin configuration, and, in certain cases, characteristics specific to the targeted market. 
 We also offer a line of open-frame (i.e., not encapsulated) intermediate bus converters (IBCs) for implementation of multi-stage power conversion. IBCs utilize the same Sine Amplitude Converter switching topology utilized in many of our advanced products. These low profile, isolated, fixed-ratio bus converters conform to industry standard quarter-brick and eighth-brick pin-compatible dimensions, but offer performance superior to competitive offerings. 
 Products from our broad line of complementary components are used to condition and/or filter the input and output voltages of the brick DC-DC converter. Generally, these components address customer requirements at the AC current source, upstream from our DC-DC converters, providing rectification of the AC current, input filtering, inrush limiting, and transient protection. We also offer numerous accessories to meet customer requirements. 
 These legacy products generally are targeted at applications requiring high performance and reliability in the following market segments: aerospace and aviation; defense electronics; industrial automation; industrial equipment; instrumentation and test equipment; medical diagnostics; telecommunications infrastructure; transportation infrastructure, and vehicles. 
 

 | High Density ZVS DC-DC Converters
--+----------------------------------

 We offer a family of isolated DC-DC converters delivering up to 60 watts in a small (22 x 16.5 x 6.7 mm) surface-mount package. These converters utilize our proprietary ZVS topology to achieve high-switching

8 


  frequencies enabling best-in-class power density, while reducing input and output filtering requirements. Because these small devices are packaged in an over-molded package, they are able to withstand harsh environments in applications for which space is limited and light weight is advantageous (e.g., aerospace, aviation, and defense electronics). These high density converter modules are offered in three input voltages: 48 volt nominal for communication applications; 28 volt nominal for rugged high temperature or military applications; and 24 volt nominal for industrial applications. 
 

 | Configurable Products
--+----------------------

 Utilizing our modular brick components to provide system function, we offer numerous higher valued-added standard AC-DC and DC-DC products we configure to a customers specific needs, often with multiple voltage outputs. These near-custom products exploit the benefits and flexibility of our modular approach to offer higher performance, higher power densities, lower costs, and faster delivery than many competitive offerings. Our configurable products typically are used in a range of CPA and distributed power architecture implementations in defense electronics, industrial and transportation applications, as well as medical instrumentation. 
 

 | Custom Power Systems
--+---------------------

 Certain customers rely on us to design, develop, and manufacture custom power systems to meet performance and/or form factor requirements that cannot be met with standard products. These low-volume, high value-add system solutions frequently are designed to function reliably in the harsh environments associated with aerospace, aviation, and defense applications, but also are used in applications ranging from industrial equipment to medical instrumentation. Historically, we have utilized products from our legacy product portfolio in our custom power systems. However, during 2017, all new custom designs utilized products from our advanced product portfolio, thereby extending the advantages of our advanced products to the turnkey solutions offered by the Vicor Custom Power organization. 
 Annual revenue associated with the sale of legacy products represented approximately 66.4%, 75.5%, and 78.5% of the Companys consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. 
 Advanced Products 
 The following advanced product groups reflect our vision of the direction of the market segments we serve with our Power Component Design Methodology. These products have been designed by our VI Chip and Picor reporting segments, with VI Chip modules manufactured by the BBU, and Picor modules manufactured by third parties. Many of these products are targeted toward FPA implementations, but our more recently introduced advanced products are suitable for other distributed architectures. 

 | ChiPs (Modular Power Components)
--+---------------------------------

 Introduced in 2013, the ChiP platform has been designed to be a scalable product format, with lower manufacturing costs, which could be leveraged to efficiently and quickly broaden product offerings. We believe the ChiP platform establishes best-in-class standards for a new generation of scalable power modules, while expanding our capability range and, in turn, our addressable market opportunity. Combining advanced, proprietary magnetic structures, power semiconductors, and microcontrollers in a high density interconnect substrate, the ChiP platform delivers superior thermal management characteristics, allowing customers to achieve low cost power system solutions with previously unattainable system efficiency, size, and weight. ChiP modules also have lower manufacturing costs than our original VI Chips, thereby allowing us to offer highly differentiated products, not only with superior total cost of ownership over time, but at attractive initial price points. Our goal is to offer ChiP modules and solutions on a cents per watt basis near or equivalent to the prices of competitive product offerings, thereby presenting customers with a compelling value proposition. 
 
9 


 ChiPs are produced in the same functional families as our earlier VI Chip FPA modules (i.e., PRM, BCM, and VTM), but today we offer over 100 specific ChiP module variants, reflecting a broad range of configurations based on dimensions, lead formats, and performance specifications, enabled by the flexible module format. As highlighted above, we have introduced, beginning in 2015, products in the NBM family of non-isolated, fixed conversion ratio, bi-directional, bus converter modules. Highly differentiated NBMs exploit our latest innovations in magnetics and semiconductors. Based on our current design and development activities, we anticipate further expansion of the range of package sizes, board or chassis mounting alternatives, lead formats, and performance characteristics of our ChiP product offerings, notably within the SM-ChiP line of surface mount modules. We plan to target a number of these new product families and variants at segments and applications that, if successfully penetrated, should expand the size and range of our addressable markets. 
 ChiP modules are targeted at applications, regardless of the power distribution architecture, for which their high level of performance and form factor differentiation is appropriate. Across distributed power system architectures, at the sophisticated applications for which ChiPs are appropriate include: aerospace and aviation (e.g., for use in unmanned aerial vehicles, due to their conversion efficiency, reliability, small form factor, and light weight); computing (e.g., for source to point-of-load solutions in servers deployed in datacenters, due to their conversion efficiency and flexibility of use, which contribute to lower total cost of ownership); defense electronics (e.g., for use in airborne, seaborne, or field radar, due to their high power capabilities, conversion efficiency, ruggedness, and reliability); industrial automation, instrumentation, and test equipment (e.g., for use in semiconductor testing, due to their power density and tight current regulation); telecommunications and networking infrastructure (e.g., for use in pole-mounted small-cell base stations in urban environments, due to their form factor, reliability, and cost/performance profile); and vehicles (e.g., in autonomous driving applications, electric vehicles, and hybrid electric vehicles, due to their form factor, light weight, differentiated performance, and cost/performance profile). As stated, we also are pursuing applications in market segments and niches for which the advantages of ChiPs are most compelling (e.g., solid state signage, for which high performance, small form factor and design flexibility are required). 
 

 | VIAs (Vicor Integrated Adapter Package)
--+----------------------------------------

 The VIA platform is a rugged, double-sided, copper-alloy package for ChiP modules, integrating complementary components, circuitry, and superior thermal management through conductive cooling. In 2016, we completed installation of our first dedicated manufacturing line exclusively for the VIA packaging concept. We consider the VIA platform to be important to our transitional go-to-market strategy, as it has been designed to enable the use of ChiP modules across the widest range of power system architectures, power levels, and applications. It is an easy-to-use power management solution, providing customers an advanced, turn-key solution for their demanding power needs, cost-effectively accelerating design cycles and time-to-market, while providing superior power density. The VIA platform is particularly differentiated by the flexibility it provides designers, as it offers substantial thermal advantages and its form factor allows a broad range of installation options. In numerous applications, the package simplifies thermal design considerations and, in some instances, eliminates the need for a fan for convection cooling, improving overall system reliability and further minimizing the power system footprint. 
 The VIA platform also facilitates the VIA DCM, which is an important product for executing our strategic transition. We currently offer seven variants of the VIA DCM. The product family integrates filtering, output voltage regulation, circuitry protection, and a control interface, giving the VIA DCM the function of a conventional brick DC-DC converter, while offering higher conversion efficiency, superior power density, and the design flexibility described above. As such, we are positioning the VIA DCM as a successor to our legacy brick DC-DC converters, notably in advanced, challenging applications, such as those associated with defense electronics.

 | System-in-Package Point-of-Load Regulators (Cool-Power® SiP ZVS Modules)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our Cool-Power brand of non-isolated, point-of-load regulators consists of an expanding portfolio of buck (i.e., the device steps down voltage) and buck-boost (i.e., the device lowers or increases voltage) regulators, all in surface mount packaging. 
 We believe Cool-Power buck regulators provide best in class conversion efficiency (up to 98%), allowing customers to deploy more efficient designs, regardless of power system architecture, based on the compatibility of these point-of-load regulators with voltages of 12, 24, or 48 volts. These regulators, based on our patented and proprietary technologies, have been optimized for loads requiring high conversion efficiency, power density, and precise regulation, such as computer and graphic processors and specialized ASICs. 
 Our success to date with these products has frequently been when they have been part of an integrated FPA solution, delivering a tightly regulated voltage to an upstream VTM serving as a current multiplier, delivering low voltage, high, precisely regulated current to the point-of-load. Our 48 volt to point-of-load solutions for datacenter servers is representative of such an integrated FPA solution. 
 

 | Front-End (AC  DC) Solutions
--+------------------------------

 During 2017, we expanded the range and capabilities of our solutions for the conversion of alternating currents to direct currents, enhancing our positioning as a supplier of highly-differentiated power management solutions from the AC source to the point(s) of load. Such solutions include our ChiP PFM® (Power Factor Module) and the VIA PFM. Representing a significant improvement over our legacy front-end solutions, the VIA PFM achieves a market-leading power density, supplying from a universal AC input an isolated DC output , with active power factor correction at 93% peak conversion efficiency, which is an unmatched level for an AC-DC converter of this size and power density. We pair the VIA PFM with our VIA AIMTM (AC Input Module), which provides AC rectification, filtering, transient protection, and inrush limiting capabilities, thereby creating a high-performance AC-DC front-end solution of differentiated small size. This solution has been well-received in market segments for which it is especially well-suited, including small-cell base stations and commercial solid state lighting and signage. 
 During the second half of 2017, we recognized revenue associated with the shipment of significant prototype volumes of our latest front-end innovation, a three-phase front-end module (the RFM TM), which provides superior conversion efficiency and unmatched power density. We anticipate formally introducing the new RFM product line during the first quarter of 2018, with specific RFM products to be announced throughout 2018. We expect the RFM will become a meaningful element of our Power Component Design Methodology, as it represents a highly differentiated solution for enabling fully integrated power conversion and management in the most demanding applications, such as high performance computing and supercomputing. 
 

 | VI Chips (Modular Power Components)
--+------------------------------------

 We continue to offer the first generation of VI Chip PRM, BCM, and VTM modules, in full (32.5 by 22.0 by 6.73 mm) and half (22.0 by 16.5 by 6.73 mm) sizes, targeting FPA implementations. These products remain compelling solutions for certain applications, notably in defense electronics, medical instrumentation, and test and measurement applications. 
 With the expansion of ChiP product families, we anticipate our sales of the first generation of VI Chips may be limited primarily to shipments to existing customers during the life cycles of the applications into which these products have been designed. However, we expect the life cycles of many of these applications may continue for several years. 
 During 2017, the Company discontinued the production and sale of many power path management components, originally developed by our Picor subsidiary, having determined the volumes sold of these 
 
11 


  circuit protection products no longer represented a compelling complement to the adoption and sale of our other advanced products. The revenues and profits associated with the sale of such components were not material to the Companys consolidated results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. 
 Annual revenue associated with the sale of advanced products, including the power path components referenced immediately above, represented approximately 33.1%, 24.2%, and 21.1% of the Companys consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. 
 Patents and Intellectual Property 
 An important element of our strategy is to protect our competitive leadership with domestic and foreign patents and patent applications that cover our products and much of their enabling technologies. We believe our competitive leadership is further protected by proprietary trade secrets associated with our use of certain components and materials of our own design, as well as our significant experience with manufacturing, packaging, and testing these complex devices. 
 We believe our patents afford advantages by building fundamental and multilayered barriers to competitive encroachment upon key features and performance benefits of our principal product families. Our patents cover the fundamental switching topologies used to achieve the performance attributes of our converter product lines; converter array architectures; product packaging design; product construction; high frequency magnetic structures; and automated equipment and methods for circuit and product assembly. 
 As of December 31, 2017, in the United States, we have been issued 98 total patents. These patents have expirations scheduled between 2018 and 2035. We also have a number of patent applications pending in the United States and certain countries of Europe and Asia, including applications that would extend the life of current patents. We have vigorously protected our rights under these patents and will continue to do so. Although we believe patents are an effective way of protecting our technology, there can be no assurances our patents will prove to be enforceable in any given jurisdiction. 
 In addition to generating revenue from product sales, we seek to license our intellectual property. In granting licenses, we generally retain the right to use our patented technologies and manufacture and sell our products in all licensed geographic areas and fields of use. Licenses are granted and administered through our wholly-owned subsidiary, VLT, Inc., which is the assignee for our patents that may be subject to licensing. Revenues from licensing arrangements have not exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenues in any of the last three fiscal years. 
 Customers and Backlog 
 The applications in which our products are used are in the higher-performance, higher-power segments of the market segments we serve. With our legacy product lines, we serve customers concentrated in aerospace and aviation, defense electronics, industrial automation, industrial equipment, medical diagnostics, rail transportation, and test and measurement instrumentation. With our advanced product lines, we serve customers concentrated in the datacenter and supercomputer segments of the computing market, although we also target applications in aerospace and aviation, defense electronics, networking equipment, solid state lighting and signage, test and measurement instrumentation, and vehicles (notably in the autonomous driving, electric vehicle, and hybrid vehicle niches of the vehicle segment). With our strategic emphasis on larger, high-volume customers, we expect to experience a greater concentration of sales among relatively fewer customers. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, NuPower Electronic, Ltd., our authorized distributor for China, accounted for approximately 13.0%, 16.4%, and 16.2% of net revenues, respectively, and our five largest customers represented approximately 35.2%, 26.5%, and 33.4% of net revenues, respectively. 
 
12 


 International revenues, as a percentage of total revenues, were approximately 63.2%, 59.8%, and 60.0% in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Net revenues from customers in China, our largest international market, accounted for approximately 35.8% of total net revenues in 2017, approximately 32.1% in 2016, and approximately 34.2% in 2015, respectively. International sales have increased from historical levels primarily due to higher volumes of shipments to foreign ODMs and contract manufacturers, many of which are located in China, utilized by domestic and international OEMs. As we have substantially expanded our sales and customer support activities and resources internationally, particularly in Asia, we expect international sales to continue to increase as a percentage of total revenue. (See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our reporting segments). 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had a backlog of approximately $73,054,000, compared to $48,371,000 as of December 31, 2016. Backlog, as presented here, consists of orders for products for which shipment is scheduled within the following 12 months, subject to normal customer cancellation policies. A portion of our revenue in any quarter is, and will continue to be, derived from orders booked and shipped in the same quarter. Over the past two years, the portion of sales booked and shipped in the same quarter has represented less than one third of our quarterly revenue, as we typically only build products to customer specifications upon receipt and acceptance of a purchase order (i.e., we typically do not maintain significant inventories of finished goods of either legacy or advanced products). 
 The lead times between receipt and acceptance of an order and our shipment of the product continued to lengthen during 2017, reflecting overall conditions across the global electronics supply chain. As of December 31, 2017, we were quoting average lead times to customers of 14 weeks, up from averages, as of December 31, 2016, of four weeks for legacy products and eight weeks for advanced products. We do not expect current supply chain uncertainties to be resolved in the foreseeable future, allowing us to uniformly reduce lead times. Accordingly, we continue to build inventory levels for certain components and raw materials to offset the risks of supply chain uncertainties that might impact our ability to meet customer scheduling requirements. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We reach and serve customers through several channels: a direct sales force; a network of independent sales representative organizations in North America and South America; independent, authorized non-stocking distributors in Europe and Asia; and three authorized stocking distributors world-wide, Digi-Key Corporation, Future Electronics Incorporated, and Mouser Electronics, Inc. These channels are supported by regional TSCs, each offering application engineering and sales support for our channel partners. Domestic TSCs are located in: Andover, Massachusetts; Lombard, Illinois; and Santa Clara, California. International TSCs are located in: Beijing, China; Hong Kong, China; Shanghai, China; Shenzhen, China; Munich, Germany; Bangalore, India; Milan, Italy; Tokyo, Japan; Seoul, South Korea; Taipei, Taiwan (Republic of China); and Camberley, United Kingdom. Customers do not place purchase orders with TSCs, but do so directly with the Company or with our distributors. In Japan, customers place purchase orders with VJCL or authorized distributors. 
 Because of the technically complex nature of our products and the applications they address, we maintain an extensive staff of Field Applications Engineers to support our own sales and customer support activities, as well as those of our channel partners. Field Application Engineers, based in our TSCs, provide direct technical support worldwide by reviewing new applications and technical matters with our channel partners in support of existing and potential customers. Product Line Engineers, located in our Andover headquarters, support Field Application Engineers assigned to all of our TSCs. 
 Vicor also reaches customers through the electronic commerce capabilities of our website, www.vicorpower.com. Registered, qualified customers in the United States, Canada, and certain European countries are able to purchase selected products online. We intend to expand these capabilities to allow for higher-volume purchases.
 Our web-based resources are an important element of our efforts to interact with and support customers. Within our website, PowerBenchTM is a workspace of tools and references allowing engineers to 
 
13 


  select, architect, and implement power systems using Vicors products. During 2017, we continued to enhance our highly differentiated WhiteboardTM tool, which allows users to configure and analyze their own power system designs or those from an extensive library of designs addressing a wide range of applications. Users can modify the operating condition for each component of their design to match the intended application and perform efficiency and loss analysis of individual components and the full power system. We are aggressively expanding the range and capabilities of engineering tools we make available online to customers and prospective customers. 
 We generally sell our products on the basis of our standard terms and conditions, and we most commonly warrant our products for a period of two years. Effective January 1, 2017, we extended the warranty period to three years for a range of H Grade, M Grade, and MI Family DC-DC products sold after that date. In a limited number of circumstances, we have entered into supply contracts with certain high-volume customers calling for extended warranty terms. With our distribution partners, we also enter into contracts providing for our product warranties to transfer to the end customer upon final sale of our product(s) by the distributor. 
 Manufacturing, Quality Assurance, and Supply Chain Management 
 Our manufacturing facilities are located in Andover, Massachusetts, where we are headquartered. Products designed and sourced by our Picor subsidiary, given its fabless model, are manufactured, packaged, and tested by third party contractors in the United States and Asia. 
 Our primary manufacturing processes consist of assembly of electronic components onto printed circuit boards; automatic testing of components; wave, reflow and infrared soldering of assembled components; encapsulation or over-molding of converter subassemblies and assemblies; final environmental stress screening of certain products; and product inspection and testing using automated equipment. These processes are largely automated, but their labor components require relatively high levels of skill and training. 
 We continue to make investments in automated manufacturing equipment, particularly for our ChiP modules. Based on current estimates of legacy and advanced product manufacturing volumes and our capacity requirements, we do not expect to incur capital expenditures during 2018 significantly higher than we incurred during recent years. However, we have stated publicly our intent to significantly expand our production capabilities through the construction of a new manufacturing facility, dedicated to the ChiP platform. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we concluded our original plan, to construct a facility of approximately 75,000 to 100,000 square feet, starting in 2018, would not be functional in time to meet our short-term requirements or of sufficient scale to meet our longer-term forecast of capacity requirements. As such, we revised our expansion plan at that time, focusing on construction of a larger facility, roughly equal to our current square footage, to meet longer-term forecast capacity requirements. We do not yet have a targeted date for breaking ground on this larger facility, but we anticipate doing so by early 2019. 
 As stated above, we introduced the SM-ChiP in 2017. This surface mount variant of the ChiP platform requires a number of process steps not included in the manufacture of a through-hole ChiP module. To date, we have relied on several third party contractors to perform such steps in relatively low volumes, thereby limiting our ability to scale production and appropriately control quality and costs. In December 2017, we entered into a production agreement with a highly sophisticated contractor capable of delivering the short term volumes expected, while meeting our quality and cost requirements. We anticipate the agreement will enable us to meet our forecast needs for SM-ChiP production until our planned manufacturing facility is fully functional. 
 We pursue a manufacturing strategy based upon production flexibility and the continuous improvement of product quality, volume throughput, and reduced manufacturing costs. Product quality and reliability are critical to our success and, as such, we emphasize quality and reliability in our design and manufacturing activities. We follow industry best practices in manufacturing and are compliant with ISO 9001 certification standards (as set forth by the International Organization for Standardization). Our quality assurance practices include rigorous testing and, as necessary, burn-in and temperature cycling (i.e., extended operation of a product to confirm 
 
14 


  performance) of our products using automated equipment. Incoming components, assemblies, and other parts are subjected to several levels of inspection procedures, and we maintain robust data on our raw material inventories in order to support our quality assurance procedures. 
 Components and materials used in our products are purchased from a variety of domestic and international vendors. The global electronics supply chain has been slowed due to capacity constraints, among other influences, and the lead times for delivery of many of the raw materials required for the manufacture of our products substantially lengthened during 2017. Most of these raw materials are available from multiple sources, whether directly from suppliers or indirectly through distributors, and during 2017 we opportunistically expanded certain raw material inventories to offset the uncertainties associated with lengthening lead times. 
 Our Picor subsidiary, given its fabless model, relies on a limited number of wafer foundries and providers of packaging and test services. Our proprietary switching controllers were designed by and are sourced through Picor, which relies on these wafer foundries and service providers for supply continuity and sufficiency of these critical semiconductor devices. Similarly, many of the proprietary semiconductors we use, for which we have either a manufacturing license or ownership of the designs, are sourced from third parties through Picor. 
 See Note 16  Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements for certain financial information associated with the operations and manufacturing activities of our business segments. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 970 full time employees and 10 part time employees. The number of part time employees varies throughout any year, largely based on the number of production shifts we may require at a particular time, as well as the number of college and graduate students participating in short term co-op programs. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Although there is strong demand for qualified personnel, we have not to date experienced meaningful difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient engineering and technical personnel to meet our needs (see Part I, Item 1A  Risk Factors).
