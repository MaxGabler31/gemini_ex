ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 NextGen Healthcare is a leading provider of ambulatory-focused healthcare software and services solutions. In pursuit of our mission to empower the transformation of ambulatory care, we provide innovative technology-based solutions that help our clients succeed while they are managing more complexity and assuming greater financial risk. 
 Our clients span the ambulatory care market from small single specialty practices to larger multi-specialty organizations. We have fully integrated our solutions so that our clients are able to provide their patients with comprehensive services utilizing a single platform. Our highly interoperable platform allows ambulatory practices to thrive especially in complex, heterogeneous healthcare communities where frictionless clinical data exchange is required to coordinate and optimize patient care.   
 NextGen Healthcare has historically enhanced our solutions through both organic and inorganic activities. In October 2015, we divested our former Hospital Solutions division to focus exclusively on the ambulatory marketplace. In January 2016, we acquired HealthFusion Holdings, Inc. and its cloud-based electronic health record and practice management solution. In April 2017, we acquired Entrada, Inc. and its cloud-based, mobile platform for clinical documentation and collaboration. In August 2017, we acquired EagleDream Health, Inc. and its cloud-based population health analytics solution. In January 2018, we acquired Inforth Technologies for its specialty-focused clinical content. The integration of these acquired technologies have made NextGen Healthcare’s solutions among the most comprehensive and powerful in the market.  
 The Company was incorporated in California in 1974. Previously named Quality Systems, Inc., the Company changed its corporate name to NextGen Healthcare, Inc. in September 2018. Our principal offices are located at 18111 Von Karman Ave., Suite 800, Irvine, California, 92612, and our principal website is www.nextgen.com. We operate on a fiscal year ending on March 31.
 Industry Background and Market Opportunity
 Over the last decade, the ambulatory healthcare market has experienced significant regulatory change, which has driven practice transformation and technology advancements. Recognizing that it was imperative to digitize the American health system to stem the escalating cost of healthcare and improve the quality of care being delivered, Congress enacted the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act in 2009 (“HITECH Act”). The legislation stimulated healthcare organizations to not only adopt electronic health records, but to use them to collect discrete data that could be used to drive quality care. This standardization supported early pay for reporting and pay-for-performance programs. 
 In 2010, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) established the roadmap for shifting American healthcare from volume (fee-for-service) to a value-based care (“VBC”) system that rewards improved outcomes at lower costs (fee-for-value). This was followed by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”), bipartisan legislation that further changed the way Medicare rewards clinicians for value vs. volume. Initially focused on government-funded care, the domain of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), these programs are now firmly established on the commercial insurance side of the industry as well.
 VBC created the need for a new category of healthcare information technology (“HIT”) tools that could be used to identify and treat groups of patients, or cohorts, based on risk.  Population Health Management (“PHM”) tools support these needs by identifying patient risk, engaging patients, coordinating care, and determining when interventions are needed to improve clinical and financial outcomes. The United States PHM market was estimated at $3.1 billion in 2018 and is expected to more than double by 2022. 
 Importantly, the introduction of VBC programs was only an element of the broader approach to reducing healthcare expenditure. It was also accompanied by significant reductions in Medicare spending with a projected reduction of $218 billion in payments by 2028, as reported by RevCycle Intelligence. The drive to reduce costs initially led to consolidation in the healthcare system that was followed by a significant shift of care from the inpatient to the outpatient setting as more care is being moved to this lower cost environment. Ambulatory care settings have become an essential component of comprehensive, low cost distributed care. In 2018, outpatient volumes reached over 3.5 billion encounters and are forecasted to grow 15% by 2028, as reported by Becker’s Health IT and CIO Report. The independent physicians’ practices segment is expected to generate more revenue than non-affiliated hospitals as it accepts electronic health records integrated PHM programs for better primary and follow-up care, as reported by Frost & Sullivan. The need to sustain revenue has made it extremely important for practices to secure their patient market share, elevating patient loyalty to be a significant determinant of provider success. Capturing patient market share and thriving in a market driven by VBC requires both an integrated platform and a full view of the patient population’s clinical and cost data neither of which could be accomplished without new technologies to collect and analyze multi-sourced patient data. Effectively implemented, these new technologies allow organizations to enhance financial viability while exercising the freedom to join, affiliate, integrate or interoperate in ways that maximize strategic control.
 In order to maintain financial success with shifting reimbursement rules and shrinking reimbursement, we believe demand for managed services, including revenue cycle management services (“RCMS”), hosting, transcription and scribe services, aligned and integrated with clinical technology solutions, will increase in the coming years.

Based on these trends, successful clients must undertake the following imperatives: 1) ensure healthy predictable financial outcomes, 2) provide high quality care at a lower cost in a risk-bearing environment, 3) ensure engaged and loyal patients, and 4) optimize clinician productivity while deploying HIT solutions, 5) support frictionless interoperability.     
 Our Strategy
 Our core strategy is to become a trusted partner to our clients as they embark on their value-based journey and begin to take on risk as part of value-based contracts. We understand that our clients are now faced with a more complex, rapidly changing practice environment and that the HIT solutions that support these endeavors must evolve to meet these challenging requirements. Providing our clients with a comprehensive multi-faceted platform and accompanying services to enable their success is the key to our strategy.
 Based on current market trends, our strategic priorities are:
  
• | Focus on Ambulatory Care. We create for and invest in the specific needs of ambulatory care providers, giving us a distinct competitive advantage in our target market over solution providers who focus on hospitals first. While many of our competitors spread their R&D and localization investment across global regions, NextGen Healthcare maintains an exclusive focus on U.S.-only ambulatory practices.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide an integrated ambulatory care platform with superb scalability, flexibility and interoperability. Many healthcare challenges are uniquely local or regional -- our platform and capabilities flex and scale to fit our clients’ practices and workflows, not the other way around. Our ability to interoperate is pervasive, allowing our clients to exchange data seamlessly.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enable groups to successfully take on risk. We provide our clients with cloud-based population health tools that consume multi-sourced agnostic data, including adjudicated claims and risk stratification, care management tools, cost and utilization reporting, as well as quality measurement and reporting tools. Population health insights are delivered in core clinical and financial workflows enabling care givers to better engage their patients.

Our Solutions 
 NextGen Healthcare software and services based solutions map to our clients’ strategic imperatives (refer to top row in the image below). The foundation for our integrated ambulatory care platform (blue boxes) is a core of our industry-leading electronic health records (“EHR”) and practice management (“PM”) systems that support clinical and financial activities. These can be deployed on premise or in the cloud. Our primary cloud infrastructure provider is Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). We optimize the core with an automation and workflow layer that gives our clients control over how platform capabilities are implemented to drive their desired outcomes. The workflow layer includes mobile capabilities proven to reduce physician burden. Our cloud-based population health and analytics engine allows our clients to improve results in both fee-for-service and fee-for-value environments. In support of extensibility, we surround the core with open, web-based APIs to drive the secure exchange of health and patient data with connected health solutions. Finally, our technology is augmented with services as required and is mapped to client imperatives.   
Clinical Care Solutions improve the quality and efficiency of care delivery. They significantly ease the administrative burden and enable the delivery of high quality, personalized care. Providers can automate patient intake, streamline clinical workflows, and leverage vendor-agnostic interoperability to achieve quality measures and qualify for incentives. 
 Financial Management Solutions drive healthy, predictable financial outcomes. More than just billing and collections, financial management involves all functions that effectively capture revenue at the lowest cost. Financial management solutions help practices improve performance, correct operational inefficiencies, while enhancing the practice’s financial outcomes throughout the revenue cycle. 
 Patient Engagement Solutions boost loyalty and improve outcomes by engaging patients in their care. Our integrated patient engagement solutions empower patients to manage their own health through direct patient-provider messaging, online scheduling, automated reminders, easy payment options, and virtual visits. The ability of patients to handle their own scheduling and billing frees provider staff from tedious tasks, restoring valuable time. 
 Population Health Solutions provide a single source of truth by aggregating disparate data, including vendor-agnostic clinical data with paid claims data. Sophisticated analytics are applied to this data to generate insights that enable practices to improve the quality of care, identify high risk patients who require enriched services, and coordinate the care of patients with chronic conditions. Cost and utilization analytics allow practices to successfully participate in risk-bearing contracts by providing timely insights into areas of over-utilization, under-utilization and mis-utilization of health care resources.
 Connected Health Solutions provide frictionless interoperability. Interoperability is the ability of different information technology systems to communicate and exchange usable data. In healthcare, it enables caregivers to more effectively work together within and across organizational boundaries. To provide the highest quality care at the lowest cost, organizations need to capture and share information both within and outside of their networks. Our integrated, interoperable solutions and services enable providers to leverage their current technology for better outcomes and truly connected patient care.

 We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products and services. To protect our proprietary rights, we enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees with whom such controls are relevant. In addition, we include intellectual property protective provisions in our client contracts. However, because the software industry is characterized by rapid technological change, we believe such factors as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, name recognition, and reliable product maintenance are more important to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position than the various legal protections of our technology.
 We rely on software that we license from third parties for certain components of our products and services. These components enhance our products and services and help meet evolving client needs. The failure to license any necessary technology, or to maintain our existing licenses, could result in reduced functionality of or reduced demand for our products.
 Although we believe our products and services, and other proprietary rights, do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the future. Any such claims may result in costly, time-consuming litigation and may require us to enter into royalty or cross-license arrangements.
 Competition
 The markets for healthcare information systems and services are intensely competitive and highly fragmented. Our traditional full-suite competitors in the healthcare information systems and services market include: Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., athenahealth, Inc., Cerner Corporation, eClinicalWorks, Epic Systems Corporation, and Greenway Health, LLC.  Emerging smaller competitors also bring competition in specific sectors of the market. Additionally, we face competition from services-only competitors like business process outsourcers, hosting providers and transcription companies. 
 The EHR, PM, interoperability, and connectivity markets, in particular, are subject to rapid changes in technology. We expect that competition in these market segments could increase as new competitors enter the market. We believe our principal competitive advantages are our ambulatory-only focus, our comprehensive and fully-integrated solution, and our deep domain expertise, which enables our subject matter experts to serve as trusted advisors to our clients.
 Research and Development
 The healthcare information systems and services industry is characterized by rapid technological change, requiring us to engage in continuing investments in our research and development to update, enhance and improve our systems. This includes expansion of our software and service offerings that support pay-for-performance initiatives around accountable care organizations, bringing greater ease of use and intuitiveness to our software products, enhancing our managed cloud and hosting services to lower our clients' total cost of ownership, expanding our interoperability and enterprise analytics capabilities, and furthering development and enhancements of our portfolio of specialty-focused templates within our electronic health records software.

Sales and Marketing
 We sell and market our products primarily through a direct sales force and to a lesser extent, through a reseller channel. Software license sales to resellers represented less than 10% of total revenue for each of the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
 NextGen Healthcare also provides solutions to networks of practices such as managed service organizations (MSOs), independent physician associations (IPAs), accountable care organizations (ACOs), ambulatory care centers (ACCs), and community health centers (CHCs).
 Our direct sales force is comprised of subject matter experts by solution, as well as engaged account managers, all of whom deliver presentations to potential clients by demonstrating our systems and capabilities on the prospective client’s premises. System demonstrations for mobile workflow and analytics solutions are more web-based as these offerings tend to be targeted to larger practices. Sales efforts aimed at smaller practices can be performed on the prospective clients’ premises, or remotely via telephone or web-based presentations. Both the direct and reseller channel salesforces concentrate on multi-product/solution sales opportunities.
 Our sales and marketing employees identify prospective clients through a variety of means, including: a healthcare data and analytics platform, search engine optimization of content on nextgen.com; digital advertising; direct mail and email campaigns; referrals from existing clients and industry consultants; contacts at professional society meetings and trade shows; webinars; trade journal advertising; public relations and social media campaigns; and telemarketing. Resources have shifted more heavily to digital marketing as we meet potential clients where they are and how they shop for services. Additionally, we focus on thought leadership and content marketing to highlight our industry knowledge, expertise and the successes of our diverse client base.
 Our sales cycle can vary significantly and typically ranges from six to twenty-four months from initial contact to contract execution. Software licenses are normally delivered to a client almost immediately upon receipt of an order and we normally receive up-front licensing fees. Implementation and training services are normally rendered based on a mutually agreed upon timetable. Clients have the option to purchase hosting and maintenance services which, if purchased, are invoiced on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. Subscriptions generally involve implementation and are typically billed monthly after implementation or based on volume or throughput.
 We continue to concentrate our direct sales and marketing efforts on the ambulatory market from large multi-specialty organizations to small-single specialty practices in high-opportunity specialty segments.
 We have numerous clients and do not believe that the loss of any single client would adversely affect us. No client accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue during each of the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Substantially all of our clients are located in the United States.
 Employees
 As of March 31, 2019, we had approximately 2,660 full-time employees, of which 533 were based in Bangalore, India and substantially all other employees were based in the United States. We believe that our future success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining qualified sales, marketing and technical talent as well as other employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union.
