ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Ontrak, Inc. (“Ontrak,” “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 29, 2003. Ontrak was founded with a passion for engaging with and helping improve the health and save the lives of anyone impacted by behavioral health conditions. We are an AI-powered and telehealth-enabled, virtualized healthcare company, whose mission is to help improve the health and save the lives of as many people as possible. Our technology-enabled platform provides claim-based analytics and predictive modeling to provide analytic insights throughout the delivery of our personalized treatment program. Our program predicts people whose chronic disease will improve with behavior change, recommends effective care pathways that people are willing to follow, and engages and guides them to and through the care they need. By combining predictive analytics with human engagement, we deliver improved member health and validated outcomes and savings to healthcare payors.
Our integrated, technology-enabled OntrakTM programs are designed to provide healthcare solutions to members with behavioral conditions that cause or exacerbate chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and congestive heart failure, which result in high medical costs. Ontrak has a unique ability to engage these members, who do not otherwise seek behavioral healthcare, leveraging proprietary enrollment capabilities built on deep insights into the drivers of care avoidance. Ontrak integrates evidence-based psychosocial and medical interventions delivered either in-person or via telehealth, along with care coaches who address the social and environmental determinants of health, including loneliness. Our programs seek to improve member health and deliver validated cost savings to healthcare payors.
We operate as one segment in the United States and we have contracted with leading national and regional health plans to make the Ontrak program available to eligible members. 
Our Market
The true impact of behavioral health is often under-identified by organizations that provide healthcare benefits. Individuals with unaddressed behavioral health conditions that worsen chronic medical comorbidities cost health plans and employers a disproportionate amount of the total healthcare costs. A recent analysis in Milliman's research report titled "How do individuals with behavioral health conditions contribute to physical and total healthcare spending?" dated August 13, 2020 (the "Milliman research report") found that for the high-cost behavioral health population, who typically have multiple chronic medical comorbidities, insignificant amounts are spent on needed behavioral healthcare. This unaddressed situation not only negatively impacts the lives of these members, but also significantly contributes to avoidable spending. As unmanaged chronic conditions worsen over time, avoidable emergency department and inpatient costs are incurred. As such, engaging this population not only offers health plans a much greater cost savings opportunity compared to lower acuity populations, but also the opportunity to improve the lives and outcomes of their most vulnerable members. 
A smaller, high-cost subset of these patients with behavioral health conditions drives the majority of the claims costs for the overall substance dependent population. According to the Milliman research report, the behavioral subgroup patients constituted 5.7% of the total commercial population of insured lives but accounted for 44% of total commercial healthcare costs. 
Furthermore, adults with anxiety, addiction and/or depressive disorders increased by 300% since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The National Institute of Mental Health reports that nearly one in five adults in the United States of America are impacted by behavioral health issues, such as substance abuse, anxiety disorders or depression. Mental Health America, a large community-based nonprofit dedicated to addressing and promoting mental health, reports that approximately 24% of adults with behavioral health disorders were not able to receive the treatment they needed and that this number has not declined since 2011. Approximately 90% of Ontrak eligible members had untreated or under-treated behavioral health disorders. When considering behavioral health-related costs, many organizations have historically only looked at direct treatment costs–usually behavioral claims. For the members we seek to engage in our solution, costs associated with behavioral health treatment represent a small portion of their overall healthcare claims, while the medical costs are significant as most patients with behavioral health conditions do not receive the appropriate treatment they need for other existing medical conditions.
Our Solution
Our business strategy is to deliver proven, repeatable clinical and financial outcomes to health plans for their members with unaddressed behavioral conditions that worsen other medical comorbidities. We do this by identifying, engaging and treating these members through our technology enabled program that focuses on the intersection between behavioral health, physical health and social health. Our advanced AI-supported intervention platform will provide enhanced identification, engagement, digital indicators and treatment processes to improve the overall program efficacy and visibility, which provides greater flexibility to tailor treatment for a more personalized and effective behavior treatment to address the needs of our members throughout their care journey. 
 The Company’s identification process includes the ability to customize outreach based on prediction of case complexity, readiness to engage, highest cost to health plans, inappropriate use of hospitalization and gaps in care. The engagement process will enable Ontrak to predict probability of contact based on the member’s preferences, optimal matching of members and coaches, and optimal matching of members and providers. Additionally, digital care indicators will highlight to care coaches when a member is at risk and new mobile experiences will trigger a signal for encouragement when a member is likely to disengage. Treatment will be enhanced by natural language processing of care coach notes and provider visit transcripts, so that these can be rapidly shared between care coaches and providers for valuable engagement signals and real time action throughout the member’s journey. Ontrak’s activation process is enhanced through 6- and 12-month behavioral health check-ins after graduation to feed the algorithms, inform training, and continuously improve program efficacy. By using end to end AI services across every member’s behavioral health journey, Ontrak can provide payers and providers with better coordinated and easier to measure care.
We believe that in addition to virtual care, a human touch is necessary to keep members engaged in line with their goals. A successful program must take a whole-person approach, individualized to each member, and help members overcome barriers to care and empower them to create durable behavior change. Our unique approach to engage complex, unmanaged populations identifies these members and addresses the various barriers to care that may be impacting them through our proven four-step approach.
Identify
We specifically focus on members with anxiety, depression and/or substance use disorder(s) by using AI and predictive modeling, applying claims-based analytics to identify health plan members with medical costs that may be impacted through behavioral health treatment with the Ontrak program. We uncover deep, predictive attributes, leveraging advanced data analytics using variety of different features relating to co-occurring medical conditions to identify individuals with unaddressed behavioral health conditions, even absent a diagnosis, that cause or exacerbate chronic medical disease. These members may or may not be diagnosed with a behavioral condition. 
With the combination of our AI driven identification of potential members and person-centered outreach methodology, on average, we have successfully enrolled 25% of eligible and identified members into the Ontrak program. 
Engage
With behavioral health concerns on the rise, and with social detriments and access barriers continuing to impact how and when these individuals seek care, it has never been more important to engage members who need help. Health plans struggle to effectively engage high-cost members with unaddressed behavioral health issues and chronic disease. Ontrak conducts smarter, 
more effective outreach on behalf of the health plans through its proven approach to engaging costly, complex populations with unaddressed behavioral conditions and chronic disease.
Our engagement process is rooted in understanding the whole person and their individual barriers to healthcare access. Ontrak conducts multichannel outreach under its model of coaching to engage and enroll the members that are identified in its initial identification phase as described above. We use motivational interviewing, which is an evidence-based approach to behavioral change to identify participants' values, goals, needs, abilities and barriers. By understanding members on a more personal level, our team of trained, dedicated member engagement specialists and care coaches work together to remove barriers and drive program engagement, resulting in better retention that leads to better healthcare outcomes for members and reducing avoidable costs for health plans. Ontrak's enrollment specialists and care coaches build trust using a whole-person approach that aligns with each member's individualized concerns and challenges, including understanding their total health needs and identifying and removing barriers to care. Ontrak's model drives exceptionally high member engagement with the program, even among those who have failed in other behavior change programs. 
Treat
Hard-to-engage populations need a high-touch solution. Our Ontrak solution provides personalized, thoughtful plans of care by combining care coaching, innovative psychosocial and medical treatment delivered through a proprietary provider network. The solution is designed to help payors treat and manage populations struggling with substance use disorder, depression and anxiety to improve their health and thereby decrease their overall health care costs.
Enrolled members receive care coaching and the opportunity to participate in telehealth or face-to-face evidence-based psychosocial and pharmacological treatment from our proprietary network of third-party providers. Ontrak care coaches guide members to relevant clinical pathways and providers, and stay connected to each member throughout the 12-month Ontrak program to ensure that social determinants of health are assessed and addressed with the same level of attention as behavioral health risks. Our dedicated care coaches focus on member skill building and personal health goals, while coordinating care with a tightly integrated network of therapists, psychiatrists and addiction specialists who provide behavioral health treatment to address underlying behavioral conditions.
Activate
Upon graduation from our Ontrak program, members have overcome barriers to care, realized durable behavior changes, and are actively managing their health by staying engaged with their primary care physician, behavioral provider(s) and health plan.
For graduated members, Ontrak's differentiated, high-touch approach to engagement results in lasting improvements in clinical outcomes, while driving significant, durable cost savings for health plans by reducing avoidable emergency department and inpatient utilization. 
We believe the benefits of Ontrak include improved clinical outcomes and decreased costs for the payor, as well as improved quality of life for the member. We provide outcomes reporting to payors on a periodic basis to demonstrate the value of the program. 
Market for Employer Mental Health and Wellbeing Support Services
Under our LifeDojo solution, our science-backed behavior change platform, we provide mental health and wellbeing support to members of employer customers. The LifeDojo approach to member-centric behavior change delivers lasting health improvement outcomes, high enrollment and better engagement than traditional programs, making transformative life changes possible for members.
Our Marketing Strategy
We are currently marketing our Ontrak solution to payors on a case rate, monthly fee, or fee for service basis, which involves educating them on the disproportionately high cost of their population with unaddressed behavioral health conditions that exacerbate medical comorbidities and demonstrating the potential for Ontrak to reduce these costs. 
How Whole-Person Care Delivers Meaningful Outcomes That Last
In mid-2021, we presented a landmark behavioral study of the real-world impact of the Ontrak program, called the "Treatment Effect of the Ontrak Program" at the American Health Insurance Plans event. The treatment effect study reviewed healthcare utilization and costs over a 36-month period and compared the outcomes for Ontrak graduates to a propensity-matched group of individuals who were eligible to enroll but did not. The treatment effect study demonstrated our program's ability to effectively help health plans engage hard-to-reach populations and reduce costs by reducing avoidable inpatient utilization and increasing use of productive, preventive care. Health plans saw the following results for each Ontrak graduate in the study:
•$486 per member per month savings, durable 24 months post-enrollment
•64% reduction in avoidable inpatient utilization
•50% increase in preventive care services 
The Treatment Effect Study demonstrates that Ontrak's behavioral health interventions work over the long-term, resulting in better outcomes for members and significant cost-savings for payors, and should be integrated as a critical component of healthcare plans. 
We have validated, durable medical claims savings and ROI outcomes across all lines of business, including Medicare, Medicaid and commercial health plan members. In addition to medical claims savings, our members, once enrolled, increase preventive and managed care utilization, closing gaps in care, thereby becoming more self-sustaining individuals. 
Recent Developments
Corporate Name and Ticker Symbol Change
On July 6, 2020, we changed our corporate name from Catasys, Inc. to Ontrak, Inc. and changed our NASDAQ ticker symbol from CATS to OTRK effective July 7, 2020. We believe the change in our name leverages our national brand recognition of the Company's Ontrak solutions among our health plan members, health plan customers and network of behavioral health providers. 
Acquisition
On October 28, 2020, we completed the acquisition of LifeDojo Inc. (“LifeDojo”), a comprehensive, science-backed behavior change platform based in San Francisco, California. LifeDojo provides online behavior change and wellness programs, using a combination of coaching and mobile apps to help members form health habits and change health behaviors. This acquisition expands the total addressable market by enabling the creation of lower cost digital interventions across behavioral health and chronic disease populations. LifeDojo's member-facing app also enhances our market leading behavioral engagement capabilities. 
Customer Notifications
On August 18, 2021, we received a termination notice from a large customer of their intent not to continue the program past December 31, 2021. We believe the notification was for reasons specific to the customer’s corporate shift in strategic direction. On February 26, 2021, we were notified by our then largest customer that the participation status with this customer would be terminated. Each of these customers' members have completed their participation in our program as of December 31, 2021. As a result of each of these customer termination notices, we implemented a reduction in workforce and a restructuring plan as part of management's cost saving measures in order to reduce its operating costs, optimize its business model and help align with its previously stated strategic initiatives. 
Regulatory Matters
The healthcare industry is highly regulated and continues to undergo significant changes. Healthcare companies are subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local laws, regulations and judicial decisions. For more information about regulatory matters, see discussion under "Risks related to our healthcare industry" in Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.
Human Capital Resources 
We believe our employees are among our most important resources and are critical to the continued success of our business. We are focused on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals across all areas of our business and committed to hiring, developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. All of our employees are required to adhere to a professional 
code of conduct and comply with annual training on, but not limited to, raising awareness, preventing and reporting any type of unlawful discrimination. We are not a party to any labor agreements and none of our employees are represented by a labor union.
As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 252 employees, which included 231 full-time, 20 part-time and one temporary employees, and represented a 65% year-over-year decrease in our total employee headcount, reflecting the reduction in workforce discussed above. A majority of our employee base is comprised of care coaches, member engagement specialists and other staff directly involved in member care, as well as research and development, engineering and administrative team members. We expect our headcount to continue to fluctuate for the foreseeable future as we continue to make strategic investments to support the growth of our business. 
In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we had a total of approximately 50 independent contractors who provide us various consulting services, including recruiting, health network providers, marketing and other professional services, that are important to the operation of our business.
