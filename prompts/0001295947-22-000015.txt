ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Unless otherwise indicated by the context, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or “Prestige” refer to Prestige Consumer Healthcare Inc. and our subsidiaries. Prior to August 17, 2018, the Company's name was Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc.  Reference to a year (e.g., “2022”) refers to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year.
We formed as a Delaware corporation in 1996 and are engaged in the development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of well-recognized, brand name, over-the-counter (“OTC”) health and personal care products to mass merchandisers, drug, food, dollar, convenience, club and e-commerce stores in North America (the United States and Canada) and in Australia and certain other international markets.  We use the strength of our brands, our established retail distribution network, a low-cost operating model and our experienced management team to our competitive advantage.  Our ultimate success is dependent on several factors, including our ability to:
•Develop and execute effective sales, advertising and marketing programs to maintain or grow our share versus competitors over time;
•Establish and maintain our third-party manufacturing and distribution relationships to fulfill customer demands;
•Develop innovative new products;
•Continue to grow our presence in the United States and international markets through acquisitions and organic growth; and;
•Allocate capital effectively.
We have grown our product portfolio both organically and through acquisitions. We develop our existing brands by investing in new product lines, brand extensions and strong advertising support. Acquisitions of consumer health and personal care brands have also been an important part of our growth strategy. We pursue this growth following an acquisition through spending on advertising and marketing support, new sales and marketing strategies, improved packaging and formulations and innovative development of brand extensions. 
We conduct our operations in two reportable segments: North American OTC Healthcare and International OTC Healthcare. 

Our business, business model, competitive strengths and growth strategy face various risks that are described in "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The following summarizes the percent of our net revenues by segment:

 | March 31, | 
(In thousands) | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Segment: | | | | | 
North American OTC Healthcare | 89.1 | % | | 90.0 | % | 89.2 | %
International OTC Healthcare | 10.9 | | | 10.0 | | 10.8 | 
Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

(1)We have prepared the information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with regard to the market position for our brands based in part on data generated by Information Resources, Inc. (“IRI”), for the 52-week period ended March 20, 2022. International information was derived from several sources. Fess and Hydralyte data are for the Australian market. 
(2)“Market segment” is defined by us and is either a standard IRI category or a segment within a standard IRI category and is based on our product offerings and the categories in which we compete. 
(3)Some brands in the North American OTC Healthcare segment are also sold in the International OTC Healthcare segment.
Our products are sold through multiple channels, including mass merchandisers, drug, food, dollar, convenience, club and e-commerce stores, which reduces our exposure to any single distribution channel.  
Market Position
During 2022, approximately 67.5% of our total revenues were from major brands with a number one market position, compared with approximately 69.2% and 69.4% of total revenues during 2021 and 2020, respectively.  In 2022, these brands included BC and Goody's, Chloraseptic, Clear Eyes, Compound W, Debrox, Dramamine, Fess, Fleet, Gaviscon, Hydralyte, Monistat, Nix, and Summer's Eve. 
Competitive Strengths and Growth Strategy
We believe that our product portfolio is positioned for long-term growth based on the following factors: 
Diversified Portfolio of Well-Recognized and Established Consumer Brands
We own and market a diverse portfolio of well-recognized consumer brands, some of which were established over 100 years ago.  Our diverse portfolio of products provides us with multiple sources of growth and minimizes our reliance on any one product or category. We provide significant marketing support to our portfolio, which is designed to enhance our sales growth and our long-term profitability across our major brands and other significant brands, sometimes referred to as core brands.  
Strong Competitor in Attractive Categories
We compete in product categories that address recurring consumer needs.  We believe we are well positioned in these categories due to the long history and consumer awareness of our brands, our strong market positions, and our low-cost operating model. The markets in which we sell our products, however, are highly competitive and include numerous national and global manufacturers, distributors, marketers and retailers. As a result, any one or more of our brands could suffer a decline in market position or sales.
Proven Ability to Develop and Introduce New Products
We focus our marketing and product development efforts on the identification of under-served consumer needs, the design of products that directly address those needs, and the ability to extend our highly recognizable brand names to other products. One of our strategies is to broaden the categories in which we participate and increase our share within those categories through ongoing product innovation. As an example of this philosophy, in 2022 we launched a number of new products, including DenTek Fresh Protect Dental Guards, Dramamine Nausea Ginger Chews, BC Max Strength Lemonade-flavored powder, Summer’s Eve Spa Luxurious Wash and Clear Eyes Sensitive. In 2021, we launched Summer's Eve Active Chafe Gel and Sprays, Monistat Feminine Cleanser, and Compound W Gel Plus ConSeal Patches. While there is always a risk that sales of existing products may be reduced by new product introductions, our goal is to grow the overall sales of our brands.
Investments in Advertising and Marketing
We invest in advertising and marketing to drive the growth of our core brands.  Our marketing strategy is focused primarily on consumer-oriented initiatives that target consumers via mass media, digital marketing, in-store programming and coupons. While the absolute level of marketing expenditures differs by brand and category, we have often increased the amount of investment in our brands after acquiring them. 
Increasing Distribution Across Multiple Channels
Our broad distribution base attempts to ensure that our products are well positioned across all available channels and that we are able to participate in changing consumer retail trends.  In an effort to ensure continued sales growth, we continue to focus on expanding our reliance on direct sales while reducing our reliance on brokers for our customers, other than our top 25 customers.  
Pursuing Strategic Acquisitions
Acquisitions are a part of our overall strategy for growing revenue. We have a history of growth through acquisitions. In 2022, we acquired the consumer health business assets from Akorn Operating Company LLC. While we believe that there will continue to be a pipeline of acquisition candidates for us to investigate, strategic fit, availability of capital and relative cost are of the utmost importance in our decision to pursue such opportunities. We believe our business model allows us to integrate acquisitions in an efficient manner, while also providing opportunities to realize significant cost savings. 
Growing Our International Business
International sales beyond the borders of North America represented 10.9%, 10.0% and 10.8% of total revenues in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We have designed and developed both products and packaging for specific international markets and expect that our international revenues as a proportion of our total revenues will continue to grow over the long-term. 
A number of our brands have previously been sold internationally, and we seek to expand the number of brands sold through our existing international distribution network and continue to identify additional distribution partners for further expansion of our brands into other international markets. 
Efficient Operating Model
To gain operating efficiencies, we oversee the production planning and quality control aspects of the manufacturing, warehousing and distribution of our products, while we primarily outsource the operating elements of these functions to well-established third-party providers.  This approach allows us to benefit from their core competencies and maintain a highly variable cost structure with low overhead, limited working capital requirements, and minimal investment in capital expenditures.
Management Team with Proven Ability to Acquire, Integrate and Grow Brands
Our business has grown through acquisition and expansion of the many brands we have purchased as a result of the efforts of our experienced management team. Our management team has significant experience in consumer product marketing, sales, legal and regulatory compliance, product development and customer service.  We rely on experienced personnel to bear the substantial responsibility of brand management and to effectuate our growth strategy. 
Marketing and Sales
Our marketing strategy is based primarily on the acquisition and renovation of established consumer brands that possess what we believe to be significant brand value and unrealized potential and to grow categories with existing brands where we have leading market positions.  Our marketing objective is to increase sales and market share by developing innovative new products and line extensions and executing creative and cost-effective advertising and marketing programs. This brand-building process involves the evaluation of the existing brand name, the development and introduction of innovative new products, and the execution of marketing support programs. Brand priorities will vary from year-to-year.  Recognizing that financial resources are limited, we allocate our resources to focus on our core brands with the most impactful, consumer-relevant initiatives that we believe have the greatest opportunities for growth and financial success.  
Customers 
Our senior management team and dedicated sales force strive to maintain long-standing relationships with our top 25 domestic customers.  We also contract with third-party sales management enterprises that interface directly with many of our remaining customers and report directly to members of our sales management team. In an effort to ensure continued sales growth, we continue to focus on expanding our reliance on direct sales while reducing our reliance on brokers for our non-top 25 customers. 
We enjoy broad distribution across each of the major retail channels, including mass merchandisers, drug, food, dollar, convenience, club and e-commerce stores.  The following table sets forth the percentage of gross sales for our domestic customers across our six major distribution channels during each of the past three years ended March 31:

 | Percentage of Gross Sales(1)
Channel of Distribution | 2022 | 2021 | | 2020
Mass | 34.3 | | 34.5 | | 36.5
Drug | 25.4 | | 22.4 | | 25.6
Food | 13.9 | | 15.0 | | 15.4
Dollar | 6.3 | | 7.7 | | 6.6 
Convenience | 3.5 | | 3.2 | | 3.9 
Club | 1.6 | | 1.8 | | 1.4 
Other (2) | 15.0 | | 15.4 | | 10.6

(1)Includes estimates for some of our wholesale customers that service more than one distribution channel.
(2)Includes e-commerce retailers such as Amazon.
Due to the diversity of our product lines, we believe that each of these channels is important to our business, and we continue to seek opportunities for growth in each channel.
We believe that our emphasis on strong customer relationships, speed and flexibility and leading sales technology capabilities, combined with consistent marketing support programs and ongoing product innovation, will continue to maximize our competitiveness in the increasingly complex retail environment.
During 2022, 2021, and 2020, Walmart accounted for approximately 20.5%, 21.6%, and 23.1%, respectively, of our gross revenues. We expect that for future periods, our top ten customers, including Walmart, will in the aggregate continue to account for a large portion of our sales.
Outsourcing and Manufacturing
In order to maximize our competitiveness and efficiently allocate our resources, third-party manufacturers fulfill most of our manufacturing needs.  We have found that contract manufacturing often maximizes our flexibility and responsiveness to industry and consumer trends while minimizing the need for capital expenditures.  We select contract manufacturers based on their core competencies and our perception of the best overall value, including factors such as (i) depth of services, (ii) professionalism and integrity of the management team, (iii) manufacturing agility, quality and capacity, (iv) regulatory compliance, and (v) competitive pricing. We require each of our suppliers, most of whom are based in the United States and Canada, to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which sets forth the basic and minimal expectations that all suppliers must meet in order to do business with us. We also conduct thorough reviews of each potential manufacturer’s facilities, quality standards, capacity and financial stability.  We generally purchase only finished products from our manufacturers.
Our primary contract manufacturers provide comprehensive services from product development through the manufacturing of finished goods.  This approach results in minimal capital expenditures and maximizes our cash flow, which allows us to reinvest to support our marketing initiatives, fund brand acquisitions or repay outstanding indebtedness.
At March 31, 2022, we had relationships with 128 third-party manufacturers.  Of those, we had long-term contracts with 23 manufacturers that produced items that accounted for approximately 69.0% of our gross sales for 2022, compared to 19 manufacturers with long-term contracts that accounted for approximately 70.5% of our gross sales in 2021.  The fact that we do not have long-term contracts with certain manufacturers means that they could cease manufacturing our products at any time and for any reason or initiate arbitrary and costly price increases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Although we are in the process of negotiating long-term contracts with certain key manufacturers, we may not be able to reach a timely agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Our long-term supply and manufacturing agreements explicitly outline the manufacturers’ obligations and product specifications with respect to the brand or brands being produced, including allocation of product liability risk. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, the purchase price of products is subject to change due to fluctuations in input costs such as raw material, packaging components and labor costs. 
Some of our other products are manufactured on a purchase order basis, which is generally based on batch sizes and results in no long-term obligations or commitments. To the extent we rely on purchase orders, rather than supply and manufacturing agreements, to govern our commercial relationships with suppliers, we typically rely on implied warranties with respect to the products manufactured, and we do not have specifically negotiated allocation of risk with these third-party manufacturers. With regard to our products both manufactured under long-term agreements and purchase orders, in periods of high inflation we have experienced and may continue to experience frequent increases in prices of products due to availability and fluctuations in input costs such as raw material, packaging components and labor costs.
In addition to relying on contract manufacturers, we operate a manufacturing facility in Lynchburg, Virginia, which manufactures products accounting for approximately 13% of our gross sales. We intend to move the manufacture of certain of our more highly regulated products to our facility in the future.
We believe that most of the raw materials and packaging components used to produce our products at our manufacturing facility in Virginia and at our third-party manufacturing facilities are generally available through multiple sources acquired on both a contract and purchase order basis but are also subject to inflationary pressure. 
Warehousing and Distribution
We manage product distribution in the continental United States through one facility, which is owned and operated by GEODIS Logistics LLC ("GEODIS"), a third-party provider. We entered into an agreement with GEODIS in May 2019 and transitioned to this facility from our previous provider during fiscal 2020. GEODIS provides warehouse services including storage, handling and shipping, as well as transportation services, with respect to our full line of products, including (i) complete management services, (ii) carrier claims administration, (iii) proof of delivery, (iv) procurement, (v) report generation, and (vi) freight payment services.
Competition
The business of selling brand name consumer products in the OTC health and personal care market is highly competitive.  This market includes numerous national and global manufacturers, distributors, marketers and retailers that actively compete for consumers’ business both in the United States and abroad.  In addition, like most companies that market products in this category, we are experiencing continued competition from “private label” products introduced by major retail chains.  While we believe that our branded products provide superior quality and benefits, we are unable to predict the extent to which consumers will purchase “private label” products as an alternative to branded products, although we expect that this could increase during an economic downturn or periods of high inflation. 
Our principal competitors include AbbVie, Alcon, Bausch Health Companies Inc., Bayer, Combe, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Mondelez International, Reckitt Benckiser, Sanofi, Sunstar Group, The Honey Pot Company, and The Procter & Gamble Company.
We compete on the basis of numerous factors, including brand recognition, product quality, performance, value to customers, price, and product availability at the retail and e-commerce level.  Advertising, marketing, merchandising and packaging, the timing of new product introductions, and line extensions also have a significant impact on customers’ buying decisions and, as a result, on our sales.  The structure and quality of our sales force, as well as sell-through of our products, affect in-store and online positioning, wall display space and inventory levels for retail sale.  Our markets are also highly sensitive to the introduction of new products, which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market.  
Many of the competitors noted above are larger and have substantially greater research and development and financial resources than we do, and may therefore have the ability to spend more aggressively and consistently on research and development, advertising and marketing, and to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. See “Competitive Strengths” above for additional information regarding our competitive strengths and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” below for additional information regarding competition in our industry.
Regulation 
Product Regulation
The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale and storage of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various U.S. federal agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”), and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured, marketed, distributed and sold. Our Regulatory and Quality team is guided by a senior member of management and staffed by individuals with appropriate quality, legal and regulatory experience. Our Regulatory, Quality and Operations teams work closely with our third-party manufacturers and our own manufacturing operation on quality-related matters. We monitor our own manufacturing operations and our third-party manufacturers' compliance with FDA and relevant foreign regulations and perform periodic audits to ensure compliance. This continual evaluation process is designed to ensure that our manufacturing processes and products are of high quality and in compliance with known regulatory and quality requirements. If the FDA or a foreign governmental authority chooses to audit a particular third-party manufacturing facility, we require the third-party manufacturer to notify us immediately and update us on the progress of the audit as it proceeds. If we or our manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could become subject to significant claims or penalties or be required to discontinue the sale of the non-compliant products. In addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant additional compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales.
Most of our U.S. OTC drug products are regulated pursuant to the FDA’s monograph system. The monographs set out the active ingredients and labeling indications that are permitted for certain broad categories of U.S. OTC drug products. When the FDA has finalized a particular monograph, it has concluded that a properly labeled product formulation is generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. A tentative final monograph indicates that the FDA has not made a final determination about products in a category to establish safety and efficacy for a product and its uses. However, unless there is a serious safety or efficacy issue, the FDA typically will exercise enforcement discretion and permit companies to sell products conforming to a tentative final monograph until the final monograph is published. Products that comply with either final or tentative final monograph standards do not require pre-market approval from the FDA.
Certain of our U.S. OTC drug products are New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) products and are manufactured and labeled in accordance with an FDA-approved submission. These products are subject to 
reporting requirements as set forth in FDA regulations. Moving forward, OTC drug products will fall under the requirements of The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") signed into law on March 27, 2020, which includes the Over-the-Counter Monograph Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act. These new requirements are expected to be delineated by the FDA in 2023/2024.
Certain of our U.S. OTC Healthcare products are medical devices regulated by the FDA through a system that may involve pre-market clearance. During the review process, the FDA makes an affirmative determination as to the sufficiency of the label directions, cautions and warnings for the medical devices in question.
Certain of our products are considered cosmetics regulated by the FDA through the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDC Act") and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. The FDA does not require pre-market clearance for cosmetics but manufacturers must ensure the products are not adulterated or misbranded. 
In accordance with the FDC Act and FDA regulations, we and our third-party manufacturers of U.S. products must also comply with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMPs”). The FDA inspects our facilities and those of our third-party manufacturers periodically to determine that both we and our third-party manufacturers are complying with GMPs. We intend to move the manufacture of certain of our more regulated products to our own manufacturing facility, which will subject our facility to increased regulatory requirements and scrutiny with respect to both our existing and new operations there.
Our dietary supplement products are governed by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ("DSHEA"), which defines and regulates dietary supplements. Under DSHEA, supplements are also effectively regulated by the FDA for GMPs.
A number of our products are regulated by the CPSC under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (“FHSA”), the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (the “PPPA”) and the Consumer Products Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (“CPSIA”). In addition, a small number of our products are subject to regulation under the PPPA and can only be legally marketed if they are dispensed in child-resistant packaging or labeled for use in households where there are no children. The CPSIA requires us to make available to our customers certificates stating that we are in compliance with any applicable regulation administered by the CPSC. 
Nix Lice Control Spray is considered a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”). Generally speaking, any substance intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest is considered to be a pesticide under FIFRA. Pesticides under FIFRA are required to be registered with the EPA and contain certain disclosures on the product labels. In addition, the contract manufacturers from which we source these products must be registered with the EPA. Our EPA registered products are also subject to state regulations and the rules and regulations of the various jurisdictions where these products are sold.
Our Canadian and international business is also subject to product regulations by local regulatory authorities in the various countries where these businesses operate, including regulations regarding manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution, sale and storage.
Sustainability and Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Regulations 
We believe that sustainable operations are both financially and operationally beneficial to our business, and critical to the health of the communities in which we operate. Our operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations relating to environmental concerns, including air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste management activities, and the safety of our employees. We endeavor to take actions necessary to comply with such regulations, including periodic environmental and health and safety audits of our facilities. The audits, conducted by independent firms with expertise in environmental, health and safety compliance, include site visits as well as a review of documentary information, to determine compliance with such federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations. We seek to ensure responsible sourcing of our products and to improve our suppliers’ environmental, labor, health and safety and ethical practices through our Supplier Code of Conduct. We seek to minimize our resource footprint at our locations with a focus on managing waste, water and energy consumption.
Other Regulations
We are also subject to a variety of other regulations in various foreign markets, including regulations pertaining to import/export, antitrust and pharmacovigilance issues. To the extent we decide to commence or expand operations in additional 
countries, we may be required to obtain an approval, license or certification from the country’s ministry of health or comparable agency. We must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that may vary from country to country. Government regulations in both our domestic and international markets can delay or prevent the introduction, or require the reformulation or withdrawal, of some of our products. Our failure to comply with these regulations can also result in a product being removed from sale in a particular market, either temporarily or permanently. In addition, we are subject to FTC and state regulations, as well as foreign regulations, relating to our product claims and advertising. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions and the imposition of penalties.
Impact of Regulations
Compliance with these various regulations has an impact on capital expenditures, earnings and our competitive position. Additional or shifting governmental regulation has and in the future could require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of certain products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, expanded adverse event reporting or other new requirements. Those changes have and will continue to require capital investments in facilities and equipment to meet the requirements, as well as additional product development, material and production costs which may impact our earnings, financial condition and ability to compete.
Intellectual Property
We own a number of trademark registrations and applications in the United States, Canada and other foreign countries.  The following are some of the most significant registered trademarks we own in the United States and/or Canada:  BC, Boudreaux's Butt Paste, Chloraseptic, Clear Eyes, Compound W, Debrox, DenTek, Dramamine, Fleet, Gaviscon, Goody's, Hydralyte, Luden's, Monistat, Nix, Summer's Eve, Fess and TheraTears. 
Our trademarks and tradenames are how we convey that the products we sell are “brand name” products.  Our ownership of these trademarks and tradenames is very important to our business, as it allows us to compete based on the value and goodwill associated with these marks.  Additionally, we own or license patents on innovative and proprietary technology.  The patents evidence the unique nature of our products, provide us with exclusivity, and afford us protection from the encroachment of others.  None of the patents that we own or license, however, is material to us on a consolidated basis. Enforcing our rights, or the rights of any of our licensors, represented by these trademarks, tradenames and patents is critical to our business and may require significant expense.  If we are not able to effectively enforce our rights, others may be able to dilute our trademarks, tradenames and patents and diminish the value associated with our brands and technologies.
We do not own all of the intellectual property rights applicable to our products.  In those cases where our third-party manufacturers own patents that protect our products, we are dependent on them as a source of supply for our products. In addition, we rely on our suppliers for their enforcement of their intellectual property rights against infringing products.
Seasonality
The first quarter of our fiscal year generally is the least profitable quarter due to the increased advertising and marketing spending to support those brands with a summer selling season, such as Clear Eyes products and Compound W, and generally the lowest level of sales attributable to multiple factors.  The effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns in the third quarter influences sales of products such as Chloraseptic, Little Remedies, and Luden's during the fourth quarter cough and cold winter months.  Additionally, the fourth quarter typically has the lowest level of advertising and marketing spending as a percent of revenue. 
Human Capital Management
Our Culture & Diversity
Our mission is to deliver high-quality consumer health and personal care products that improve and enrich the lives of our consumers. Our Company culture is founded on the principles of Leadership, Trust, Change and Execution. Of those principles, Trust is among the most important. Trust in the safety and performance of our products, the integrity of our manufacturing and marketing processes, the character of our people, and the benefit to our consumers and society. We also reward employees who take ownership and embody our principle of Leadership with projects that positively impact our business, community and stakeholders. 
We take pride in the wide range of backgrounds, races, nationalities, personalities, ideas, and talents that make up our organization. We continue to build on our long commitment of equal employment opportunity and anti-discrimination by consciously and proactively promoting inclusion and equity of people with unique cultural and ethnic heritage, color and backgrounds, gender identification and sexual orientation, and other traits. We endeavor to facilitate the acquisition of diverse attitudes, skills and talents particularly for future leadership roles through hiring, workplace practices and employee 
development. We strive to create and sustain an environment where all employees are heard and inspired to achieve their full potential. We continually review our Company employee demographics to help us adhere to these principles. 
We also believe in working productively with one another and with our stakeholders to ensure long-term success. Some of the ways we encourage this is by:
•Recruiting: With employees across the U.S. and the world, we understand the importance of hiring and advancement practices that ensure diversity and equality at all levels of the organization as well as talent development.
•Monitoring: We have a strict Code of Conduct and Ethics that fosters a work environment that is free from intimidation, harassment and violence. Our team employs a process to investigate and resolve any potential conduct or ethics concern that may violate our mission of diversity and inclusion. We use a third-party reporting avenue for employees to exercise any such concern with anonymity and confidentiality. Raising a concern honestly or participating in an investigation cannot be the basis for any adverse employment action, including termination, suspension, loss of benefits, threats, harassment or discrimination.
Our Employees
As of March 31, 2022, we had approximately 535 global employees. Approximately 90% of our workforce operates in the United States, 9% in Australia and Asia and 1% in Europe. 60% of our employees are salaried and 40% are paid hourly wages, mostly in production. We employ only a few part time employees. Our workforce is 52% female and 48% male. None of our employees are a party to a collective bargaining agreement. Management believes that our relations with employees are good. 
Strategic Development and Empowerment
We encourage all employees to achieve their full potential by participating in our mentorship opportunities, career development programs and Company-provided learning tools. We provide meaningful responsibility and development opportunities to our employees worldwide. We employ a performance management process under which all employees receive reviews that not only assess performance, but identify specific developmental opportunities and learning goals for the individual. By empowering our employees to develop and enhance their skills through enterprise-wide tools, videos and coursework that focus on continuous learning and professional and personal development, we help all of our employees reach their full potential, which in turn helps our organization succeed. 
Health and Safety
We are committed to providing a safe work environment for our employees and require employees to share this concern by abiding to rigorous safety measures. To enable this and assure that the message of health, safety and well-being are part of our work culture, we conduct regular training programs at our production facility. We seek to comply with all federal, state and/or local occupational safety and health standards and report our safety records in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"). 
In March 2020, we implemented protocols in response to the COVID-19 pandemic across all locations, in an effort to ensure both the safety of our employees and compliance with federal and local requirements and guidelines. These protocols continued through fiscal 2022. During the pandemic, our dedicated production employees at our manufacturing facility in Lynchburg, VA continued to operate three shifts a day with enhanced safety and health measures in place to protect their well-being. Our office-based employees were initially transitioned to a remote workforce but later returned to the office with appropriate safeguards to protect their health and well-being. These measures have allowed employees the flexibility to attend to other unique personal and family needs brought on by the pandemic.
Our Community
We are a responsible corporate citizen and we resolve to live by our principles as we continue to grow our global business. We seek out opportunities to be active members of our communities to enhance the lives of our neighbors and consumers. We encourage employees to become involved in their respective communities, and we enable office locations the freedom to develop programs that are appropriate to their community needs. For example, our corporate headquarters office location traditionally has an annual “Day of Giving” where employees spend a day every December giving back to the nearby communities, while other office locations support their communities through various volunteerism events. With the pandemic and employees working remotely, our charitable efforts this year focused on feeding those in need in the communities where employees live and a Company contribution to Feeding Westchester, a nonprofit hunger relief network of food banks across the County of Westchester, NY.

Economic Environment 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization ("WHO") declared a global pandemic due to a new strain of coronavirus ("COVID-19"). The pandemic has caused significant volatility in the United States and global economies. In addition, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to further economic uncertainty. We expect economic conditions will continue to be highly volatile and uncertain and could affect demand for our products and put pressure on prices. We experienced a temporary but significant decline in consumer consumption of our brands in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, followed by more stable consumption and customer orders over the remainder of the year. Generally, throughout the pandemic, some categories were positively impacted (for instance, Women’s Health, Oral Care and Dermatological) and some categories negatively impacted (for instance, Cough & Cold and Gastrointestinal). The positively impacted categories benefited from the consumer shift to over-the-counter healthcare products, as consumers increased their focus on hygiene and self-care at home related to COVID-19. The declining categories were impacted by reduced incidence levels and usage rates due to shelter-at-home restrictions and limited travel-related activity. In fiscal 2022, we experienced solid consumer consumption and share gains across most of our brand portfolio. Our business also benefited from a significant increase in demand in travel-related categories and channels as well as the Cough & Cold category, previously impacted by the COVID-19 virus. We have continued to see changes in the purchasing patterns of our consumers, including the frequency of visits by consumers to retailers and a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online.
Both the COVID-19 pandemic and the geopolitical environment have also impacted the supply of labor and raw materials and exacerbated rising costs. Although we have not experienced a material disruption to our overall supply chain to date, we have and may continue to experience delays and backorders for certain ingredients and products, difficulty scheduling shipping for our products, as well as price increases from many of our suppliers for both shipping and product costs. In addition, labor shortages have impacted our manufacturing operations and may impact our ability to supply certain products to our customers. To date, the pandemic and other global conditions have not had a material negative impact on our operations, supply chain, overall costs or demand for most of our products or resulting aggregate sales and earnings, and, as such, it has also not negatively impacted our liquidity position. We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs. These circumstances could change, however, in this dynamic, unprecedented environment. If the COVID-19 outbreak worsens or geopolitical conditions cause further disruption in the global supply chain, the availability of labor or otherwise increase costs, it may materially affect our operations and those of third parties on which we rely, including causing disruptions in the supply and distribution of our products. The extent to which these conditions impact our results and liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity and duration of any further COVID-19 outbreak and recovery period and further global instability. These effects could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, capital resources, and results of operations and those of the third parties on which we rely.
