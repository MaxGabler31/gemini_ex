Business Overview
 Kaiser Aluminum Corporation, a Delaware corporation, manufactures and sells semi-fabricated specialty aluminum mill products for the following end market applications: (i) aerospace and high strength (“Aero/HS products”); (ii) beverage and food packaging products (“Packaging”); (iii) automotive (“Automotive Extrusions”); (iv) general engineering (“GE products”); and (v) other industrial (“Other products”). Our fabricated aluminum mill products include flat-rolled (plate, sheet and coil), extruded (rod, bar, hollows and shapes), drawn (rod, bar, pipe, tube and wire) and certain cast aluminum products. The sophistication of our products is due to the metallurgy and physical properties of the metal and the special characteristics that are required for particular end uses. We strategically choose to serve technically challenging applications for which we can deploy our core metallurgical and process technology capabilities to produce highly engineered mill products with differentiated characteristics that present opportunities for us to receive premium pricing and to create long-term profitable growth. A fundamental part of our business model is to remain neutral to the impact from fluctuations in the market price for aluminum and certain alloys, thereby earning profit predominately from the

conversion of aluminum into semi-fabricated mill products. We refer to this as “metal price neutrality.” See “Pricing, Metal Price Risk Management and Hedging” section below for more details. 
 With respect to the global market for flat-rolled aluminum mill products, our focus is on heat treat plate and sheet for applications that require higher strength and other desired product attributes that cannot be achieved by common alloy rolled products. The primary end market applications of flat-rolled heat treat plate and sheet are Aero/HS products (which we sell globally) and GE products (which we predominantly sell within North America). On March 31, 2021, with the completion of our acquisition of Alcoa Warrick LLC and certain assets comprising the aluminum casting and rolling mill facility located in Warrick County, Indiana (collectively, “Warrick”), we expanded our flat‑rolled aluminum products to include bare and coated aluminum coil for can stock applications in the beverage and food packaging industry in North America. 
 Similarly, in the areas of extruded and drawn aluminum mill products, our focus is on Aero/HS products, Automotive Extrusions and GE products for demanding applications that require high strength, machinability or other specific properties where we can create and maintain a defensible competitive position. We primarily serve North American demand for extruded and drawn aluminum mill products.
 Our rolling mill in Spokane, Washington (“Trentwood”) produces heat treat plate and sheet for aerospace and general engineering end market applications and our Warrick facility produces bare and coated aluminum coil used for can stock applications in the beverage and food packaging industry. Our 11 extrusion/drawing facilities, 10 of which are in the United States and one of which is in Canada, serve aerospace, automotive or general engineering applications. Our facility located in Columbia, New Jersey focuses on multi-material advanced manufacturing methods and techniques which include multi-axis computer numerical control (“CNC”) machining, additive manufacturing (“3D Printing”), welding and fabrication for demanding aerospace and defense, automotive, high tech and general industrial applications. In 2021, our consolidated Net sales totaled $2.6 billion on 1,121.6 million pounds shipped from our facilities.
 We purchase primary and scrap, or recycled, aluminum, our main raw material, and alloys at prices that fluctuate on a monthly basis, and our pricing policies generally allow us to pass the underlying cost of aluminum and alloys through to our customers so that we remain neutral to metal pricing. However, for some of our higher value added revenue products sold on a spot basis, competitive dynamics may limit the amount and/or delay the timing of selling price increases to recover our increased aluminum and alloy costs, resulting in a lag up to several months during which we may be exposed to metal price risk. As a result, we can experience an adverse impact when aluminum and alloy prices increase and a favorable impact to us when aluminum and alloy prices decline, as we and our competitors tend to defer adjusting pricing unless market dynamics require such in a declining metal cost environment. Additionally, we sometimes enter into firm-price customer sales agreements that specify a firm underlying metal price plus a conversion price. Spot sales with lagged aluminum and alloy price pass through and firm-price sales agreements create price exposure for us, which we mitigate through hedging and related programs with an objective to remain metal price neutral.
 We have long-standing relationships with our customers, which consist primarily of blue-chip companies including leading aerospace and automotive manufacturers, tier one aerospace and automotive suppliers, metal service centers and beverage and food packaging manufacturers. Approximately 71% of our shipments is sold direct to manufacturers or tier one suppliers and approximately 29% is sold to metal service centers. In our served markets, we seek to be the supplier of choice by pursuing “Best in Class” customer satisfaction driven by quality, availability, service and delivery performance. We believe we differentiate our product portfolio through our broad product offering and our KaiserSelect® products, which are engineered and manufactured to deliver enhanced product characteristics with improved consistency, so as to result in better performance, lower waste and, in many cases, lower production cost for our customers.
 We further strive to enhance the efficiency of product flow to our customers and our status as a supplier of choice by tightly integrating the management of our operations across multiple production facilities, product lines and target markets. Additionally, our strategy to be the supplier of choice and a low cost producer is enabled by a culture of continuous improvement that is facilitated by the Kaiser Production System (“KPS”), an integrated application of tools such as Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma and Total Productive Manufacturing. Using KPS, we seek to continuously reduce our own manufacturing costs and eliminate waste throughout the value chain.
 A key component of our business model is to maintain financial strength and flexibility through the business and economic cycles. We manage and monitor our financial strength through routine analysis of our liquidity position under scenarios of varying business and economic cycles. We also prioritize our capital allocation toward organic growth, such as efficiencies and quality in each of our end markets, while maintaining a strong balance sheet for inorganic opportunities and market growth potential and providing return to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Details of these capital projects are discussed in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Report under the caption, “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Products
 Overview
 Our business focuses on producing rolled, extruded and drawn aluminum products used principally for aerospace and defense, aluminum beverage and food packaging, automotive and general engineering products that include consumer durables, electronics and products for electrical and machinery and equipment applications. Our engineers, metallurgists and sales personnel work collaboratively with our customers to help our customers design products for challenging applications where product performance is critical. Furthermore, our Centers for Excellence, dedicated research and development centers devoted to product performance enhancement and process development within our production operations, are focused on: (i) controlling the manufacturing process; (ii) maximizing the use of recycled aluminum; (iii) improving product quality; and (iv) ensuring consistency and enhanced product attributes. See “Selected Operational and Financial Information” within Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Report for selected shipment and sales information for our fabricated aluminum products by end market application.
 We believe aluminum is highly sustainable because it is infinitely recyclable and the recycling process requires significantly less energy compared with the original mining and refining process. Our highly engineered solutions contribute to reduced carbon emissions by enabling improved performance of consumer products, light‑weighting in applications such as aircraft and transportation for fuel efficiency and increasing the use of recyclable aluminum beverage and food packaging. Overall, we remain focused on providing products that meet the needs of our customers for demanding applications while being part of the carbon solution for “Best in Class” customer satisfaction. 
 Aero/HS Products. Our Aero/HS products include heat treat plate and sheet, hard alloy extruded shapes, cold finish rod and bar, seamless drawn tube and billet used for a wide variety of end uses in the global aerospace and defense industries. Typical applications are structural aircraft components that must perform consistently under extreme variations in temperature and pressure due to frequent take-offs, landings and changes in altitude. Required physical properties include high tensile strength, superior fatigue resistance and exceptional durability even in harsh environments. We use high-strength 2000- and 7000-series alloys and apply a variety of thermal practices to manufacture our Aero/HS products to meet the demanding specifications required for such safety-critical applications. While competing materials such as titanium and composites have displaced aluminum for certain applications on several newer aircraft designs, aluminum continues to be the material used most extensively for structural aerospace and defense applications because it is light weight, can meet demanding performance requirements and is cost effective relative to other materials. 
 Packaging. Our Packaging products consist of bare and coated 3000- and 5000-series alloy aluminum coil used in the beverage and food packaging industry, with applications that include coated food stock, coated end and tab stock, body stock and bottle stock. Our Warrick rolling mill is one of four major aluminum rolling mills currently dedicated to the packaging industry in North America, with one of the world’s largest ingot casting facilities, hot and cold rolling, coated finishing and slitting capacity. The Warrick rolling mill has a unique capability to produce high-margin coated packaging products representing approximately 62% of our total Packaging shipments. 
 Automotive Extrusions. Automotive Extrusions consist of extruded aluminum products for many North American automotive applications. Examples of the variety of extruded products that we supply to the automotive industry include extruded products for the body-in-white structural components, crash management systems, anti-lock braking systems and drawn tube for drive shafts. For some Automotive Extrusions, we perform limited fabrication, including sawing and cutting to length. In recent years, automotive original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and their suppliers have, at an increasing pace, been converting many automotive components that historically were made of steel to aluminum to decrease weight without sacrificing structural integrity and safety performance and thereby achieve greater fuel efficiency standards mandated by stringent United States’ Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) or equivalent state regulations. Our Automotive Extrusions are designed and produced to provide specific mechanical properties and performance attributes required in automotive applications across a broad mix of North American OEMs and automotive platforms. We believe that these attributes are not easily replicated by our competitors and are important to our customers, who are typically tier one automotive suppliers.
 GE Products. Our broad portfolio of GE products consists primarily of 6000-series alloy plate, sheet, rod, bar, tube, wire and standard extruded shapes. The 6000-series alloy is an extremely versatile, medium-strength, heat treatable alloy that can be both extruded and rolled. Our GE products have a wide range of uses and applications, many of which involve further fabrication for numerous transportation and other industrial end market applications where machining of plate, rod and bar is intensive. For example, our GE products are used to produce armor for military vehicles, ordnances, manufacturing cells for semiconductor production, numerous electronic devices, after-market motor sport parts, tooling plate, parts for machinery and equipment, bolts, screws, nails and rivets. 
 5


Other Products. Other products consist of rerolled, extruded, drawn and cast billet aluminum products for a variety of North American industrial end uses. We continue to exit these non-core applications and focus our resources and production capacity on strategic Aero/HS products, Packaging, Automotive Extrusions and GE products.
 Markets
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 Industry sales for fabricated products fluctuate in response to competitive and market dynamics. Sales are made directly to customers by our sales personnel located in the United States, Canada, Western Europe and China and by independent sales agents in other regions of Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on the markets for Aero/HS products, Packaging, Automotive Extrusions and GE products.
 Aero/HS Products. We sell our Aero/HS products to metal service centers, as well as directly to aerospace manufacturers and tier one suppliers. Sales are made primarily under long-term agreements, but also on an order-by-order basis. We serve this market with a North American sales force focused on Aero/HS products and GE products and our sales personnel in Western Europe and China. Growth in demand for aerospace plate has exceeded demand growth for other forms of Aero/HS products, as aircraft manufacturers have migrated to monolithic component design, where a single piece of aluminum, usually a plate, is heavily machined to form a desired part rather than creating the same part by assembling sub-components made of aluminum sheet, extrusions or forgings that are affixed to one another using rivets, bolts or welds. Demand for our Aero/HS products is heavily impacted by commercial airframe build rates and, to a lesser degree, by defense related airframes and other products. In addition, unanticipated changes in build rates and mix of aircraft models being built can trigger restocking or destocking throughout the long aerospace supply chain, temporarily impacting demand. While commercial airframe build rates can be subject to certain short-terms events (see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” included in this Report), we believe the long-term demand for air travel and fuel efficiency will continue to drive long-term growth for our products.
 Packaging. Our Packaging products are sold primarily to North American food packaging manufacturers and beverage can manufacturers and fillers. Sales are made primarily under long-term agreements by a North American direct sales force. Aluminum can stock demand is driven by the packaging industry’s shift towards environmentally sustainable materials due to the fact that aluminum is infinitely recyclable and has the highest consumer recycling rate among beverage containers. Major players have already transitioned some plastic bottled water and carbonated soft drink production to aluminum. We anticipate further growth will be underpinned by sustainability trends, the secular shift from plastic to aluminum and the fact that North American packaging capacity has been reallocated towards other end markets, including automotive and industrial.
 Automotive Extrusions. Our Automotive Extrusions are sold primarily to tier one automotive suppliers. Almost all sales are made under long-term agreements entered through direct channels using a North American direct sales force that works closely with our technical sales support organization. Demand for Automotive Extrusions is determined based upon automotive build rates in North America and aluminum content. We believe fuel efficiency standards, along with consumer preference for larger vehicles and the growing conversion to electric vehicles, will continue to drive growth in demand for aluminum extruded components in passenger vehicles as a replacement for the heavier weight of steel components. 
 GE Products. A majority of our GE products are sold to large metal service centers in North America on an order-by-order basis, with orders primarily consisting of standard catalog type items shipped with a relatively short lead-time. We service this market with a North American sales force focused on GE products and Aero/HS products. Demand for our GE products is closely related to the North America general industrial growth and the recent desire of many companies to lessen their risk of supply chain disruptions by reshoring suppliers and shortening the supply chain. Demand is also impacted by the destocking and restocking of inventory throughout the supply chain.
 Customers
 In 2021, we had 600 customers, including the following key customers: (i) Crown Holdings Inc.; (ii) Ford Motor Company; (iii) Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co.; (iv) Silgan Containers Corporation; and (v) The Boeing Company. While the loss of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on us, we believe that our long-standing relationship with each is good and that the risk of losing any customer is remote. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information about our significant concentrations.
Competition
 The fabricated aluminum industry is highly competitive. We seek to further differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our ongoing investments to continuously improve the quality and machinability of our products, manufacture and deliver unique 
 6


product attributes (KaiserSelect®) and provide a broad product offering while maintaining a strong customer focus to achieve “Best in Class” status in our markets.
 Our primary competitors in the global market for Aero/HS products are Arconic, Inc., Constellium N.V. and Novelis Inc. In North America, our primary competitors for Packaging are Arconic, Inc., Constellium N.V., Novelis, Inc. and Tri-Arrows Aluminum, Inc. In serving our North American customers for both Automotive Extrusions and GE products, our primary competitors are Arconic, Inc. and Norsk Hydro ASA, and for certain of these products, we also compete with smaller, regional participants. In North America, we also compete with general engineering heat treat plate products imported from South Africa, Europe and China. Some of our competitors are substantially larger, have greater financial resources and may have other strategic advantages. 
 Because many of our products are used in safety critical applications, our customers have demanding standards for product quality and consistency that make it difficult to become a qualified supplier. Suppliers must pass a rigorous qualification process to sell to both airframe and automotive manufacturers and must also make significant investments in infrastructure and specialized equipment to supply products for these high strength applications. Further, sophisticated manufacturing processes make it difficult to become a qualified supplier, even with proper equipment. For example, producing heat treat plate and sheet products, particularly for aerospace applications, requires technological expertise that only a few companies have developed through significant investment in research and development and decades of operating experience. To be a supplier in the packaging market, demanding standards are also required. Producing coated end, tab and body stock for the can market requires the development of alloys and application of coatings that must pass stringent customer qualifications and be compliant with Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulations. Our experienced and dedicated research and development team, combined with our Customer Service group, coordinate with coating suppliers, manufacturing operations and our customers to create these alloy and coating systems.
 Research and Development
 Our products are differentiated based on the metallurgy and physical properties of the metal and special characteristics that are required for particular end uses. A significant amount of our research and development is devoted to product and process development within our production operations, and is largely focused on controlling the manufacturing process to improve product quality, ensure consistency and enhance one or more specific product attributes. This has resulted in the creation and delivery of our highly differentiated KaiserSelect® products.
 We operate four research and development centers. Our Rolling and Heat Treat Center and our Metallurgical Analysis Center are both located at our Trentwood facility. The Rolling and Heat Treat Center has complete hot rolling, cold rolling and heat treat capabilities to simulate, in small lots, processing of flat-rolled products for process and product development on an experimental scale. The Metallurgical Analysis Center consists of a full metallographic laboratory and a scanning electron microscope to support research and development programs as well as respond to plant technical service requests. The third center, our Solidification and Casting Center, is located in Newark, Ohio, and has a developmental casting unit capable of casting billets and ingots for extrusion and rolling experiments. The casting unit is also capable of casting full size billets and ingots for processing on the production extrusion presses and rolling mills. Our fourth center, located in New Kensington, Pennsylvania, is focused on the forming and coating of our packaging products and has the capability on laboratory-scaled equipment to produce beverage end and food cans enabling the evaluation of new coatings and processes for packaging products. In addition, our packaging research and development center utilizes a scanning electron microscope along with FDA analytical tools to provide technical expertise to our Warrick facility and our packaging customers.
 Our Imperial Machine & Tool Co. (“IMT”) subsidiary, located in Columbia, New Jersey, provides us with significant technology and intellectual property that complements our metallurgical and application engineering expertise to further advance our capability to deliver highly engineered solutions for our customers. IMT’s multi-material expertise in aluminum, titanium, tantalum, molybdenum, nickel alloys, tungsten, cobalt chromium and stainless steel offers a differentiated approach by combining traditional machining know-how and related technical capabilities with additive manufacturing expertise to drive innovative solutions over the longer term.
 We hold numerous patents, trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights that relate to the design, use and marketing of products. We consider this intellectual property to be important, but no single property is material to the overall conduct of our business.
 Resources
 Manufacturing Processes
 We use two main processes, flat rolling and extrusion/drawing, to produce our fabricated products using a cast of alloyed prime and recycled aluminum in the desired forms and dimensions and with the desired physical properties. Both processes start by heating an aluminum rolling ingot or extrusion billet to an elevated temperature at which the metal is malleable and then applying pressure in 
 7


a manner that both forces the metal into a desired shape and begins the “working” of the metal to enhance its strength and related properties.
 Flat Rolling. Our manufacturing process for aluminum flat-rolled products uses ingot, a large rectangular slab of aluminum, as the starter material. The ingot is processed through a series of rolling operations that can be done at elevated (hot) or room (cold) temperatures. Finishing steps may include heat treatment, annealing, stretching, leveling, coating and slitting to achieve the desired metallurgical, dimensional and/or performance characteristics. Aluminum flat-rolled products are manufactured in a variety of alloys, a range of tempers (hardness), gauges (thickness) and widths and various finishes. Flat-rolled aluminum semi‑finished products are classified as plate (0.250 inches or greater in thickness), sheet (0.249 inches down to 0.008 inches in thickness) or coil (0.249 inches down to 0.001 inches in thickness).
 Extrusion/Drawing. Our extrusion process begins with a cast billet, which is an aluminum cylinder of varying length and diameter cut from a cast log. After heating the billet to make the metal malleable, it is placed into an extrusion press and squeezed (extruded) through a die that gives the material the desired two-dimensional cross section. The material can be quenched as it leaves the press, or processed through a post-extrusion heat treatment cycle, to control the material’s physical properties. The extrusion is straightened, typically by stretching, and then cut to length before being hardened in aging ovens. Drawing is a fabrication operation in which extruded tubes and rods are pulled through a die, or drawn. The primary purpose of drawing is to reduce the diameter and wall thickness while improving physical properties and dimensions. Material may go through multiple drawing steps to achieve the final dimensional specifications. Extruded and drawn semi-fabricated products are manufactured in a variety of alloys and a range of tempers.
 Additionally, some of our locations have remelt and casting operations to produce the ingot or log for flat rolling or extrusion. To produce the ingot or log, we purchase primary aluminum, recycled scrap aluminum segregated by alloys and other metals (including copper, zinc and magnesium) that are necessary to create various aluminum alloys. We also recycle internally generated scrap from our own manufacturing processes. Initially in solid form, aluminum is heated in a vessel to a temperature at which it melts. While in molten form, additional metals (aluminum alloyed scrap, alloy metals, primary aluminum or high purity aluminum) are introduced to achieve the proper mixture of chemical elements for a particular alloy. When the desired chemical composition of the molten metal has been achieved, it is poured through a mold in which the molten metal cools in a controlled manner and solidifies into a rolling ingot or extrusion log. The size of the mold determines the dimensions of the rolling ingot or extrusion log. Our casting operations at our facilities in Kalamazoo, Michigan; London, Ontario; Los Angeles, California; Newark, Ohio and Sherman, Texas produce extrusion log and cut billet for their operations and for our other facilities that do not have casting operations. Our Trentwood and Warrick facilities cast rolling ingot for their own consumption.
 IMT is a leader in advanced manufacturing methods and techniques, which include multi-axis CNC machining, 3D Printing, welding and fabrication for aerospace and defense, automotive, high tech and general industrial applications.
 Many of our facilities employ the same basic manufacturing process and produce the same types of products. We make a significant effort to tightly integrate the management of our multiple manufacturing locations, product lines and end market applications to most efficiently and effectively serve the needs of our customers. We centralize purchasing of our primary and scrap, or recycled, aluminum requirements and related alloying agents in order to better manage price, credit and other benefits. We believe that integration of our operations allows us to capture efficiencies while allowing our facilities to remain highly focused on their specific processes and end market applications.
 Raw Materials
 To make our fabricated products, we purchase primary aluminum and scrap, or recycled, aluminum from third-party suppliers in varying percentages depending on various market factors, including price and availability. The price we pay for primary aluminum is typically based on the average Midwest Transaction Price (“Midwest Price”), which reflects the primary aluminum supply/demand dynamics in North America. The average Midwest Price is comprised of the average London Metal Exchange (“LME”) plus average Midwest premium. The average LME and the average Midwest premium for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $1.12 + $0.26, $0.77 + $0.12 and $0.81 + $0.18, respectively. Scrap aluminum is typically purchased at a discount to the Midwest Price but can require additional processing.
 In addition to selling fabricated aluminum products to third parties, certain of our production facilities supply log, billet or other intermediate material to certain of our other facilities for further value added production. As examples, our London, Ontario facility supplies billet to our Richmond, Virginia facility, and our Newark, Ohio facility supplies log and billet to our Jackson, Tennessee facility.
 8


Suppliers
 We purchase raw materials from a wide array of vendors. In most instances, we have multiple vendors of raw materials to mitigate the risk of an interruption of supply should one of them underperform or discontinue operations. A number of our input materials are commodities, which are subject to market price fluctuations, which we strive to mitigate with our metal price neutrality and hedging programs. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for information about our significant concentrations. 
Pricing, Metal Price Risk Management and Hedging
 As noted above, we purchase primary and scrap, or recycled, aluminum, our principal raw material, on a floating price basis typically based on the average Midwest Price. Our pricing of fabricated aluminum products is generally intended to lock in a conversion margin (representing the value added from the fabrication process(es)) and to pass aluminum and alloy price fluctuations through to our customers. In order to meet our objective to be metal price neutral, we manage the risk of fluctuations in the price of aluminum through our pricing policies and use of financial derivatives. Our three principal pricing mechanisms are as follows:

• | Spot price. A majority of our customers for GE products and some of our customers for Aero/HS products pay a product price that incorporates the spot price of primary aluminum (Midwest Price) in effect at the time of shipment to a customer. Spot prices for these products change regularly based on competitive dynamics. Fluctuation in the underlying aluminum price is a significant factor influencing changes in competitive spot prices. Through spot pricing, we generally can pass aluminum price risk through to customers. For some of our higher value added revenue products sold on a spot basis, however, the pass through of aluminum price movements can lag by several months (the timing of which depends in part on market conditions), with a favorable impact to us when aluminum prices decline and an adverse impact to us when aluminum prices increase. We, from time to time, enter into hedging transactions with third parties to minimize the impact to us of aluminum price swings for these higher value added revenue products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Index-based price. The pricing structure of our typical automotive and aerospace contracts calls for our customer to pay a product price that incorporates a monthly index-based price for primary aluminum, such as the average Midwest Price for primary aluminum. Index-based pricing typically allows us to pass aluminum price risk through to the customer and applies to virtually all of our Automotive Extrusions sales and the majority of our Aero/HS products and Packaging sales.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Firm-price. Some of our customers who commit to volumes and timing of delivery pay a firm-price, creating aluminum price risk that we must hedge. We are able to limit exposure to aluminum price risks created by firm-price customer sales contracts by using third-party hedging instruments. Total fabricated product shipments for which we were subject to price risk were, in millions of pounds, 187.2, 127.6 and 182.4 during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to the aluminum pricing mechanisms described above, we also strive to pass through the cost of alloys through either pricing adders or surcharge mechanisms. In some cases, the passing through of this alloy cost can lag the actual alloy cost by several months, the timing of which is dependent on market conditions and customer agreements, with a favorable impact to us when alloy price declines and an adverse impact to us when alloy price increases. As with aluminum, we, from time to time, enter into either hedging transactions with third parties or firm price physical contracts to minimize the impact to us of alloy price fluctuations.
 All metal procurement and hedging activities are managed centrally to minimize transaction costs, monitor consolidated net exposures and respond promptly to changes in market factors. Hedging activities are conducted in compliance with a policy approved by our Board of Directors and administered by our hedging committee (members of which include our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer).
 Seasonality
 Under normal operating and economic conditions, we generally have immaterial fluctuations in our overall portfolio quarter‑over‑quarter results. Within our individual end markets, our Packaging shipments are generally weighted towards the second half of the year as compared to the first half while our Aero/HS products, Automotive Extrusions and GE products shipments are generally weighted slightly more toward the first half of the year as compared to the second half. This fluctuation in shipments is usually driven by lower demand during summer vacation and year-end holiday shut downs and year-end inventory rebalancing by our end customers. During these periods of lower demand we generally perform planned major maintenance at our facilities, which can affect cost and operating results. 
Government Regulation
 Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local employment, import/export, reporting, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. While we are subject to a wide variety of government regulations, generally those most impactful to our 
 9


results of operations and capital expenditures are the environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of hazardous materials and pollutants and establish standards for the handling, transportation, distribution, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and solid and hazardous wastes. These regulations may require the investigation, assessment, cleanup or monitoring of, or compensation for, environmental impacts, including natural resource damages. We continually monitor our operations with respect to potential environmental issues, including changes in legal requirements and remediation technologies. We have established procedures for regularly evaluating environmental loss contingencies. Our environmental accruals represent our undiscounted estimate of costs reasonably expected to be incurred based on presently enacted laws and regulations, existing requirements, currently available facts, existing technology and our assessment of the likely remediation actions to be taken. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“USEPA”) issued an Endangerment Finding under the Clean Air Act, determining that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and four other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations. We have invested and continue to invest in our manufacturing operations in order to minimize our GHG emissions. The GHG intensity of our products is minimized through: (i) increasing manufacturing efficiencies; (ii) using clean and reliable energy; (iii) using recycled and run-around scrap; and (iv) purchasing low carbon prime. 
 Government Contracts
 We are one of the few remaining United States based aluminum semi-fabricated producers that supply the American defense industry. Although our products are used in a wide variety of military applications, including military aircraft, armored vehicles and ordnance, these products are typically sourced from us by a number of service centers and machine shops that are suppliers to the defense industry. As we generally sell to the chain of suppliers who either subcontract with direct contractors or directly contract with the government, we do not have significant direct government agreements.
Human Capital
 At December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 3,957 people, of which approximately 3,887 were employed in our manufacturing, sales and support office locations and approximately 70 were employed in our corporate office in Foothill Ranch, California. 
Governance and Culture
 Our talented workforce is a key factor underlying our success. We strive to be the employer of choice by providing equal employment and a non‑discriminatory workplace, protecting the health and safety of our employees, providing training programs and maintaining a positive and constructive relationship with labor unions of which our employees are members. Our values support and serve as the foundation for our strategic initiatives and are intended to reflect the company’s “tone at the top” which we believe sustains our culture; a culture that continues to drive our behavior. Additionally, the goal of being a valued corporate citizen guides our environmental, social and governance decisions. We are, as a result, committed to being socially responsible and active members of our industry and the communities in which we operate and our employees and their families live.
 Consistent with our corporate values, we promote fair business practices and a culture of accountability, responsibility and ethical behavior through:
  
• | strong emphasis on the importance of integrity and competence;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | conducting annual governance surveys to assess our culture and the effectiveness of our training;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adopting and enforcing our policies, including Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Human Rights Policy and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy and compliance with applicable laws and regulations; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | encouraging the reporting of illegal or unethical behavior, including the use of In-Touch, a third party compliance feedback program.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe respecting human rights is a fundamental part of our values and corporate responsibility. We strive to respect and promote human rights in our relationships with our employees, suppliers, customers and stakeholders and are guided by the principles of the International Bill of Human Rights (the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two international covenants) and the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Our Human Rights Policy is communicated to our employees as part of their annual code of conduct training, and we expect our employees to uphold this policy.

 We are committed to diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging and strive to be the preferred employer by, among other things: (i) attracting, developing and retaining people from all cultures and segments of the population based on ability; (ii) treating all employees with dignity and respect; (iii) providing an environment of diversity, inclusion, belonging, empowerment, responsibility and accountability; and (iv) offering competitive and equal pay and benefits that attract and retain employees. We focus on: (i) continuing to consider ethnic and gender diversity as we identify training cohorts and opportunities; (ii) leveraging the views and perspectives of our diverse employees and leaders; (iii) developing meaningful metrics and benchmarks by location and job function to measure the effectiveness of our efforts; (iv) fostering relationships with educational institutions, employment agencies and professional groups to expand the pool of potential candidates and employees to achieve a more diverse workforce; (v) focusing on diverse candidates for internships, entry-level positions and scholarships; and (vi) actively recruiting from military bases for military and veteran hiring. In 2021, we enhanced our Human Rights Policy and formalized our diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (“DEIB”) efforts by adopting a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy, which align with our corporate values and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and is overseen by our Board of Directors and senior leadership team.
Labor Practices and Policies
 Safety. We believe employee safety begins with a strong and consistent tone at the top through our executive leadership with oversight provided by our Corporate Health and Safety team, led by our Chief Legal and Compliance Officer. To help us achieve and maintain a strong safety culture, we have robust compliance and assessment programs such as annual safety planning, monthly safety calls, routine performance reviews against targets and routine audits. Additionally, we partner with the United Steelworkers and various industry groups, including the Aluminum Association, to share and identify best practices. We use both internal and external resources, including the American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”) and International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”), to assess our compliance with regulatory and internal standards, providing training, performing risk assessments, audits and loss control inspections and developing mitigation strategies with particular emphasis on risks with a greater potential for severe injury. We stress risk awareness and job safe practices and engage our employees in conversations about safety and safety training using a variety of communication channels, including one-on-one communications. 
 We also believe that having a culture of health and safety involves every employee at every level throughout the organization assuming responsibility to guard against workplace injuries by recognizing risks and taking other actions to minimize injury risk and severity. Risk reduction is a key initiative at each of our facilities and part of our annual planning process and we are committed to nurturing a culture consistent with being a preferred employer. We monitor our progress through routine reviews of our safety process and performance. We utilize both leading and trailing indicators to monitor our progress. While trailing indicators, such as total case incident rate (“TCIR”), lost- time case incident rate (“LTIR”) and days away, restricted and transfer (“DART”) rate, help us monitor our safety performance, leading indicators, such as significant injury and fatality (“SIF”) potential and actual incident rate, near-misses, timely correction action of internal and external audit findings, on-time safety plan execution information and safety culture risk, help us monitor and assess risks and the effectiveness of our safety plans and processes. Plant safety metrics are integrated into our monthly quality, production and financial reports and are reviewed by the senior leadership team every month. In addition, TCIR and LTIR safety modifiers are included in each of our short-term incentive compensation plans, including the corporate plan applicable to each of our executive officers and members of senior management.
 Health. Over the years, we have implemented programs on a Company-wide basis to increase awareness of the importance of employee wellness. We have continued to introduce programs to educate and assist employees to make healthy lifestyle choices and have offered incentives and discounts to encourage participation across the organization, including:

• | annual onsite health biometric screenings;

Labor Union Affiliations. We believe in freedom of association and respect our employees’ choice to be represented or not represented, by a union in accordance with the laws of the states and countries where we operate, without fear of reprisal, intimidation or harassment. Approximately 66% of our employees are represented by labor unions under labor contracts with varying durations and expiration dates. The following table shows each manufacturing location, the primary union affiliation, if any, and the expiration date for the current union contracts as of December 31, 2021. As indicated in the table, union affiliations are with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC (“USW”), International Association of Machinists (“IAM”) and International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“Teamsters”). See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information about concentration of labor subject to collective bargaining agreements.

Recruiting, Training, Development and Retention
 Recruiting. We are committed to recruiting a workforce that reflects people from all cultures and segments of the population based on ability. Our initiatives, which go beyond legal compliance, include: (i) identifying and recruiting diverse talent, including military veterans; (ii) fostering relationships with universities, employment agencies and professional groups that work with more diverse populations; (iii) leveraging inclusive job-posting sites; and (iv) concentrating on diverse candidates for internships, entry‑level positions and scholarships. We have a well-established talent review process that includes operations and functional leaders that are key in the early identification of high performing and high potential employees. We also track and review the gender and ethnic diversity of job applicants and new hires to evaluate the diversity of our organization. The ESG committee of our board oversees, among other things, the succession planning for our executive officers and the leadership, progression and development of key employees. 
 Training, Development and Retention. Kaiser Aluminum is committed to the development of our employees through a broad mix of internal and external program resources incorporating on-the-job training and development through the Kaiser Leadership Program, the Front Line Leader Development Program, Kaiser University, the Tuition Assistance Program, the Metallurgy Excellence and Technical Strength Program. We continue to expand our talent management initiatives to pursue the significant long-term potential for our continued success. Our success is dependent on the knowledge, skills and abilities of our current and future leaders.
 The Kaiser Leadership Program is a full year program that accelerates the readiness of key talent and combines personalized leadership development and Kaiser-management system focused curriculum with a unique opportunity to build relationships with an internal network of leaders across locations and functions. The mission of the Kaiser Leadership Program is to strengthen performance, develop bench strength and accelerate the readiness of key talent across our company. The program blends classroom, online modules and live web events using a cohort model to deliver a flexible, convenient learning environment and includes training and coaching conducted by Thayer Leadership at West Point.
 The Front Line Leader Development Program is a six-month program that strengthens organizational performance through ethical, effective and sustaining tactical leadership for both new and experienced frontline supervisors. The program uses a cohort model to encourage collaboration and team-building and to ensure accountability, facilitated group discussions and effective best practice sharing.

Kaiser University is our web-based learning and development platform offering a catalog of thousands of on-demand courses to employees across a broad range of topics including compliance, maintenance, health and safety, Lean Six Sigma, communication skills, business skills, computer skills, cybersecurity, discrimination and harassment prevention and our processes and policies.
 The Metallurgy Excellence and Technical Strength Program provides professional development for our talented metallurgical professionals in order to facilitate their ability to develop and implement process control systems and identify new technologies that can benefit the company. This program provides mentorship opportunities with company leaders and experts as well as participation in career enhancing training to ensure our competitive advantage.
 The Tuition Assistance Program provides tuition reimbursement for salaried employees and certain represented employees as stipulated by the collective bargaining agreement. The mission of this program is to support our workforce in completing a degree that benefits both our employees and our company.
 Rewards
 All of our employees, including hourly and salaried employees at our production facilities, participate in short-term incentive compensation plans, which are based on attainment of performance metrics that drive and support our best-in-class commitment. We also provide stock-based compensation to executive officers, members of senior management throughout the company and other key employees, as well as a deferred compensation plan for certain employees. All of our U.S. employees have access to 401(k) savings plans and salaried employees at our London, Ontario facility have access to a defined benefit pension plan with annual contributions based on each salaried employee’s age and years of service. Through the collective bargaining process, we contribute to four multi‑employer pension plans under the terms of certain collective bargaining agreements for a majority of our union-represented employees and certain union employees at our Warrick facility participate in a defined benefit pension plan, as well as a postretirement benefit plan relating to retiree medical and life insurance benefits. Additionally, certain hourly and salaried employees are also able to receive defined post-retirement health and welfare benefits through Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Associations.
Information Security
 We employ information systems to support our business. As is the case for other manufacturing companies of comparable size and scope, we, from time to time, experience attempted cyber-attacks on our information system. We also face risks associated with other potential significant failures or disruptions of our information technology networks. We utilize a risk-based, multi-layered information security approach following the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework and have adopted and implemented an approach to identify and mitigate information security risks that we believe is commercially reasonable for manufacturing companies of our size and scope, including many of the best practices of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. 
 Our information security performance and recent cybersecurity industry trends are reviewed by management, including our Chief Information Officer at least monthly and are reported to and reviewed by each of the audit committee and the full board of directors throughout the year (but no less than once a year). Our entire board of directors is responsible for overseeing management’s risk assessment and risk management processes designed to monitor and mitigate information security risks, including cyber risk and related insurance policies.
 We regularly engage independent third parties to test our information security processes and systems as part of our overall enterprise risk management. We also conduct annual information security training to ensure employees are aware of information security risks and to enable them to take steps to mitigate those risks. As part of this program, we also take reasonable steps to ensure our executive management and employees, including any employee who may come into possession of confidential financial information, receive appropriate information security awareness training.
 To date, no attempted cyber-attack or other attempted intrusion on our information technology networks has resulted in a material adverse impact on our operations or financial results, or in any penalties or settlements. In the event an attack or other intrusion were to be successful, we have a response team of internal and external resources engaged and prepared to respond.
