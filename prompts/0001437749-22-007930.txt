Overview
 
BIO-key International, Inc. (the “Company,” “BIO-key,” “we,” or “us”) is a leading identity and access management (IAM) platform provider enabling secure work-from-anywhere for enterprise, education, and government customers.  Our vision is to enable any organization to secure streamlined and passwordless workforce, customer, citizen and student access to any online service, workstation, or mobile application, without a requirement to use tokens or phones.  Our products include PortalGuard® and PortalGuard Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) enterprise IAM, WEB-key® biometric civil and large-scale ID infrastructure, and high-quality, low-cost accessory hardware to provide a full and complete solution for identity-innovating customers.
 
BIO-key PortalGuard empowers organizations to maximize the power of cloud, mobile and web technologies by securing users’ identities and connecting them with the applications they rely on, while keeping cyber-intruders and unauthorized delegates (proxy) out.
 
Millions of users trust BIO-key® to secure access to a variety of cloud, mobile and web applications, on-premise and cloud-based hypervisor servers from all of their devices. Employees and contractors sign into BIO-key PortalGuard to seamlessly and securely access the applications of need to do their work, and customers sign into BIO-key PortalGuard to access online services.  Organizations use PortalGuard to securely collaborate and communicate with their partners and to provide their customers with flexible, resilient user experiences online and while using mobile devices.
 
BIO-key’s WEB-key is a scalable biometric service management platform, incorporating key functions for regulatory compliance, enrollment, authentication or identification, and integrity in a multi-tenant private or public cloud delivery platform.  Government agencies use BIO-key for their large-scale civil ID projects, because WEB-key underpins a biometric identity ecosystem, is cloud-ready, and provides a scalable, high-integrity trust platform which can be operated anywhere and supports over 30 fingerprint scanners interchangeably.
 
We also deliver biometric software integration application programming interfaces, or APIs, allowing software developers to leverage our platform to securely and efficiently embed biometric multi-factor authentication, or MFA, into their own products.  This allows software developers to focus on their core functionality while BIO-key ensures users enter the application without requiring they carry their phone or any token.
 
Even the most security-focused organizations are suffering breaches as a result of human error or improper conduct. As enterprises scale the number of software as a service, or SaaS applications, and multi-cloud services they rely on and the interconnections between them increase, assured identity has emerged as a critical component of an organization’s security framework, directly affecting each triad of cybersecurity – confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  As access perimeters dissolve, organizations must evolve from network-based security models to Zero Trust and Continuous Authentication and Risk Trust Assessment (CARTA) security models, focusing on adaptive and context-aware controls.  True server-secured biometric verification removes the human nature vulnerability at the root of many security compromises creating a more reliable means to manage user access and protect digital assets against rogue users willing to hand over their credentials to a proxy.  Our global identity as a service, or IDaaS, hosting capability allows our customers to simplify and efficiently scale their security infrastructures across internal IT systems and external customer facing applications without installation overhead, security or uptime management efforts.
 
We designed BIO-key PortalGuard IDaaS and WEB-key to provide organizations an integrated approach to managing and securing all of their identities using the technologies they already use while providing capacity for future needs through the strategic use of biometrics to limit vulnerability and contain authentication costs.  Our platform allows users to authenticate their customers, employees, contractors, and partners. It enables any user to connect to any device, cloud or application, all with a simple, customizable, intuitive and consumer-friendly user experience.  We utilize server-secured biometrics to support roving users without requiring them to carry their phone or a token. As of December 31, 2021, more than 300 customers across multiple industries use BIO-key to secure and manage access for users around the world.

BIO-key PortalGuard and PortalGuard IDaaS 
 
BIO-key PortalGuard is an independent, customer-controlled and neutral-by-design cloud-based identity platform that allows our customers to integrate with any cloud or on-premise SaaS application, service or cloud host, as well as Windows device authentication through a single secure, reliable and scalable IAM platform.  It provides identical capabilities in both a SaaS (PortalGuard IDaaS) or on-premise (PortalGuard) delivery model. PortalGuard integrates BIO-key’s Identity Bound Biometric biometric (IBB) authentication as a first-class authentication options that are not tied to a device or “what you have” authentication, allowing relying parties to positively identify who is accessing their systems, not the device they might have handed off.   Our three-way IAM neutrality consists of:

● | seventeen MFA authentication factor choices, including our server-secured IBB, via fingerprint scanners, or using a palm scan, facial selfie, or voice biometric via a mobile phone.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | open user directory choices including on premise, hybrid or full-Azure Active Directory, LDAP, IBM Domino, or custom SQL user directory; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | multiple single sign on, or SSO, federation options, including SAML, OIDC, CAS and WS-Fed.

Other markets for scalable biometric engines include government markets, large scale identity projects such as voter’s registration, driver’s license, national ID programs, and SIM card registration.
 
We also offer a full line of easy to use finger scanners for both enterprise and consumer markets.  Our SideSwipe®, EcoID® and SidePass® finger readers can be used on any laptop, tablet or other device which contains a USB A or C port. We market and sell these fingerprint scanners through distributors and directly to end users via Amazon.
 
Impact of COVID-19
 
The COVID-19 outbreak has led us to migrate to a remote business model for our sales, marketing, administrative and executive teams.  Research and development and production have adjusting to the situation to maintain production as best as possible considering the conditions and regulations.  Our transition to remote work was highly successful, and our teams operated efficiently using our own IAM software to authenticate video conferencing applications and other collaboration tools.  The COVID-19 pandemic has extended sales cycles and delayed deployments in most markets in which we operate, particularly in Africa.  We continue to conduct business daily, some still from home, and others in office occasionally, as we are actively closing transactions throughout the continuing climate, with no changes to personnel.
 
Markets
 
Identity and Access Management, User Multi-Factor Authentication, Single Sign On, Privilege Entitlement and Access Control
 
Our products simplify the authentication process for enterprise users and consumers, while raising security levels. This allows our customers to meet new, stronger authentication requirements and security best practices across many industries, while delivering a superior end-user experience. Customers use our products to reduce risk of theft, fraud, loss, account takeover attacks, and unauthorized account sharing by limiting access to valuable assets, privileges, data, services, networks and places to only authorized individuals. Our products provide stronger identity binding and a superior user experience versus traditional credentialing systems, which utilize a physical or knowledge-based electronic credential to authenticate the holder but fail to authenticate the actual user in addition to the token. Both commercial enterprises and the public sector have seen a shift in the requirement for stronger authentication, and the FBI, NIST and industry thought leaders such as SalesForce and Microsoft have encouraged entities to enhance their security posture by implementing stronger 2-factor authentication (2FA) or MFA. We believe the market for advanced user MFA, including fingerprint biometrics, extends to nearly every industry segment and the market opportunity for our products is massive, global and growing. 
 
Historically, our largest market has been identity and access management for highly regulated industries like government and healthcare. However, we are witnessing a change in the landscape as organizations within all industries and of all sizes are embracing biometric technology and MFA as a security and workflow solution. Championed by the millions of users that have been successfully introduced to biometrics by companies such as Apple and Samsung, today’s users have witnessed the security and convenience benefits of biometric technology in their phones and welcome the same user experience to access applications without passwords.
 
More recently, in connection with the acquisition of PistolStar we have developed a large customer base in the higher education vertical. Colleges and universities throughout the United States use our PortalGuard single sign on platform. As colleges and universities continue to operate in remote environments, we have seen additional demand for our solutions.
 
Upon introducing a series of compact fingerprint readers, we saw an immediate increase in inquiries from both commercial companies seeking an alternative to passwords, and from consumers recognizing that they could use SidePass, SideSwipe or EcoID to replace their Windows passwords and enable Windows Hello without replacing or upgrading laptops or tablets.

Business Model 
 
Our business model is focused on the following key areas:
 

Market Drivers | Frequent announcements of supply chain breaches, ransomware attacks, and administrative access compromises highlight the shortcomings of mainstream MFA and security approaches, which leave far too much responsibility on end-users to comply with cyber-hygiene policies. BIO-key’s biometric authentication process prevents human error and human nature from undermining secure authentication, while making the end user’s access easier than ever. The current climate of broad enterprise adoption of MFA to replace passwords presents opportunities for us to leverage our unique differentiators and exploit the gaps in existing IAM technology approaches. One of those gaps is the challenge of authenticating users that “rove” among workstations. A second gap is preventing unauthorized account sharing and delegation.

OEM Customers | We will continue to prioritize securing agreements with OEM customers. The history of success supporting NCR, McKesson, Omnicell, and LexisNexis provides an established footprint that we intend to build upon. As OEM customers embed our solutions within their products, the customer benefits from the enhanced security and workflow, and frees them from investing in R&D to manage an IAM infrastructure of their own. OEM customers’ ordering patterns are more predictable and OEM customers generally require lower service and support resourcing.

In future periods our R&D efforts will remain focused on updating and advancing our core software products including PortalGuard and PortalGuard IDaaS, MobileAuth, WEB-key and VST. These products are critical to support the anticipated growth in enterprise IAM and large-scale ID projects.
 
Competition 
 
The IAM MFA and SSO market has many providers of solutions in either standalone or IAM suite delivery models. We believe that our unique differentiator in this market is the incorporation of an unparalleled server-secured biometric authentication capability among our 17 authentication factors. There are numerous companies involved in the development, manufacturing and marketing of fingerprint biometrics products to commercial, government, law enforcement and prison markets. These companies include, but are not limited to, IDEMIA, Thales, NEC, Neurotechnology, and Innovatrics.
 
The majority of sales for automated fingerprint identification products in the market to date have been deployed for government agencies, healthcare facilities, and law enforcement applications. The consumer and commercial markets represent areas of growth potential for biometrics, led by the use of mobile devices.
 
The epidemic of security and data breaches reported over the past few years is one of the driving factors for identifying new methods of protecting valuable data. After attempting to create a more sophisticated password, or more efficient token or PIN, it has become apparent that each of these methods are easily compromised, and the downside risks are significant.
 
    7 

  

We have also seen FIDO-compliant keys enter the market, led by Yubico’s YubiKey, a USB key that acts as a credential for access.  Keys alone do not meet the needs of large organizations for which key sharing and lost keys are concerns.  We have introduced a line of low-cost USB keys and they do not offer the security benefits of biometric technology as they can be easily lost or stolen and replacement costs / managing the product becomes a growing expense.
 
With respect to competing biometrics technologies, each has its strengths and weaknesses and none has emerged as a market leader:
 

● | Fingerprint identification is generally viewed as very accurate, inexpensive and non-intrusive and is the dominant biometric in use today and will be for the foreseeable future;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Palm Vein scanning is expensive, technique-sensitive, and offers mobility challenges;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Iris scanning is viewed as accurate, but the hardware is significantly more expensive; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Facial recognition can have privacy concerns with work-from-home use, and is typically highly dependent on ambient lighting conditions, angle of view, and other factors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Government Regulations
 
Various state, federal and EU privacy laws govern the collection, storage, use and any sale of biometric-related data.  To the extent that BIO-key’s IDaaS offerings include the collection and storage of customer users’ personal or biometric data, we operate as a processor of such data.  Our WEB-key platform includes compliance features to ensure automated compliance with these laws including collection of informed written consent during enrollment workflows and robust auditing to control and report on the retention of biometric data and removal requests.  Additionally, our customers have access to these tools to maintain their own compliance, including deletion of user data when business relationships terminate.
 
We believe in biometric privacy rights, and that both users and their organizations benefit from a responsibly operated biometric identity infrastructure.  We actively participate in industry privacy workgroups as recognized biometric subject matter experts in order to influence and keep abreast of any proposed changes to these regulations. Beyond these regulations, we are not currently subject to direct regulation by any government agency, other than regulations generally applicable to businesses or related to specific project requirements.
