The Company believes the reproducibility of scientific studies has become a substantial issue in life science research from drug discovery and development through trials as researchers throughout the world continue to use different protocols for processes associated with sample preparation, cryopreservation and cold chain management. We believe the scientific community is becoming more aware of factors that affect sample integrity and experimental variability. By standardizing handling, storage, and transportation protocols we can substantially improve the quality and reproducibility of adipose tissue and cell collection, processing, storage and retrieval which will help to accelerate the transition from lab research to therapy development and market launch. To this end, we have licensed affiliates operating on our cellular collection-processing and storage platform in Tokyo, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong, and China.
 
We are generating revenues through the sale and licensing of our patented products, laboratory tools, and services to capitalize on: (1) ADSC technologies; (2) scientific breakthroughs incorporating ADSCs that have been developing in the fast growing Regenerative and Personalized Medicine industries; (3) providing these growth industries with a standardized ADSC cell processing platform; (4) enhancing the delivery of healthcare through cellular-based therapies and applications which address disease treatment, orthopedic injuries, wound and burn healing, and personalized health and beauty care; and (5) building a global network of physicians and affiliated laboratory facilities for the delivery of our products and services.
 
Our proprietary, patented processing platform allows for the collection, preparation and cryo-preservation of adipose tissue without manipulation, bio-generation or the addition of animal-derived products or other chemical materials which require removal from the tissue sample upon retrieval or prior to use. Management believes this core process makes each tissue sample suitable for use in cosmetic grafting procedures or for further processing to adult stem cells for stem cell therapies. Currently, we believe there are numerous therapeutic and orthopedic applications for adipose tissue and adult stem cell treatments in use globally.
 


Products and Services
 
American CryoStem is focused on multiple high margin business lines capable of generating sustainable, recurring revenue streams from each of our developed products and services. The Company incorporates its proprietary and patented or patent pending laboratory products, such as our ACSelerate™ cell culture media, into our processing product production and contract manufacturing services.

To date, we have generated minimal revenue; however, subject to, among other factors, obtaining the requisite financing, management believes that we are well positioned to utilize our developed products and services as the foundation for domestic and international distribution through licensees of our technologies, and a host of Regenerative Medicine application uses and future therapy products. In the US we operate an FDA registered facility that generates revenue from; the processing and storage of adipose tissue (ATGRAFT), the processing of adipose tissue into its cellular components for future use (ATCELL) and the production and sale of our CELLECT® tissue collection boxes, and patented media products.
 
CELLECT® Collection, Transportation, and Storage System – An unbreakable “chain of custody” solution for physicians to collect and deliver tissue samples utilizing proprietary and patent pending methods and materials. The CELLECT® service is monitored in real-time and assures the highest cell viability upon laboratory receipt. The CELLECT® system incorporates our ACSelerate–TR™ transport medium into all collection bags which supports the health of the tissue during transport. The CELLECT® kit is an integral part of our ATGRAFT™ and ATCELL™ technology to be used by all licensees of our technologies. The CELLECT® service is included in our granted patent “Business Method for Collection, Processing, Cryogenic Storage and Distribution of a Biologic Sample Material” US Patent Number 10,014,079, issued July 3, 2018.
 
American CryoStem is the first tissue bank to globally incorporate through its CELLECT® service the International Blood Banking identification, labeling and product identification coding system. The coding was developed in conjunction with the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), the American Red Cross and the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT). These groups form the International Council for Commonality in Blood Banking Automation (ICCBBA) and developed the ISBT 128 Standard for machine readable labeling. This labeling system is an acceptable machine readable labeling standard, product description, and bar coding system for FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research under 21 CFR 606.12(c) 13. American CryoStem conforms to this standard in its laboratory facility and all cellular and tissue products produced at the facility carry our W3750 ICCBBA facility identifier allowing any hospital, clinic, laboratory and regulator worldwide to identify the origin and obtain additional information on any sample produced at an American CryoStem laboratory facility. The Company will promote this standard in all laboratories that license or utilize our technology.
 
ATGRAFT™ Adipose Tissue Storage Service – An adipose tissue (fat) collection, processing and storage solution allowing physicians to provide their patients with multiple tissue products and cell storage options. The ATGRAFT™ service, through one liposuction procedure allows individuals to prepare for multiple future cosmetic or regenerative procedures by using their own stored adipose tissue as a natural biocompatible filler, or the components for multiple cellular therapy application without the trauma of further liposuctions. ATGRAFT™ procedures may include breast reconstruction, layered augmentation, buttocks enhancement or volume corrections of the hands, feet, face and neck areas that experience significant adipose tissue (fat) volume reduction as we age. ATGRAFT™ is processed and stored utilizing our standards so that any stored fat tissue sample may be retrieved in the future and re-processed to create stem cells, “ATCELL™”, for use in Regenerative Medicine applications. The ATGRAFT™ service is included in our granted patent “Business Method for Collection, Processing, Cryogenic Storage and Distribution of a Biologic Sample Material” US Patent Number 10,014,079, issued July 3, 2018.
 
The Company’s charges standardized fees for ATGRAFT™ tissue processing and minimum annual storage fees depending on the volume of tissue processed. These processing and storage fees may be paid by the collecting/treating physician or the consumer. The Company earns additional fees upon sample retrieval, for the thawing, packaging and shipment of the stored samples to the physician, clinic or “point-of-care” for immediate use upon receipt. Additionally, physicians may request that any stored ATGRAFT™ tissue sample of 25ml or greater be reprocessed utilizing the Company’s ATCELL™ and Autokine-CM™ processing to create therapy or cosmetic products, on-demand.
 
The Company believes the ATGRAFT™ service creates patient retention and significant revenue opportunities for the participating physician. The ATGRAFT™ service lowers physician overall costs related to tissue transfer services and multiple therapy applications by eliminating the cost of additional liposuction(s) procedures for each scheduled fat transfer or therapy procedure. Physician cost savings may include: materials, supplies, equipment, and the expenses of utilizing a surgical center, hospital operating room or an in-office aseptic procedure room. The ATGRAFT™ service is designed to operate under the minimally manipulated regulations contained in both 21 CFR 1271.10 and PHS 361.

ATCELL™ Adipose Derived Stem Cells (ADSCs) – Processed and characterized adipose derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) created using the Company’s proprietary Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and ACSelerate™ patented cell culture media. ATCELL™ is the Company’s trademarked name for its ADRCs and differentiated cell products and processing methodology. The Company maintains for research purposes multiple master and differentiated cell lines and labels them according to their characterization, ie. ATCELL™ (adipose derived stem cells), ATCELL-SVF™ (stromal vascular fraction), ATCELL – CH™ (differentiated chondrocytes), etc. Cell lines may be custom created for patients desiring to store their cells for their own future use in Regenerative Medicine procedures. The Company charges its customers a fee to reprocess previously stored ATGRAFT™ (pure fat) samples and for newly collected client tissue samples to be processed into cellular samples. Customer samples are processed utilizing the CELLECT® collection system and ACSelerate™ mediums to conform to our internal SOPs and quality control standards.
 
Additionally, the Company believes it will earn additional fees based upon the proposed storage configuration of the final ATCELL™ sample, and for future product creation by culturing additional samples in the ACSelerate™ cell culture and differentiation media. Cell culturing and differentiation can be performed upon receipt of the raw tissue sample or at any time on a previously processed and cryopreserved ATGRAFT™ or ATCELL™ sample. ATCELL™ has shown that it is ideally suited for expansion and differentiation into additional cell types utilizing the ACSelerate™ line of culture and differentiation mediums. The ATCELL™ processing, products and services are incorporated into our granted patent “Systems and Methods for the Digestion of Adipose Tissue Samples Obtained from a Client for Cryopreservation” US 10,154,664 issued December 18, 2018, and “Business Method for Collection, Processing, Cryogenic Storage and Distribution of a Biologic Sample Material” US Patent Number 10,014,079, issued July 3, 2018. The ACSelerate Medium products are incorporated into our granted patents “Cell Culture Media, Kits and Methods of Use”, US Patent No. 7,989,205 issued August 2, 2011 with additional claims granted in US Patent No. 9,487,755 granted November 8,20146.
 
The Company’s ATCELL™ cell lines are processed and cultured in our patented ACSelerate™ cell culture media. All CRYO processed samples; tissue, cells, and research materials made available for therapies, tissue transfer or sale to research institutions are tested for sterility, disease, lifespan, and population doubling rate (PDL). Additionally, we believe ATCELL™ cells are suited for any type of cellular therapy or regenerative medicine research. Cell morphology is confirmed by (i) flow cytometry and (ii) differentiation analysis using ACSelerate™ differentiation media. Each ATCELL™ line can be further cultured and differentiated allowing the Company to provide genetically matched cell types. We believe this research methodology may provide opportunities for the Company’s ATCELL™ and ACSelerate™ products to become the building blocks of final developed commercial applications.
 
The Company intends to support its cell therapy application research, development and collaborative efforts by making ATCELL™ and ATGRAFT™ samples available for research and product development purposes through joint ventures, and university and commercial collaborations. These adipose tissue and cell line samples, we believe will be sought after by private researchers and universities for use in pre-clinical trial studies and in-vitro research due to our processing methodology, donor sample data, the ability to create multiple cell types that have identical genetic profiles, and achieving repeatable results. We believe the processing methods, data collection and testing of our ATCELL™ and the ability to make multiple cell types from the same donor line allows research teams the ability to focus on application development and avoid bench to commercialization delays. The Company is prepared to distribute research samples of its ATCELL™ cell products to users of its ACSelerate™ cell culture media for application development
 
ACSelerate™ Cell Culture Media Products – Manufactured patented cell culture media products for growing human stromal cells (including all cells found in human skin, fat and other connective tissue). Certain of the Company’s ACSelerate™ cell culture media lines are available in animal serum free, which may be suitable for human and therapeutic uses or available in a low serum version for application development and research purposes. The patented ACSelerate™ cell culture media line(s) was specifically developed to address increasing industry demand for animal serum-free cell culture products and for the acceleration of products from the laboratory to the patient.
 
The Company entered into a licensing and manufacturing agreement with PeproTech (April 4, 2016) a life sciences company formed in 1988. PeproTech is the trusted source for the development and manufacturing of high quality cytokine products for the life-science and cell therapy markets.

On August 2, 2011, the Company was issued US patent number 7,989,205 for “Cell Culture Media, Kits and Methods of Use.” The granted claims include media variations for cellular differentiation of ADSCs into osteoblasts (bone), chondrocytes (cartilage), adipocytes (fat), neural cells, and smooth muscles cells in both HSA medium grade and FBS (research) grade. This patent covers both non-GMP research grades and GMP grades suitable for cell culture of adipose-derived stem cells. Additionally, on November 8, 2016 the Company was granted additional claims from the continuation U.S. Serial No. 13/194,900 issued as a new Patent Serial No. 9,487,755. Prior to the issuance the Company filed a continuation in part (CIP) containing additional claims related to our ongoing media development.
 
The use of FBS and other animal products in cellular therapy application development and manufacture raises concerns and generates debates within the scientific and regulatory community relating to potential human/animal cross-contamination. These same concerns may lead to additional expensive and expansive testing and documentation requirements with the FDA during the application and approval process for new cellular therapies manufactured with or containing animal or animal derived products. FDA concerns are evidenced in their Guidance’s and Guidelines regarding cellular therapy involving human cells, tissues and products (HCT/Ps) published and maintained by the FDA. Management believes that eliminating or greatly reducing FBS in cellular manufacturing, applications and products can eliminate or ease these scientific and regulatory concerns and may prove to be a winning strategy for cellular therapy application developers seeking FDA approval.
 
The Company supports its marketing efforts by making ATCELL™ samples available for research purposes and for internal product development through our research programs. We believe these cell lines may be sought after by private researchers and universities for use in pre-clinical trial studies and in-vitro research. We also believe that the Company’s ability to provide these materials for these research and development collaborators, partners and other third parties extends the Company’s ability to become a primary source of materials and services necessary to support approved applications and treatments.
 
The Company has created several versions of its ACSelerate™ cell culture media including:

The Company intends to expand its relationships and contract manufacturing regionally through its physician networks and globally through its International Licensing Program.
 
International Licensing Program – The Company believes that, many jurisdictions outside the US currently permit cellular therapies and regenerative medicine applications. The Company has received numerous international inquiries concerning the sale or licensing of our SOPs, products and services in the Regenerative Medicine and Medical Tourism Markets. The Company believes that the inquiries to date are a result of the global boom in Medical Tourism, Regenerative and Personalized Medicine and the slow pace of approval of cellular therapies and regenerative medicine applications in the US. To address the Company’s sales, marketing and branding opportunities globally, the Company has created its international licensing program. To date we have licensed our technologies in Hong Kong, China, Thailand and, Japan.
 
The Company believes it can take advantage of the significant growth of the global cellular therapy market through its international licensing and marketing efforts. A recently published study by Transparency Market Research predicts the global market for stem cells is expected to register a healthy CAGR of 13.8% during the period from 2017 to 2025 to become worth US$270.5 bn by 2025.

In January 2018 the Company expanded its existing facilities and undertook a complete remediation of its laboratory operations in expectation of a pending (IND) filing with the FDA for the use of autologous adipose derived cells for the relief of inflammation associated with certain conditions resulting from trauma. The Company has completed its Pre-IND meeting with FDA to clarify some of the requirements of the IND application process and necessary documentation. The Company leased additional space and is in the final stages of certifying and validating a new Clean Room designed specifically for cellular expansion, medium filling and tissue processing. In addition, the Company has retained consultants to assist its personnel in the review and re-validation of its operating procedures, equipment and processing methods as well as designing new procedures for upgraded and newly acquired laboratory operating and testing equipment. The Company believes that it can complete the laboratory cGMP work to upgrade its facility from a registered tissue bank to a Biologic Drug Manufacturer and submit the IND Application to FDA during Q1-Q2, 2019.
 
The Company’s New Jersey laboratory facility is registered with the FDA (FEI 3008307548) as a processing and storage facility for Human Cells, Tissues and Cellular and Tissue Based Products (HCT/Ps) since 2010. In 2013, we registered the facility with the State of New York (CP169TP136) and the State of California (CNC80948) the only states in the U.S. requiring registration. We have discussed our operations with the State of New Jersey Health Department and Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to ascertain any special regulations to which we may be subject. Based upon these discussions, and our use of a registered medical waste disposal company, we do not at this time have any special registrations or regulations for compliance with the State of New Jersey.
 
Our SOPs are the key to properly operating our tissue processing facility. In 2018 the Company hired a cGMP consultant to assist it with the update of all SOP’s, data collection forms, Quality Control Program and laboratory operations to conform with cGMP in response to the observations made by FDA. To ensure delivery of the highest quality services, we incorporate these SOPs, which are designed to provide a basis for accreditation by the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB) and the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT-JACIE).
 
We have consistently endeavored to ensure that our processes, methodologies and procedures remain among the highest standards in the global tissue collection, processing and storage market. To this end, we have equipped ourselves with state-of-the-art quality processing and testing equipment, which we believe helps to ensure that every sample collected and processed is sterile (free from adventitious agents), viable and capable of significant cellular growth and expansion.

Quality Management
 
The Company’s quality management program attempts to ensure that during processing and testing of each adipose tissue, SVF, or cellular sample, the appropriate quality management tests and processing methodologies are performed and the data is collected, recorded and reviewed by the laboratory management team. In 2018 the Company hired a Quality Control consultant to assist the Company in updating its Quality Control Program, laboratory processes, SOPs, data collection, and laboratory, product and materials validation programs. 
Chain of Custody Control
 
Central to the individual sample testing is an unbroken chain of custody and tracking. Sample tracking begins with the creation of each collection box. All samples, processing, quality management, batch, and storage documents and records, are coded with this unique number. All records and testing samples are cross referenced and verified as required by the standard operating procedures.
Testing Design and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
 
Testing methods are standardized and operate under a complete set of SOPs and Quality Management (QM) processes. All SOPs are designed to be in compliance with the US Food and Drug Administration’s regulations and guidance for aseptic processing. Strict QM is enforced to avoid and/or record any process deviations. In 2018 in response to the Letter received by the Company from the FDA, the Company undertook a major reorganization and upgrade of all of its methods, SOPs, processes and facility to upgrade its facility from a registered tissue bank to a Biologic Drug Manufacturer.
Intellectual Property
 
From the Company’s formation, our strategy has been to invest time and capital in intellectual property protection. This strategy is intended to strengthen our Company’s foundation in any defensive or offensive legal challenge. In addition, we are developing our IP portfolio to ensure and enhance our business flexibility and allow us to gain favorable terms in potential future collaborative partnerships with third parties.
