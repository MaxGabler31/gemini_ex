Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc.
Consolidated Schedule of Investments as of December 31, 2021
(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
 



* | Assets are pledged as collateral for the Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 6 “Debt”. 
(+) | Represents the actual interest rate for partially or fully funded debt in effect as of the reporting date. Variable rate loans bear interest at a rate that may be determined by the larger of the floor or the reference to either LIBOR ("L"), SOFR ("S") or alternate base rate (commonly based on the U.S. Prime Rate ("P"), unless otherwise noted) at the borrower’s option, which reset periodically based on the terms of the credit agreement. L and S loans are typically indexed to 12 month, 6 month, 3 month, 2 month, 1 month or 1 week L or S rates. As of December 31, 2021, rates for the 12 month, 6 month, 3 month, 2 month, 1 month and 1 week L are 0.58%, 0.34%, 0.21%, 0.15%, 0.10% and 0.08%, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, 3 month S was 0.05%, P was 3.25%, and Canadian Prime rate ("CDN P") was 2.45%. For investments with multiple reference rates or alternate base rates, the interest rate shown is the weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2021.
(++) | Par amount is presented for debt investments, while the number of shares or units owned is presented for equity investments. Par amount is denominated in U.S. Dollars ("$") unless otherwise noted, Euro ("€"), Great British Pound (“GBP”), or Canadian dollar ("CAD"). 
# | Percentages are based on net assets. 
^ | As defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), the investment is deemed to be an “affiliated person” of the Company because the Company owns, either directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the portfolio company’s outstanding voting securities. See Note 3 “Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions”. 
^^ | As defined in the Investment Company Act, the investment is deemed to be a “controlled affiliated person” of the Company because the Company owns, either directly or indirectly, 25% or more of the portfolio company’s outstanding voting securities or has the power to exercise control over management or policies of such portfolio company. See Note 3 “Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions”. 
^^^ | The investment is otherwise deemed to be an “affiliated person” of the Company. See Note 3 “Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions”. 
(1) | The investment is not a qualifying asset under Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act. The Company may not acquire any non-qualifying asset unless, at the time of acquisition, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company’s total assets. As of December 31, 2021 the aggregate fair value of these securities is $154,694 or 4.36% of the Company’s total assets. 
(2) | Represent co-investments made with the Company’s affiliates in accordance with the terms of the exemptive relief received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. See Note 3 “Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions”. 
(3) | The fair value of the investment was determined using significant unobservable inputs. See Note 5 “Fair Value Measurement”. 
(4) | Position or portion thereof is an unfunded loan commitment, and no interest is being earned on the unfunded portion. The unfunded loan commitment may be subject to a commitment termination date that may expire prior to the maturity date stated.

Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc.
 Consolidated Schedule of Investments as of December 31, 2020 (continued)
 (in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
 


* | Assets are pledged as collateral for the Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 6 “Debt”. 
(+) | Represents the actual interest rate for partially or fully funded debt in effect as of the reporting date. Variable rate loans bear interest at a rate that may be determined by the larger of the floor or the reference to either LIBOR ("L") or alternate base rate (commonly based on the Prime Rate ("P")), at the borrower’s option, which reset periodically based on the terms of the credit agreement. L loans are typically indexed to 12 month, 6 month, 3 month, 2 month, 1 month or 1 week L rates. As of December 31, 2020, rates for the 12 month, 6 month, 3 month, 2 month, 1 month and 1 week L are 0.34%, 0.26%, 0.24%, 0.19%, 0.14% and 0.10%. As of December 31, 2020, P was 3.25%. For investments with multiple reference rates or alternate base rates, the interest rate shown is the weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2020.
(++) | The total par amount is presented for debt investments, while the number of shares or units owned is presented for equity investments. Par amount is denominated in U.S. Dollars ("$") unless otherwise noted, Euro ("€"). 
# | Percentages are based on net assets. 
^ | As defined in the Investment Company Act, the investment is deemed to be an “affiliated person” of the Company because the Company owns, either directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the portfolio company’s outstanding voting securities. See Note 3 “Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions”. 
^^ | As defined in the Investment Company Act, the investment is deemed to be a “controlled affiliated person” of the Company because the Company owns, either directly or indirectly, 25% or more of the portfolio company’s outstanding voting securities or has the power to exercise control over management or policies of such portfolio company. See Note 3 “Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions”. 
^^^ | The investment is otherwise deemed to be an “affiliated person” of the Company. See Note 3 “Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions”. 
(1) | The investment is not a qualifying asset under Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act. The Company may not acquire any non-qualifying asset unless, at the time of acquisition, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company’s total assets. As of December 31, 2020 the aggregate fair value of these securities is $96,067 or 2.90% of the Company’s total assets. 
(2) | Represent co-investments made with the Company’s affiliates in accordance with the terms of the exemptive relief received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. See Note 3 “Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions”. 
(3) | Position or portion thereof is an unfunded loan commitment, and no interest is being earned on the unfunded portion. The unfunded loan commitment may be subject to a commitment termination date that may expire prior to the maturity date stated. The negative cost, if applicable, is the result of the capitalized discount being greater than the principal amount outstanding on the loan. The negative fair value, if applicable, is the result of the capitalized discount on the loan. See Note 8 "Commitments and Contingencies". 
(4) | The fair value of the investment was determined using significant unobservable inputs. See Note 5 “Fair Value Measurement”. 
(5) | The investment is on non-accrual status. See Note 2 “Significant Accounting Policies”. 
(6) | Non-income producing security. 
(7) | In exchange for the greater risk of loss, the “last-out” portion of the Company's unitranche loan investment generally earns a higher interest rate than the “first-out” portions. The “first-out” portion would generally receive priority with respect to payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder over the “last-out” portion. 
(8) | Securities exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, and may be deemed to be “restricted securities”. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate fair value of these securities is $114,458 or 7.09% of the Company's net assets. The initial acquisition dates have been included for such securities. 

 (9) Right to purchase up to $8,851 of 1st Lien Senior Secured Debt, $7,483 of 2nd Lien Senior Secured Debt and 68,796 shares of Class A Units, which expires November 2021.

On March 29, 2013, the Company elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Effective April 1, 2013, the Company converted from a SMLLC to a Delaware corporation. In addition, the Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2013.
The Company’s investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation primarily through direct originations of secured debt, including first lien debt, unitranche loans, including last-out portions of such loans, and second lien debt, and unsecured debt, including mezzanine debt, as well as through select equity investments.
Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (“GSAM”), a Delaware limited partnership and an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (including its predecessors, “GS & Co.”), is the investment adviser (the “Investment Adviser”) of the Company. The term “Goldman Sachs” refers to Group Inc., together with GS & Co., GSAM and its other subsidiaries.
On March 23, 2015, the Company completed its initial public offering and the Company’s common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “GSBD.”
The Company has formed wholly owned subsidiaries, which are structured as Delaware limited liability companies, to hold certain equity or equity-like investments in portfolio companies.
The Merger with Goldman Sachs Middle Market Lending Corp.
 On October 12, 2020, the Company completed its merger (the “Merger”) with Goldman Sachs Middle Market Lending Corp. (“GS MMLC”) pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of June 11, 2020. In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of GS MMLC common stock was converted into the right to receive, for each share of GS MMLC common stock, that number of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”), with a net asset value (“NAV”) equal to the NAV per share of GS MMLC common stock, in each case calculated as of October 9, 2020. As a result of the Merger, the Company issued an aggregate of 61,037,311 shares of Common Stock to former GS MMLC stockholders. For further information, see Note 13 “Merger with GS MMLC.”
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The Company’s functional currency is U.S. dollars (“USD”) and these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in that currency. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to Regulation S-X. This requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These consolidated financial statements reflect normal and recurring adjustments that in the opinion of the Company are necessary for the fair statement of the results for the periods presented. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions included on the consolidated financial statements.
Certain prior period information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The reclassification has no effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or the consolidated results of operations as previously reported.
 As an investment company, the Company applies the accounting and reporting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 946, Financial Services – Investment Companies (“ASC 946”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”).
Basis of Consolidation
As provided under ASC 946, the Company will not consolidate its investment in a company other than an investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company. Accordingly, the Company consolidated the financial position and results of operations of its wholly owned subsidiaries, BDC Blocker I, LLC (formerly known as My-On BDC Blocker, LLC), GSBD Blocker II, LLC, GSBD Wine I, LLC, GSBD Blocker III, LLC, GSBD Blocker IV, LLC, GSBD Blocker V, LLC, MMLC Blocker I, LLC, MMLC Blocker II, LLC, MMLC Wine I, LLC, and MMLC Blocker III, LLC. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue Recognition
The Company records its investment transactions on a trade date basis, which is the date when the Company assumes the risks for gains and losses related to that instrument. Realized gains and losses are based on the specific identification method.
Interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts and premiums to par value on investments purchased are accreted and amortized into interest income over the life of the respective investment using the effective interest method. Loan origination fees, original issue discount (“OID”) and market discounts or premiums are capitalized and amortized into interest income using the effective interest method or straight-line method, as applicable. Exit fees that are receivable upon repayment of a loan or debt security are amortized into interest income over the life of the respective investment. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income, for which the Company has earned the following:

 | For the Years Ended December 31, | 
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | | 2019
Prepayment premiums | $ | 3,224 | | $ | 1,822 | | $ | 1,925
Accelerated amortization of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts | $ | 54,467 | | $ | 9,494 | | $ | 4,573

 
Fees received from portfolio companies (directors’ fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax advisory fees and other similar compensation) are paid to the Company, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief, if any, therefrom, the Company only receives its allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as another account managed by the Investment Adviser.
Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Interest and dividend income are presented net of withholding tax, if any.
Certain investments may have contractual payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated dividends that are added to the principal amount or shares (if equity) of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon the investment being called by the issuer. PIK is recorded as interest or dividend income, as applicable. If at any point the Company believes PIK is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest or dividend income.
Certain structuring fees, amendment fees, syndication fees and commitment fees are recorded as other income when earned. Administrative agent fees received by the Company are recorded as other income when the services are rendered over time.
Non-Accrual Investments
Investments are placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal, interest or dividends will not be collected according to the contractual terms. Accrued interest or dividends generally are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management’s judgment. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest or dividends are paid and, in management’s judgment, principal and interest or dividend payments are likely to remain current. The Company may make exceptions to this treatment if an investment has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had certain investments held in portfolio companies on non-accrual status, which represented 2.5% and 1.8% of the total investments (excluding investments in money market funds, if any) at amortized cost and at fair value. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had certain investments held in four portfolio companies on non-accrual status, which represented 0.7% and 0.3% of the total investments (excluding investments in money market funds, if any) at amortized cost and at fair value.

Investments
The Company carries its investments in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”), issued by the FASB, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices provided by independent pricing services, broker or dealer quotations or alternative price sources. In the absence of quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations or alternative price sources, investments are measured at fair value as determined by the board of directors (the “Board of Directors”) within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.
Due to the inherent uncertainties of valuation, certain estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been realized had a ready market for these investments existed, and these differences could be material. See Note 5 “Fair Value Measurement”.
The Company generally invests in illiquid securities, including debt and equity investments, of middle-market companies. The Board of Directors has delegated to the Investment Adviser day-to-day responsibility for implementing and maintaining internal controls and procedures related to the valuation of the Company’s portfolio investments. Under valuation procedures adopted by the Board of Directors, market quotations are generally used to assess the value of the investments for which market quotations are readily available. The Investment Adviser obtains these market quotations from independent pricing services or at the bid prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers, if available; otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. To assess the continuing appropriateness of pricing sources and methodologies, the Investment Adviser regularly performs price verification procedures and issues challenges as necessary to independent pricing services or brokers, and any differences are reviewed in accordance with the valuation procedures. If the Board of Directors or Investment Adviser has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quotation does not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investment in accordance with valuation procedures for investments for which market quotations are not readily available.
With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or for which market quotations are deemed not reflective of the fair value, the valuation procedures adopted by the Board of Directors contemplate a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:
(1)The quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser responsible for the portfolio investment; 
 (2)The Board of Directors also engages independent valuation firms (the “Independent Valuation Advisors”) to provide independent valuations of the investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of an investment. The Independent Valuation Advisors independently value such investments using quantitative and qualitative information provided by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser and the portfolio companies as well as any market quotations obtained from independent pricing services, brokers, dealers or market dealers. The Independent Valuation Advisors also provide analyses to support their valuation methodology and calculations. The Independent Valuation Advisors provide an opinion on a final range of values on such investments to the Board of Directors or the Audit Committee. The Independent Valuation Advisors define fair value in accordance with ASC 820 and utilize valuation approaches including the market approach, the income approach or both. A portion of the portfolio is reviewed on a quarterly basis, and all investments in the portfolio for which market quotations are not readily available, or are readily available, but deemed not reflective of the fair value of an investment, are reviewed at least annually by an Independent Valuation Advisor; 
 (3)The Independent Valuation Advisors’ preliminary valuations are reviewed by the Investment Adviser and the Valuation Oversight Group (“VOG”), a team that is part of the Controllers Department within the Finance Division of Goldman Sachs. The Independent Valuation Advisors’ valuation ranges are compared to the Investment Adviser’s valuations to ensure the Investment Adviser’s valuations are reasonable. VOG presents the valuations to the Asset Management Private Investment Valuation and Side Pocket Working Group of the Asset Management Valuation Committee, which is comprised of representatives from GSAM who are independent of the investment decision making process; 
 (4)The Asset Management Valuation Committee ratifies fair valuations and makes recommendations to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors; 
 (5)The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews valuation information provided by the Asset Management Division Valuation Committee, the Investment Adviser and the Independent Valuation Advisors. The Audit Committee then assesses such valuation recommendations; and 
 (6)The Board of Directors discusses the valuations and, within the meaning of the Investment Company Act, determines the fair value of the investments in good faith, based on the inputs of the Investment Adviser, the Independent Valuation Advisors and the Audit Committee. 
 Money Market Funds
Investments in money market funds are valued at NAV per share. See Note 3 “Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions.”
100
 

Cash
Cash consists of deposits held at a custodian bank. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company held an aggregate cash balance of $33,764 and $32,137. Foreign currency of $2,614 and $1,831 (acquisition cost of $2,760 and $1,765) is included in cash as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
Foreign Currency Translation
Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are translated into USD on the following basis: (i) investments and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into USD based upon currency exchange rates effective on the last business day of the period; and (ii) purchases and sales of investments, borrowings and repayments of such borrowings, income, and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into USD based upon currency exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates.
The Company does not isolate the portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations are included within the net realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments. Fluctuations arising from the translation of non-investment assets and liabilities are included with the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on foreign currency translations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Foreign security and currency translations may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies and U.S. government securities. These risks include, but are not limited to, currency fluctuations and revaluations and future adverse political, social and economic developments, which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies or U.S. government securities.
Derivatives
The Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the Company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies. In a foreign currency forward contract, the Company agrees to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of one currency for another, at a pre-determined price at a future date. Forward foreign currency contracts are marked-to-market at the applicable forward rate. Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency forward contracts are recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities by counterparty on a net basis, not taking into account collateral posted which is recorded separately, if applicable. Notional amounts of foreign currency forward contract assets and liabilities are presented separately on the Consolidated Schedules of Investments. Purchases and settlements of foreign currency forward contracts having the same settlement date and counterparty are generally settled net and any realized gains or losses are recognized on the settlement date. The Company does not utilize hedge accounting and as such, the Company recognizes its derivatives at fair value with changes in the net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency forward contracts recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes tax positions in its consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized upon settlement. The Company reports any interest expense related to income tax matters in income tax expense, and any income tax penalties under expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company’s tax positions have been reviewed based on applicable statutes of limitation for tax assessments, which may vary by jurisdiction, and based on such review, the Company has concluded that no additional provision for income tax is required on the consolidated financial statements. The Company is subject to potential examination by certain taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The Company’s tax positions are subject to ongoing interpretation of laws and regulations by taxing authorities.
The Company has elected to be treated as a RIC commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2013. So long as the Company maintains its status as a RIC, it will generally not be required to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on any ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes at least annually to its stockholders as dividends. As a result, any U.S. federal income tax liability related to income earned and distributed by the Company represents obligations of the Company’s stockholders and will not be reflected on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
To maintain its tax treatment as a RIC, the Company must meet specified source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders for each taxable year at least 90% of its investment company taxable income (generally, its net ordinary income plus the excess of its realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction). In order for the Company not to be subject to U.S. federal excise taxes, it must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of its net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of its capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any net ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses for preceding years that were not distributed during such years. The Company, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on this income. If the Company chooses to do so, this generally would increase expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to stockholders. The Company will accrue excise tax on estimated undistributed taxable income as required. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 the Company accrued excise taxes of $1,254, $1,443 and $1,815. As of December 31, 2021, $1,356 of accrued excise taxes remained payable.
101
 

Certain of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. Income tax expense, if any, is included under the income category for which it applies on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Distributions
Distributions from net investment income and net realized capital gains are determined in accordance with U.S. federal income tax regulations, which may differ from those amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company may pay distributions in excess of its taxable net investment income. This excess would be a tax-free return of capital in the period and reduce the stockholder’s tax basis in its shares. These book/tax differences are either temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent they are charged or credited to paid-in capital in excess of par or distributable earnings, as appropriate, in the period that the differences arise. Temporary and permanent differences are primarily attributable to differences in the tax treatment of certain loans and the tax characterization of income and non-deductible expenses. These differences are generally determined in conjunction with the preparation of the Company’s annual RIC tax return. Distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount to be paid out as a distribution is determined by the Board of Directors each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by the Investment Adviser. The Company may pay distributions to its stockholders in a year in excess of its net ordinary income and capital gains for that year and, accordingly, a portion of such distributions may constitute a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company intends to timely distribute to its stockholders substantially all of its annual taxable income for each year, except that the Company may retain certain net capital gains for reinvestment and may carry forward taxable income for distribution in the following year and pay any applicable tax. The specific tax characteristics of the Company’s distributions will be reported to stockholders after the end of the calendar year. All distributions will be subject to available funds, and no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to declare such distributions in future periods.
The Company has a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of all cash distributions declared by the Board of Directors unless a stockholder elects to “opt out” of the plan. As a result, if the Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then the stockholders who have not “opted out” of the dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. Stockholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will generally be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions and, for this purpose, stockholders receiving distributions in the form of stock will generally be treated as receiving distributions equal to the fair market value of the stock received through the plan; however, since their cash distributions will be reinvested, those stockholders will not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes. Due to regulatory considerations, Group Inc. has opted out of the dividend reinvestment plan, and GS & Co. has opted out of the dividend reinvestment plan in respect of shares of the Company’s common stock acquired through any 10b5-1 plan the Company may adopt.
Deferred Financing and Debt Issuance Costs
Deferred financing and debt issuance costs consist of fees and expenses paid in connection with the closing of and amendments to the Company’s senior secured revolving credit agreement (as amended, the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with Truist Bank, as administrative agent, and Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, the offering of the Company’s 4.50% Convertible Notes due 2022 (the “Convertible Notes”), the offering of the Company’s 3.75% Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”), and the offering of the Company’s 2.875% Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”). The aforementioned costs are amortized using the straight-line method over each instrument’s term. Deferred financing costs related to the Revolving Credit Facility are presented separately as an asset on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Deferred debt issuance costs related to the Convertible Notes, the 2025 Notes, and the 2026 Notes are presented net against the outstanding debt balance on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.
3. SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Investment Management Agreement
The Company has entered into an investment management agreement (the “Investment Management Agreement”) with the Investment Adviser, pursuant to which the Investment Adviser manages the Company’s investment program and related activities.
Management Fee
The Company pays the Investment Adviser a management fee (the “Management Fee”), accrued and payable quarterly in arrears. The Management Fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.00% (0.25% per quarter) of the average value of the Company’s gross assets (excluding cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) at the end of each of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The Management Fee for any partial quarter will be appropriately prorated.
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, Management Fees amounted to $32,611, $16,846 and $14,696 and the Investment Adviser voluntarily agreed to waive $500, $3,806 and $0 of Management Fees. As of December 31, 2021, $8,370 remained payable.
102
 

Incentive Fee
The incentive fee (the “Incentive Fee”) consists of two components that are determined independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. The Incentive Fee is calculated as follows:
A portion of the Incentive Fee is based on income and a portion is based on capital gains, each as described below. The Investment Adviser is entitled to receive the Incentive Fee based on income if Ordinary Income (as defined below) exceeds a quarterly “hurdle rate” of 1.75%. For this purpose, the hurdle is computed by reference to the Company’s NAV and does not take into account changes in the market price of the Company’s common stock.
The Incentive Fee based on income is determined and paid quarterly in arrears at the end of each calendar quarter by reference to the Company’s aggregate net investment income, as adjusted as described below, from the calendar quarter then ending and the eleven preceding calendar quarters (such period the “Trailing Twelve Quarters”). The Incentive Fee based on capital gains is determined and paid annually in arrears at the end of each calendar year by reference to an “Annual Period,” which means the period beginning on January 1 of each calendar year and ending on December 31 of such calendar year or, in the case of the first and last year, the appropriate portion thereof.
The hurdle amount for the Incentive Fee based on income is determined on a quarterly basis and is equal to 1.75% multiplied by the Company’s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The hurdle amount is calculated after making appropriate adjustments for subscriptions (which includes all of the Company’s issuances of shares of its common stock, including issuances pursuant to its dividend reinvestment plan) and distributions that occurred during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The Incentive Fee for any partial period will be appropriately prorated.
i. Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Income
For the portion of the Incentive Fee based on income, the Company pays the Investment Adviser a quarterly Incentive Fee based on the amount by which (A) aggregate net investment income (“Ordinary Income”) in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds (B) the hurdle amount for such Trailing Twelve Quarters. The amount of the excess of (A) over (B) described in this paragraph for such Trailing Twelve Quarters is referred to as the “Excess Income Amount”. Ordinary Income is net of all fees and expenses, including the Management Fee but excluding any Incentive Fee.
The Incentive Fee based on income for each quarter is determined as follows:
•No Incentive Fee based on income is payable to the Investment Adviser for any calendar quarter for which there is no Excess Income Amount; 
 •100% of the Ordinary Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle amount, but is less than or equal to an amount, referred to as the “Catch-up Amount,” determined as the sum of 2.1875% multiplied by the Company’s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters is included in the calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income; and 
 •20% of the Ordinary Income that exceeds the Catch-up Amount is included in the calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income. 
 The amount of the Incentive Fee based on income that is paid to the Investment Adviser for a particular quarter equals the excess of the Incentive Fee so calculated minus the aggregate Incentive Fees based on income that were paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters but not in excess of the Incentive Fee Cap (as described below).
The Incentive Fee based on income that is paid to the Investment Adviser for a particular quarter is subject to a cap (the “Incentive Fee Cap”). The Incentive Fee Cap for any quarter is an amount equal to (a) 20% of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (b) the aggregate Incentive Fees based on income that were paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters.
“Cumulative Net Return” means (x) the Ordinary Income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (y) any Net Capital Loss, if any, in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the Company pays no Incentive Fee based on income to the Investment Adviser for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive value but is less than the Incentive Fee based on income that is payable to the Investment Adviser for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Company pays an Incentive Fee based on income to the Investment Adviser equal to the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the Incentive Fee based on income that is payable to the Investment Adviser for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Company pays an Incentive Fee based on income to the Investment Adviser equal to the Incentive Fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap.
103
 

“Net Capital Loss” in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period.
ii. Annual Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains
The portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains is calculated on an annual basis. For each Annual Period, the Company pays the Investment Adviser an amount equal to (A) 20% of the difference, if positive, of the sum of the Company’s aggregate realized capital gains, if any, computed net of the Company’s aggregate realized capital losses, if any, and the Company’s aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, in each case from April 1, 2013 until the end of such Annual Period minus (B) the cumulative amount of Incentive Fees based on capital gains previously paid to the Investment Adviser from April 1, 2013. For the avoidance of doubt, unrealized capital appreciation is excluded from the calculation in clause (A) above.
The Company accrues, but does not pay, a portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains with respect to net unrealized appreciation. Under GAAP, the Company is required to accrue an Incentive Fee based on capital gains that includes net realized capital gains and losses and net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. In calculating the accrual for the Incentive Fee based on capital gains, the Company considers the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, since an Incentive Fee based on capital gains would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee payable under the Investment Management Agreement. This accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then the Company records a capital gains incentive fee equal to 20% of such amount, minus the aggregate amount of actual Incentive Fees based on capital gains paid in all prior periods. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future.
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, Incentive Fees based on income amounted to $40,697, $35,845 and $9,220. As of December 31, 2021, $760 remained payable. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not accrue or pay any Incentive Fees based on capital gains.
 In connection with the Merger, GSAM has agreed to waive a portion of its Incentive Fee based on income to the extent incurred, for a period of nine quarters, commencing with the quarter ended December 31, 2019 and through and including the quarter ending December 31, 2021, otherwise payable by the Company under the Investment Management Agreement by and between the Company and GSAM, as applicable, for each such quarter in an amount sufficient to ensure that the Company’s net investment income per weighted share outstanding for such quarter is at least $0.48 per share. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, GSAM waived $4,544 and $23,070 of Incentive Fees. Additionally, GSAM voluntarily agreed to waive $26,534 and $10,110 of Incentive Fees for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 attributable to the purchase discount resulting from the Merger.
 Administration and Custodian Fees
The Company has entered into an administration agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company (the “Administrator”) under which the Administrator provides various accounting and administrative services to the Company. The Company pays the Administrator fees for its services as it determines to be commercially reasonable in its sole discretion. The Company also reimburses the Administrator for all reasonable expenses. To the extent that the Administrator outsources any of its functions, the Administrator pays any compensation associated with such functions. The Administrator also serves as the Company’s custodian (the “Custodian”).
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred expenses for services provided by the Administrator and the Custodian of $1,954, $1,151 and $957. As of December 31, 2021, $488 remained payable.
 Transfer Agent Fees
The Company has entered into a transfer agency and services agreement pursuant to which Computershare Trust Company, N.A. serves as the Company’s transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”), dividend agent and registrar. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred expenses for services provided by the Transfer Agent of $38, $25 and $14. As of December 31, 2021, $1 remained payable.
 Common Stock Repurchase Plans
In February 2019, the Board of Directors approved a 10b5-1 stock repurchase plan (the “2019 10b5-1 Plan”), which provided for the Company to repurchase up to $25,000 of shares of its common stock if the stock traded below the most recently announced NAV per share, subject to limitations. The 2019 10b5-1 Plan took effect on March 18, 2019, was temporarily suspended on December 9, 2019 and expired on March 18, 2020. The Company did not repurchase any of its common stock pursuant to the 2019 10b5-1 Plan or otherwise.
 In November 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the adoption of a new common stock repurchase plan (the “2020 10b5-1 Plan”), which provided for the Company to repurchase up to $75,000 of shares of the Company’s common stock if the stock traded below the most recently announced quarter-end NAV per share, subject to limitations. The 2020 10b5-1 Plan was adopted and took effect on November 9, 2020. The 2020 10b5-1 Plan expired on November 9, 2021. The Company did not repurchase any of its common stock pursuant to the 2020 10b5-1 Plan or otherwise.

Due to Affiliates
The Investment Adviser pays certain general and administrative expenses on behalf of the Company in the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there were $585 and $12 included within Accrued expenses and other liabilities paid by the Investment Adviser and its affiliates on behalf of the Company.
Co-investment Activity
In certain circumstances, negotiated co-investments by the Company and other funds managed by the Investment Adviser may be made only pursuant to an order from the SEC permitting the Company to do so. On January 4, 2017, the SEC granted GS PMMC and GS MMLC (which was merged with GS BDC on October 12, 2020) and us exemptive relief to co-invest with other funds managed by the GSAM Credit Alternatives investment team in a manner consistent with our investment objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Additionally, if our Investment Adviser forms other funds in the future (such as GS PMMC II and GS MMLC II), we and such other funds may co-invest on a concurrent basis with such other affiliates, subject to compliance with the exemptive relief, applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, as well as applicable allocation procedures. The GSAM Credit Alternatives Team is comprised of investment professionals dedicated to the Company’s investment strategy and other funds that share a similar investment strategy with the Company, who are responsible for identifying investment opportunities, conducting research and due diligence on prospective investments, negotiating and structuring the Company’s investments and monitoring and servicing the Company’s investments, together with investment professionals who are primarily focused on investment strategies in syndicated, liquid credit. Under the terms of the Exemptive Relief, a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act) of the Company’s independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to the Company and the Company’s stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Company or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company’s stockholders and is consistent with the then-current investment objectives and strategies of the Company. As a result of the Exemptive Relief, there could be significant overlap in the Company’s investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of the aforementioned funds and/or other funds established by the GSAM Credit Alternatives Team that could avail themselves of the Exemptive Relief.

5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e., the exit price).
 The fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The levels used for classifying investments are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
Basis of Fair Value Measurement
Level 1 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical instruments as of the reporting date. The types of financial instruments included in Level 1 include unrestricted securities, including equities and derivatives, listed in active markets.
Level 2 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. The types of financial instruments in this category include less liquid and restricted securities listed in active markets, securities traded in other than active markets, government and agency securities and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on observable inputs.
Level 3 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Financial instruments that are included in this category include investments in privately held entities and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs.
A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Note 2 “Significant Accounting Policies” should be read in conjunction with the information outlined below.
The table below presents the valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs generally used in determining the fair value of Level 2 and Level 3 Instruments.


Level 2 Instruments | Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs 
Equity and Fixed Income | The types of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active but are valued based on quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency include commercial paper, most government agency obligations, most corporate debt securities, certain mortgage-backed securities, certain bank loans, less liquid publicly listed equities, certain state and municipal obligations, certain money market instruments and certain loan commitments. Valuations of Level 2 Equity and Fixed Income instruments can be verified to quoted prices, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g. indicative or firm) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources. 
Derivative Contracts | OTC derivatives (both centrally cleared and bilateral) are valued using market transactions and other market evidence whenever possible, including market-based inputs to models, calibration to market-clearing transactions, broker or dealer quotations, or other alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Where models are used, the selection of a particular model to value an OTC derivative depends upon the contractual terms of, and specific risks inherent in, the instrument, as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. The Company generally uses similar models to value similar instruments. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, voluntary and involuntary prepayment rates, loss severity rates and correlations of such inputs. For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets, model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment. OTC derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy when significant inputs are corroborated by market evidence.

 
108
 



Level 3 Instruments | Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs 
Bank Loans, Corporate Debt, and Other DebtObligations | Valuations are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques, for which the significant inputs are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, market yields and recovery assumptions. The significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons both to credit default swaps that reference the same underlying credit risk and to other debt instruments for the same issuer for which observable prices or broker quotes are available. Other valuation methodologies are used as appropriate including market comparables, transactions in similar instruments and recovery/liquidation analysis. 
Equity | Recent third-party investments or pending transactions are considered to be the best evidence for any change in fair value. When these are not available, the following valuation methodologies are used, as appropriate and available (i) Transactions in similar instruments; (ii) Discounted cash flow techniques; (iii) Third party appraisals; and (iv) Industry multiples and public comparables.Evidence includes recent or pending reorganizations (for example, merger proposals, tender offers and debt restructurings) and significant changes in financial metrics, including (i) Current financial performance as compared to projected performance; (ii) Capitalization rates and multiples; and (iii) Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets.

 
The tables below present the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the Company’s Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. These ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of instrument, but they do not represent a range of values for any one instrument. For example, the lowest yield in 1st Lien/Senior Secured Debt is appropriate for valuing that specific debt investment, but may not be appropriate for valuing any other debt investments in this asset class. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs presented below do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of the Company’s Level 3 assets.

(1)As of December 31, 2021, included within the fair value of Level 3 assets of $3,270,660 is an amount of $604,533 for which the Investment Adviser did not develop the unobservable inputs (examples include single source broker quotations, third party pricing, and prior transactions). The income approach was used in the determination of fair value for $2,612,542 or 82.0% of Level 3 bank loans, corporate debt, and other debt obligations. 
 (2)As of December 31, 2020, included within the fair value of Level 3 assets of $3,050,769 is an amount of $553,963 for which the Investment Adviser did not develop the unobservable inputs (examples include single source broker quotations, third party pricing, and prior transactions). The income approach was used in the determination of fair value for $2,358,737 or 80.3% of Level 3 bank loans, corporate debt, and other debt obligations.

(3)The fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques. For example, market comparable and discounted cash flows may be used together to determine fair value. Therefore, the Level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques. 
 (4)The range for an asset category consisting of a single investment, if any, is not meaningful and therefore has been excluded. 
 (5)Weighted average for an asset category consisting of multiple investments is calculated by weighting the significant unobservable input by the relative fair value of the investment. Weighted average for an asset category consisting of a single investment represents the significant unobservable input used in the fair value of the investment. 
 (6)Enterprise value of portfolio company as a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”). 
 As noted above, the income and market approaches were used in the determination of fair value of certain Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The significant unobservable inputs used in the income approach are the discount rate or market yield used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment, which include both future principal and interest payments. An increase in the discount rate or market yield would result in a decrease in the fair value. Included in the consideration and selection of discount rates or market yields is risk of default, rating of the investment, call provisions and comparable company investments. The significant unobservable inputs used in the market approach are based on market comparable transactions and market multiples of publicly traded comparable companies. Increases or decreases in market comparable transactions or market multiples would result in an increase or decrease, in the fair value.
The following is a summary of the Company’s assets categorized within the fair value hierarchy:

 Convertible Notes
On October 3, 2016, the Company closed an offering of $115,000 aggregate principal amount of unsecured Convertible Notes, which includes $15,000 aggregate principal amount issued pursuant to the initial purchasers’ exercise in full of an over-allotment option (the “Initial Convertible Notes”).
On July 2, 2018, the Company closed an additional offering of $40,000 aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes (the “Additional Convertible Notes” and together with Initial Convertible Notes, the “Convertible Notes”). The Additional Convertible Notes have identical terms, are fungible with and are part of the Initial Convertible Notes.
The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, National Association, as Trustee (as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”)). The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing on April 1, 2017. The Convertible Notes will mature on April 1, 2022, unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. In certain circumstances, the Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, based on a conversion rate of 41.1666 shares of the Company’s common stock per one thousand dollars principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $24.29 per share of common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments and the other terms of the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. The conversion price of $24.29 is approximately 9.1% above the $22.26 per share closing price of the Company’s common stock on September 27, 2016 and 15.7% above the $20.99 per share closing price of our common stock on June 26, 2018. The Company will not have the right to redeem the Convertible Notes prior to maturity.
 Holders were permitted to convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding October 1, 2021 only under the following: (1) during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per one thousand dollars principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after October 1, 2021, until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any of the foregoing circumstances.
The Convertible Notes are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. Upon conversion of any of the Convertible Notes, the Company intends to pay the outstanding principal amount in cash and, to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, has the option to pay the excess amount in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock (or a combination of cash and shares), subject to the requirements of the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. The Company has determined that the embedded conversion options in the Convertible Notes are not required to be separately accounted for as derivatives under ASC Topic 815,

The Company records interest expense comprised of both stated interest and amortization of the OID. At the time of issuance, the equity components of the Initial Convertible Notes and the Additional Convertible Notes were $743 and $836. Additionally, the issuance costs associated with the Convertible Notes were allocated to the debt and equity components in proportion to the allocation of the values at the time of issuance and accounted for as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs.

7. DERIVATIVES
The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to help mitigate the impact that an adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have on the value of the Company’s investments denominated in foreign currencies.
In order to better define its contractual rights and to secure rights that will help the Company mitigate its counterparty risk, the Company may enter into an International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. Master Agreement (“ISDA Master Agreement”) or a similar agreement with its derivative counterparties. An ISDA Master Agreement is a bilateral agreement between the Company and a counterparty that governs OTC derivatives, including foreign currency forward contracts, and typically contains, among other things, collateral posting terms and netting provisions in the event of a default and/or termination event. The provisions of the ISDA Master Agreement typically permit a single net payment in the event of a default (close-out netting) or similar event, including the bankruptcy or insolvency of the counterparty.
For financial reporting purposes, cash collateral that has been pledged to cover obligations of the Company and cash collateral received from the counterparty, if any, is included on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as due to/due from broker. The Company minimizes counterparty credit risk by only entering into agreements with counterparties that they believe to be of good standing and by monitoring the financial stability of those counterparties.
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company’s average USD notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts was $2,829 and $3,435.
 The Company’s net exposure to foreign currency forward contracts by counterparty that are subject to ISDA Master Agreements or similar agreements presented on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities was as follows:

 Contingencies
In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts that provide a variety of general indemnifications.

Currently, no such claims exist or are expected to arise and, accordingly, the Company has not accrued any liability in connection with such indemnifications.

9. NET ASSETS
Equity Issuances
On October 12, 2020, in connection with the Merger, the Company issued an aggregate of 61,037,311 shares of Common Stock to former GS MMLC stockholders. There were no equity issuances of the Company’s common stock during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2019.
Distributions
The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of all cash distributions declared by the Board of Directors, unless a stockholder elects to “opt out” of the plan. As a result, if the Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then the stockholders who have not “opted out” of the dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. The shares distributed by the Transfer Agent in the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan are either through (i) newly issued shares or (ii) acquired by the Transfer Agent through the purchase of outstanding shares on the open market. If, on the payment date for any distribution, the most recently computed NAV per share as of the dividend payment date is equal to or less than the closing market price plus estimated per share fees, the Transfer Agent will invest the distribution amount in newly issued shares. Otherwise, the Transfer Agent will invest the dividend amount in shares acquired by purchasing shares on the open market. The following table summarizes the distributions declared on shares of the Company’s common stock and shares distributed pursuant to the dividend reinvestment plan to stockholders who had not opted out of the dividend reinvestment plan:

10. EARNINGS PER SHARE
The following information sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:


 | For the Years Ended December 31, | 
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | | 2019
Net increase in net assets from operations | $ | 192,427 | | $ | 176,113 | | $ | 36,148 
Weighted average shares outstanding | | 101,691,076 | | | 53,940,573 | | | 40,313,662
Basic and diluted earnings per share | $ | 1.89 | | $ | 3.26 | | $ | 0.90 

 
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per common share, the average closing price of the Company’s common stock for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was less than the conversion price for the Convertible Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Therefore, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, diluted earnings per share equal basic earnings per share because the underlying shares for the intrinsic value of the embedded options in the Convertible Notes were not dilutive.

11. TAX INFORMATION
 The tax character of distributions was as follows:
 

 | For the Years Ended December 31, | 
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | | 2019
Distributions paid from: | | | | | | 
Ordinary Income | $ | 198,332 | | $ | 100,254 | | $ | 72,574

Total Accumulated Earnings (Losses)—net | $ | (55,023 | ) | | $ | (5,353 | ) | $ | (100,626 | )

 
(1)The Company utilized $10,629 of capital losses. 
 
The Company's ability to utilize its capital loss carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
The Company’s aggregate unrealized appreciation and depreciation on investments based on cost for U.S. federal income tax purposes were as follows:
 

 | December 31, 2021 | | | December 31, 2020 | | | December 31, 2019
Tax cost | $ | 3,492,053 | | | $ | 3,165,681 | | $ | 1,426,453 | 
Gross unrealized appreciation | $ | 77,992 | | | $ | 146,963 | | $ | 24,149 | 
Gross unrealized depreciation | $ | (91,468 | ) | | $ | (74,418 | ) | $ | (82,320 | )
Net unrealized investment appreciation (depreciation) on investments | $ | (13,476 | ) | | $ | 72,545 | | $ | (58,171 | )

 
The difference between GAAP-basis and tax basis unrealized gains (losses) is attributable primarily to wash sales, net mark to market gains (losses) on foreign currency contracts, and differences in the tax treatment of underlying fund investments, and material modification of debt securities.
 In order to present certain components of the Company’s capital accounts on a tax-basis, certain reclassifications have been recorded to the Company’s accounts. These reclassifications have no impact on the net asset value of the Company and result primarily from certain non-deductible expenses, and differences in the tax treatment of underlying fund investments. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company reclassified $43,765, $(19,414) and $(26,743) from total distributable earnings to paid-in capital in excess of par.
 The following reconciles net increase in net assets resulting from operations to taxable income:

Taxable income (1) | $ | 224,206 | | | $ | 97,187 | | $ | 76,557 | 

 

(1)Taxable income is an estimate and is not fully determined until the Company’s tax return is filed.
 ASC Topic 740, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”) provides guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in tax position. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company’s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are “more-likely-than-not” of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Based on its analysis of its tax position for all open tax years (the current and prior years, as applicable), the Company has concluded that it does not have any uncertain tax positions that met the recognition or measurement criteria of ASC 740. Such open tax years remain subject to examination and adjustment by tax authorities.

 On October 12, 2020, the Company completed its merger with GS MMLC pursuant to the Merger Agreement, dated as of June 11, 2020. The Company was the accounting survivor of the Merger. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of GS MMLC common stock was converted into the right to receive, for each share of GS MMLC common stock, that number of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, with a NAV equal to the NAV per share of GS MMLC common stock, in each case calculated as of October 9, 2020. As a result, the Company issued an aggregate of 61,037,311 shares of Common Stock to the former GS MMLC stockholders.
The Merger was accounted for as an asset acquisition in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations—Related Issues. The consideration paid to GS MMLC’s stockholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the “purchase discount”). The purchase discount was allocated to the cost of GS MMLC investments acquired by the Company on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the closing date. Immediately following the Merger with GS MMLC, the investments were marked to their respective fair values and, as a result, the purchase discount allocated to the cost basis of the investments acquired was immediately recognized as unrealized appreciation on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The purchase discount allocated to the loan investments acquired will amortize over the life of each respective loan through interest income with a corresponding adjustment recorded as unrealized depreciation on such loans acquired through their ultimate disposition. The purchase discount allocated to equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, the Company will recognize a realized gain with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired. The Merger was considered a tax-free reorganization and the Company has elected to carry forward the historical cost basis of the GS MMLC investments for tax purposes.
