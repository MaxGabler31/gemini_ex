          ITEM 1. BUSINESS
     DAVIDsTEA’s common shares trade on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “DTEA”. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “DAVIDsTEA” and the “Company” refer to DAVIDsTEA Inc. and its subsidiary. All references to “Fiscal 2015” are to the Company’s fiscal year ended January 30, 2016. All references to “Fiscal 2016” are to the Company’s fiscal year ended January 28, 2017. All references to “Fiscal 2017” are to the Company’s fiscal year ended February 3, 2018. The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to the end of January, typically resulting in a 52-week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53-week year. The years ended January 30, 2016 and January 28, 2017 cover a 52-week period. The year ended February 3, 2018 covers a 53-week fiscal period.     Our Company
     DAVIDsTEA is a branded retailer of specialty tea, offering a differentiated selection of proprietary loose-leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories, food and beverages primarily through 240 company-operated DAVIDsTEA stores as of February 3, 2018, and our website, davidstea.com. Our passion for and knowledge of tea permeates our culture and is rooted in an excitement to explore the taste, health and lifestyle elements of tea. 
     We strive to make tea a multi‑sensory experience by facilitating interaction with our products through education and sampling so that our customers appreciate the compelling attributes of tea as well as the ease of preparation. We design our stores with a modern and simple aesthetic that, coupled with our teal‑colored logo, create an inviting atmosphere and stand in stark contrast to common perceptions of tea as a more traditional product. We are also bringing this experience online to enhance our consumers’

interaction with tea. Our in‑store “Tea Guides” help novice and experienced tea drinkers alike select from the approximately 135 premium teas and tea blends featured on our “Tea Wall,” which is the focal point of our stores. We replicate our store experience online by engaging users with rich content that allows them to easily explore their options amongst our many tea and tea‑related offerings. Consistent with our stores, davidstea.com features our innovative products while offering expertise, community and numerous tools to aid the discovery and exploration of tea.
     We sell our products primarily through our company-operated retail stores and e-commerce site, giving us control of the presentation of our brand as well as greater interaction with the customer. We have a dedicated and highly experienced product development team that is constantly creating new tea blends using high‑quality ingredients from around the world. We capitalize on our product development capabilities with approximately 75 new tea blends each year that we rotate into our offering on a continuous basis. We also focus on product innovation in our pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories and food and beverages, providing our customers with fun, inventive and more convenient ways to enjoy tea. 
     During Fiscal 2017, 70% of our revenue was driven by the sale of loose‑leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea‑related gifts that consumers enjoy at home, on‑the‑go or at work. The balance of our revenue was driven by tea accessories, 22%, and food and beverages, 8%. See Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding our revenues by product category for each of the past three fiscal years as well as information about our geographic operating segments.
     Our Market and Competition
    
The Canadian and U.S. tea markets are highly fragmented. We compete with a large number of relatively small independently owned tea retailers and a number of regional tea retailers, as well as retailers of grocery products, including loose‑leaf teas, tea sachets and tea-related beverages. We also compete with other vendors of loose‑leaf teas, tea sachets and ready‑to‑drink teas, such as club stores, wholesalers and Internet suppliers, as well as with houseware retailers and suppliers that offer teawares and related accessories.
     We believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors on the basis of our distinct retail experience, the broad demographic appeal of our brand, innovative tea products driven by customer insights, the effectiveness of our e-commerce website and grassroots marketing strategy, our versatile store economics and our passionate customer-focused culture supported by our experienced management team and dedicated board members. 
     Our Stores and Operations
 Our Stores
     As of February 3, 2018, our retail footprint consisted of 190 stores in Canada and 50 stores in the United States. Our retail stores are located primarily within malls, including lifestyle centers and outlets, and on street locations. Each store exterior prominently displays the DAVIDsTEA teal signage. In Fiscal 2017, our average store was approximately 900 square feet. See Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding our long-lived assets in Canada and the US.     Distinctive Retail Experience
     The DAVIDsTEA experience starts with our people both in stores, our Tea Guides, and at our service support center. Our people’s knowledge and passion permeate our culture and are rooted in a deep knowledge of, and desire to share, the compelling attributes of tea. A key element of the retail experience is our “Tea Wall,” a focal point of the store, which displays approximately 135 premium teas and tea blends. Our Tea Guides help create a highly interactive and immersive customer experience and we strive to make tea a multi‑sensory experience. Indeed, they facilitate the interaction with our products through education and sampling so that our customers appreciate the compelling attributes of tea as well as the ease of preparation. Every visit to our stores is designed to create a sense of adventure for our customers, from novice and experienced tea drinkers alike, as our knowledgeable, personable and passionate Tea Guides assist our customers in navigating the “Tea Wall” by selecting a variety of teas for customers to smell based on their taste preferences. 
     In fiscal 2018, we expect to renovate up to five of our stores to be similar to our new DT 2.0 hybrid concept store, which enables customers to “self-shop” and buy pre-packaged teas, helping accelerate service levels and reduce wait times. We currently anticipate that elements of these concept stores will become key components of our future store renovation program.

 Site Selection and Store Portfolio
     We seek to maintain our stores in strategic locations that support the brand image, targeting high customer traffic locations primarily within malls, including lifestyle centers and outlets, and on street locations. We regularly review our store portfolio, identifying new store locations and monitoring existing locations for sufficient levels of customer traffic to maintain a successful store. We actively monitor and manage the performance of our stores and increasingly seek to incorporate information learned through the monitoring process into our analytic process and future site selection and store retention decisions.     Store Management, Culture and Training
     We are guided by a philosophy that recognizes customer service and the importance of delivering optimal performance, allowing us to identify and reward teams that meet our high performance standards. We use store-level scorecards that report key performance indicators. We provide our store managers with a number of analytical tools to support our store operations and assist them in attaining optimum store performance. These tools include key performance indicator reports, coaching logs for one‑on‑one meetings, weekly one‑on‑one meetings between our store managers and district managers and annual evaluations. While our focus is on the overall performance of the team and our stores, we provide incentives to team members, store managers and district managers.
· | Passion for Tea. We believe our passionate and fun Tea Guides are a major element of our retail experience. We seek to recruit, hire, train, retain and promote qualified, knowledgeable and enthusiastic team members who share our passion for tea and strive to deliver an extraordinary retail experience to our customers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Extensive Training. We have specific training and certification requirements for all new team members, including undergoing food handlers’ certification and foundational training. This process helps ensure that all team members educate our customers and execute our standards accurately and consistently. As team members progress to the assistant manager and manager levels, they undergo additional weeks of training in sales, operations and management.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Career Development and Individual Enrichment. We track and reward team member performance, which we believe incentivizes excellence and helps us identify top performers and thus maintain a sufficient talent pool to support our growth. Many of our store managers and district managers are promoted from within our organization. We are guided by a philosophy that recognizes performance, allowing us to identify and reward teams who meet our high performance standards.

      Our core values and distinctive corporate culture allow us to attract passionate and friendly employees who share a vision of making tea fun and accessible. We have a strong focus on community engagement, and our culture reflects our belief in doing right by our customers and our communities. We provide our employees with extensive training, career development, individual enrichment, and empowerment, which we believe is a key contributor for our success. 
     Our Digital Platform
     Our digital platform is primarily comprised of our website, www.davidstea.com. Our e‑commerce sales represented 12.2% of total sales for Fiscal 2017, compared to 10.6% and 9.4% of sales for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015, respectively. Our new e-commerce platform, launched in April 2018, is a core part of DAVIDsTEA`s plans to grow online sales and will support further growth.
     Our website features our full assortment of premium loose‑leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories and food. To drive increased sales through our digital platform, we utilize online‑specific marketing and promotions. In addition, we employ banner advertisements, search engine optimization and pay‑per‑click arrangements to help drive customer traffic to our website. In Fiscal 2018, we are introducing new marketing and core gap features that will further enhance the website experience, improve its accessibility for mobile users, and provide a solid platform to start selling on Amazon, which we anticipate will happen before the 2018 holiday season.
     Through our e-commerce platform, we can reach customers who may not live near one of our retail locations. We believe our digital platform and our stores are complementary, as our digital platform provides our store customers an additional channel through which to purchase our teas and tea‑related products while also helping drive awareness of and customer traffic to our stores.
     Our digital platform also includes our social media platform on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, LinkedIn, YouTube, Snapchat and Yelp. We will continue to leverage our growing social media presence to increase our e‑commerce site sales and drive additional store visits within existing and new markets.

     Our Wholesale Distribution
     We currently sell tea products to HRI (Hotel, Restaurant and Institution) distribution channels. As part of our strategic initiatives in 2018, we are exploring potential growth opportunities in wholesale distribution to other channels including grocery and club.        Our Product Categories
     We offer approximately 135 premium loose‑leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories and food primarily through our retail stores and e-commerce site. Additionally, we offer on‑the‑go tea beverages in our retail stores.
     Teas
     Our loose‑leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts that consumers can enjoy at home, on‑the‑go or at work, represented 70% of our sales in Fiscal 2017, 66% in Fiscal 2016 and 66% in Fiscal 2015. Our different flavors of loose-leaf tea span eight different tea categories: white, green, oolong, black, pu’erh, mate, rooibos and herbal tea. Furthermore, approximately 80% of our teas are blended with other ingredients while approximately 20% are straight teas. Our teas and ingredients used in our tea blends are sourced from various regions around the world, including but not limited to, China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, India, Nepal, Kenya, Sri Lanka and South Africa. In addition to loose‑leaf teas, we sell pre‑packaged teas and tea sachets to make the tea experience more convenient for some customers. Our tea-related gifts include special edition seasonal and holiday gift packages.     Tea Accessories
     Our tea accessories, representing 22% of our sales in Fiscal 2017, 25% in Fiscal 2016 and 24% in Fiscal 2015, are created to make the tea preparation process and tea experience more convenient and fun and easy at home or on-the-go for customers. Tea accessories include tea mugs, travel mugs, teacup sets, teapots, tea makers, kettles, infusers, filters, frothers, tins and spoons. Many of our accessories are crafted with unique features to improve tea preparation and consumption. Most of our accessories are crafted with unique colors and designs.     Food and Beverages
     Our retail stores offer tea beverages for on‑the‑go consumption and our retail stores and e-commerce site offer food products, which together represented 8% of our sales in Fiscal 2017, 9% in Fiscal 2016 and 10% in Fiscal 2015. Our beverages range from the standard hot or iced tea to our Tea Lattes.      Product Development and Design
     Our tea and merchandising teams travel throughout the world seeking premium teas and tea-related products. These teams consist of Tea Blend Developers, Product Designers, Category Merchants and Quality Control Personnel, who leverage our extensive experience in selecting and developing our product assortment. We are constantly exploring different ingredients, flavors and trends that are popular in a variety of cultures from which we introduce new teas to our customers. Our research and development team works with our blenders and suppliers to create new and exciting flavors of tea, which we rotate into our product offering to attract new customers and keep current customers coming back. Our blending process is very focused on magnifying the senses and bringing smell and taste to the forefront. We introduce new flavors and blends each month as well as around seasonal holidays. In Fiscal 2017, we conducted extensive research to identify key customer segments and preferences to help re-evaluate our product assortment and institute a more effective product release cadence. We believe our focus on innovation and product development is a key differentiating factor for our brand that drives our customer’s loyalty.
     Our innovation also extends to creating new and exciting merchandise to make the tea consumption and experience more convenient and easy at home or on-the-go. We have a competitive advantage in that our merchandising team designs and develops most of our products in‑house. Therefore, we are better positioned to create unique and proprietary designs to make consuming loose‑leaf tea easier and more fun for our customers. We believe our combination of product selection and product innovation allows us to offer customers a distinctive assortment that differentiates us from other specialty tea retailers.

 Marketing and Advertising
     We differentiate our business through a field‑based marketing approach to build brand awareness and drive customers to our stores and e‑commerce site in both new and existing markets. Our marketing and advertising efforts are led by a strong marketing and merchandising team, which was solidified in Fiscal 2017. 
     We customize our marketing mix for each of our markets and purposes through our events sponsorship group. Our events sponsorship group engages directly in the communities around our stores and drives store visits by offering product samplings and beverage coupons, and by participating in both hyper‑local and large‑scale events. These events are identified and coordinated by our local store managers and Tea Guides with support from our dedicated corporate events team.
     Sourcing and Manufacturing
     We do not own or operate any tea estates or blending operations; instead, we work with vendors who source ingredients for our teas and tea blends from all over the world. The majority of our tea blenders are in either Germany or the United States. Since we founded the Company in 2008, we have developed strong relationships with our vendors. These relationships are important as we depend on our vendors to provide us with the highest quality teas and ingredients from around the world. We have a process of quality control, which includes in-house testing and vendor testing. In addition to bringing our designs for tea blends to fruition, our vendors are important to the quality control process and ensuring our teas meet applicable regulatory guidelines.      Warehouse and Distribution Facilities
     We distribute our loose-leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories and food to our stores and our e‑commerce customers from distribution centers in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Quebec and Champlain, New York. We use third party shipping facilities in Sherbrooke, Quebec and Champlain, New York. The Sherbrooke facility ships to our Canadian stores and e‑commerce customers. The Champlain, New York facility ships to all our U.S. stores and to our U.S. e-commerce customers. Our products are typically shipped to our stores and our e‑commerce customers via a third‑party national transportation provider multiple times per week.     Management Information Systems
     Our management information systems provide a full range of business process supports to our stores, our store operations and service support center teams. Additionally, we operate our e‑commerce site on an independent platform. We utilize a combination of industry‑standard and customized software systems to provide various functions related to:
· | point of sales;

· | inventory management;

· | warehouse management, and;

· | accounting and financial reporting.

      Government Regulation
     We are subject to labor and employment laws, import and trade restrictions laws, laws governing advertising, privacy and data security laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that apply to retailers and/or the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. In the United States, we are subject to the regulatory authority of, among other agencies, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). We are also subject to the laws of Canada, including the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, as well as provincial and local regulations. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws.     Insurance
     We maintain third-party insurance for a number of risk management activities including but not limited to a worker’s compensation, general liability, property, directors and officers, cyber insurance and employee-related health care benefits.

     Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
     We regard intellectual property and other proprietary rights as important to our success. We own several trademarks and servicemarks that have been registered with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, including DAVIDsTEA®. We have also registered our stylized logos. We also own domain names, including davidstea.com. In addition, we have registered or made application to register one or more of our marks in a number of foreign countries and expect to continue to do so in the future. There can be no assurance that we can obtain the registration for the marks in every country where registration has been sought.
     We also rely upon trade secrets and know‑how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our intellectual property rights through a variety of methods including trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and others who have access to our proprietary information.
     We must constantly protect against any infringement by competitors. If a competitor infringes on our trademark rights, we may take action to protect our rights, which could result in litigation, in which case, we may incur significant expenses and divert significant attention from our business operations.
     Employees
     As of the end of Fiscal 2017, we had 2,988 employees. As of February 3, 2018, we employed a total of 481 full‑time employees and 2,507 part‑time employees, with 512 in the United States and 2,476 in Canada. Of all those employees, 2,763 were employed in our retail channel and 225 were employed in corporate, distribution and direct channel support functions. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We believe we have a good relationship with our employees.     Seasonality
     Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations, reflecting increased sales during the year-end holiday season. Our sales and income are generally highest in the fourth quarter, which includes the year-end holiday sales period, and tends to be lowest in the second and third fiscal quarters. Therefore, operating results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year. To prepare for the year-end holiday season, we must order and keep in inventory more merchandise than we carry during other parts of the year. We expect inventory levels, along with an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, to reach their highest levels in the third and fourth quarters in anticipation of the increased net sales during the year-end holiday season. As a result of this seasonality, and generally because of variations in consumer spending habits, we experience fluctuations in net sales, net income and working capital requirements during the year.
