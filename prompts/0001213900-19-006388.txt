ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
Medifirst Solutions, Inc. (“Medifirst” and the “Company”) was incorporated in Nevada in November 2010. Our principal executive office is located at 4400 U.S. 9 South, Suite 1000, Freehold NJ, 07726, and our telephone number is (732) 786-8044. Our website address is www.medifirstsolutions.com. The Company began as a development stage company focused on developing products within the healthcare market for both consumer and professional applications. Medifirst has had several different products and related distribution and sales services which include: its own line of disposable electronic cigarettes (“e-cigs”), Light Therapy for therapeutic healthcare use and home water machines which made water from air. In 2015, the Company made a strategic decision to add laser technology to its health and wellness division and discontinue its efforts with other products and divisions. Management believed that it was in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to narrow its focus and business to developing its laser technology, which lasers are expected to target professionals that treat pain and inflammation, as well as cosmetic and skincare related conditions. In connection with the changed focus, the Company began to develop a product that if successfully cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), would be the first in a series of proprietary medical devices for the Company. The Company entered into an exclusive manufacturing agreement to produce what is now its hand-held mobile laser system known as “The Time Machine Program” for which the Company purchased the registered trademark. Furthermore, the Company purchased inventory from the developer of the lasers.
 
Additionally, Medifirst, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Medical Laser Manufacturer, Inc., entered into a Product and Know-How License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Laser Lab Corp to license the use of various intellectual property in connection with seeking regulatory approval for and marketing, distributing and selling The Time Machine Series Lasers (“TM Lasers”). The License Agreement grants a license to the Company to use various technology, trade secrets, invention records, research records, reports and data, test results, clinical studies, engineering and technical data, designs, production specifications, processes, methods, procedures, facilities and know-how related to the inventions identified in the License Agreement, which inventions include the infrared laser in the TM Lasers for which the Company previously filed a Premarket Notification 510(k) submission with the FDA. Although the License is not exclusive, Laser Lab Corp may not license the know-how or inventions to a third party and may only directly, or through its wholly-owned subsidiary, use the know-how and inventions. In addition to the license granted to the Company, the License Agreement provides for an option to license other fields of use of the infrared laser in the TM Lasers, as well as additional wavelengths and colors, allowing the Company to develop a broader range of product offerings in the future. Furthermore, Laser Lab Corp granted the Company a right of first refusal to consider matching any bona fide offer to license other technologies of Laser Lab Corp.
 
On July 8, 2016, we received clearance from the FDA to market its infrared Time Machine TTML-8102000 Laser Thermal Therapeutic Device (TM Laser). The FDA does not give advance notice or define a timeline during their evaluation for 510(k) clearance. Generally, when 510(k) clearance is granted, an early stage medical device company, such as Medifirst, is required to put together an infrastructure, including (i) new office space, (ii) instituting FDA controls and procedures, (iii) fine-tuning manufacturing, (iv) building and executing on sales strategies, (v) producing custom-made cases and packaging for the medical device, and (vi) aligning all staffing, consulting and personnel needs. As Medifirst was aware that the FDA time frame was unknown and 510(k) clearance was not guaranteed, we intentionally delayed the aggressive expansion of our operations and production before successfully receiving clearance to begin sales. The U.S., as well as countries across the globe, are currently facing a critical opioid addiction crisis, one that has reached epidemic proportions. The need is greater than ever for effective natural and non-invasive means to help people who suffer from pain and chronic pain. Globally, it is estimated that 1.5 billion people suffer from moderate to severe chronic pain. Pain is the leading cause of disability in the U.S., affecting, according to industry reports we believe up to 116 million adults, more than heart disease, cancer and diabetes combined. Pain continues to represent major clinical, social and economic challenges. Despite two decades of intensive R&D efforts, commercialization of new products targeting pain management has been limited. The opioid and narcotics addiction is often a hidden secret amongst families due to embarrassment and stigma.

Since receiving clearance, we presented our laser and established business relationships in Morocco, China, Asia, Mid-East, Southeast Asia, Latin America and other international countries and markets. The international markets, although requiring complicated registration processes and ground work, offer the opportunity for significant distribution sales which would be very beneficial for the Company's growth. Medifirst believes it has made significant progress in setting up a sales and corporate infrastructure and continues to advance these efforts.
 
Medifirst believes that doctors can improve their patient’s quality of life by using the TTML-810/2000 Infrared Laser therapy. Laser therapy such as ours, is a rapidly growing drug-free treatment modality used in pain management. The learning and teaching curve is simple and straightforward and it is a natural and drug-free alternative to pills and narcotics. That is why we believe the TTML-810/2000 Infrared Laser is a viable pain solution. When used properly, it targets the root cause of the pain. The TTML-810/2000 Infrared Laser is a user friendly, easy-to-use, mobile, hand-held laser device, with pinpoint accuracy. The device gives fast results with no burning, redness, swelling or downtime for the patients which is prevalent with other medical lasers. Because the laser does not touch the skin there is no risk of transmission of virus or bacteria. The Laser treatment is safe, painless and fast. Patients feel a soothing warmth as laser energy gently penetrates the tissue and boosts the body’s own regeneration powers to relieve pain. The treatments are usually administered for 8 to 10 minutes, depending on the location on the body. The beneficial effects may often be experienced immediately, but most observed-results begin after 2 to 6 treatment sessions. In addition, the body continues to benefit from the effects of the therapy for 18-24 hours after treatment. During this time, modulated cellular activity leads to decreased pain and inflammation.
 
Regarding the US market, the Company plans to ramp up efforts to promote and present the laser to medical practitioners both in their offices as well as conferences and trade shows. The Company is engaged in ongoing due diligence as related to selling its TM Laser to the consumer OTC market. This process includes meeting home safety standards, FDA resubmission as well as a new clinical home study. The Company believes that chronic pain and simple everyday pain effects millions of people. The Company believes there is potential great benefit for OTC RX home use with the prescribing doctor training and educating the patient on how to use the Laser safely and effectively. This goes to the source of the pain and reduces and/or eliminates pain by the process of eliminating inflammation via Photobiomodulation. Consistency is key to receiving the Laser treatment to gain the maximum results of the treatment to temporary increase in local blood circulation and temporary relaxation of muscles by means of topical elevated tissue temperature from infrared spectral emissions. It is of great advantage to the patient to have the Laser for home use. This is especially needed by patients who are non-ambulatory as well as financially challenged or simply unable to get to a doctor's office several times a week.
 
Recent Developments
 
In the middle of fiscal year 2018, the Company incorporated Concierge Concepts Rx Inc. (CCRx) in the State of New Jersey, to be an 100% majority-owned subsidiary. Medifirst test-launched Concierge Concepts Rx, a new division focused on the pharmaceutical industry, to provide unique specialty drug consulting and niche billing services to independent pharmacies and retail pharmacy chains. CCRx services of specialty drug pharmacy consulting and revenue stream management utilizes over 60 years of combined specialty pharmacy and infusion therapy experience. The services are designed to increase profits for pharmacies.  Services will include: clinical review, expedited medical insurance verification, training for drug dispensing, insurance billing, collections, and reconciliation. The billing services will address any denials and include appeals and resubmissions. The division will provide key services to undervalued clients by securing reimbursement of overlooked revenue within the ever-expanding market of the specialty pharmacy market in today's healthcare system. As we are in the early stages of development, we are testing our new business strategies and affiliations. Although we are showing revenue related to certain target market viability testing, such revenues may not sustain or be recreated until, if ever, we complete and review our test-market and roll-out strategies and determine a long-term strategy for growth and direction.

In November of 2018, Medifirst announced that it has launched USA Pharma Corporation (“USA Pharma”), its division for CBD distribution, sales and products and that it completed an agreement with Dr. Gupta Pharma LLC to exclusively distribute their line of premium CBD oils in New Jersey and non-exclusive in all other states. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, not related to Dr. Gupta of CNN, is a Harvard-trained physician who specializes in the treatment of pain, has significant experience using Marijuana and CBD for treating pain. As the President of the American Pain Association, Dr. Gupta believes that CBD, used under the guidance of a physician, can play a significant role in reducing pain and helping to curb the opioid epidemic. Additionally, he believes CBD can play a major role in overall health and wellness but, he concedes, CBD remains underutilized as there is a substantial lack of education and stigma from public and healthcare providers with regards to the benefits of CBD. Based on his clinical and research work and using proprietary patented methods, Dr. Gupta is working to develop and market premium CBD oils and wellness products that he believes can benefit patients suffering from many different health conditions. USA Pharma anticipates marketing and developing additional CBD products to round out its line for consumers. At the time of this filings, Dr. Gupta has still not completed his CBD products for markets and sales. In addition, with the FDA considering regulations that could affect the CBD industry and market, we are still in the due diligence stage and have not yet formed a firm business plan and rollout.
 
The Time Machine Series Laser
 
FDA 510(k) Clearance
 
On July 8, 2016, we received clearance from the FDA to market its infrared Time Machine TTML-8102000 Laser Thermal Therapeutic Device.
 
Applications
 
Indication for use: The Time Machine Series Lasers Model TTML-8102000 - 810/830nm is intended for use in temporary relief of minor muscle and joint pain, stiffness, minor arthritis pain, muscle spasm, temporary increase in local blood circulation and temporary relaxation of muscles by means of topical elevated tissue temperature from infrared spectral emissions.
Specifications
 
The Time Machine Infrared Laser 810/830nm operates in continuous wave mode set at a fixed frequency. The Infrared laser operates at a 810/830nm wavelength and at 2000mw, as set forth in our 510(k) submission. The Laser is hand-held and mobile. It works on rechargeable batteries, has 6,000 hours of usage against average treatments of 8 minutes for a specified area to treat and has specifications that are often found on larger more expense laser machines.
Manufacturing Agreement
 
Medifirst has an exclusive manufacturing agreement allowing us to exclusively purchase various lasers in the TM Lasers having a range of wavelengths and colors, including Infrared, Green, Red, Violet, Ultra-Violet and Blue. We believe that our present manufacturing capacity at these facilities is sufficient to meet foreseeable demand for our products. We have established a quality control program, including a set of standard manufacturing and documentation procedures intended to ensure that, where required, our products are manufactured in accordance with applicable FDA regulations and the comparable requirements of the European community and other countries.
Business Plan
 
We have begun to solicit to sell our TM Infrared laser in the U.S. and international marketplace. The current strategy to rolling out the products will be multifaceted, starting with trade shows, direct sales, marketing and advertising and partnering with medical device distributors. Medifirst has implemented internal controls and procedures as mandated by the FDA, including checks and balances to be implemented prior to sale in the Company’s office, which procedures will also be put in place at the Company’s manufacturer. The Company continues to actively engage additional sales and distribution affiliates to offer our lasers in the US market. Furthermore, we expect to engage various product marketing teams to introduce our brand and products to direct and indirect customers of the TM Lasers.
 
We have started our sales initiatives from our new office space for FDA controls and procedures and for training. We are actively interviewing sales and marketing professionals on an ongoing basis to introduce the Time Machine technology to the US and international markets. As part of our sales strategy, we will highlight to the medical communities our belief that the Time Machine hand-held mobile laser unit offers a very unique, effective and affordable alternative to the extremely costly and bulky laser machines current being offered in the marketplace.

The Company has presented the Time Machine Lasers to distributors and healthcare professionals in China, Latin America, Southeast Asia, Toronto, Morocco, Dubai and Paris and continues to follow up to initiate sales. In the U.S. market, the Company has enlisted sales representatives in New Jersey, Florida and New York City. Currently the Company is introducing, demonstrating and conducting training for the Lasers at the offices of its Medical Directors in New York City and Boca Raton, Florida, as well as in the corporate office in New Jersey.
 
The healthcare professionals that we believe will benefit from incorporating the TM Lasers into their practices include medical doctors, oral surgeons, chiropractors, pain specialists, dentists, cosmetic professional as well as hospitals and surgical centers. We also believe that our lasers will be useful to medi-spas, massage therapists, electrolysis providers, physical therapists and any professional that treats pain, inflammation and scarring. Because laser regulations vary from state-to-state, healthcare professionals will need to research their state-specific compliance requirements regarding their authorized usage.
 
The Time Machine Laser Series and Program (“TMP”) will be affordable and priced very competitively, as compared to other lasers in the industry which can typically cost tens of thousands of dollars. The Company currently offers financing through a third party for as little as just over two hundred dollars a month. List price is $9,995 and the company has the flexibility to offer deep discounts based on volume and strategic sales. Other lasers in the marketplace list at $16,000 to over $50,000. Many of these are not mobile and all-in-one units. We believe the benefits to healthcare professionals which include our treatment protocols as well as the additional benefit of additional revenue will make us highly competitive and in high demand in the medical laser industry. For example, although each practitioner can set the rates patients pay for laser treatments, which typically can range from $600 to $2,500 for a 6 treatment package. The prices are set by the healthcare facility taking into consideration the clientele and location of the practice.
 
Benefits of the The Time Machine Program (TMP):
 

● | Offers practitioners a lucrative opportunity to generate new revenues or enhance existing revenue sources with a low-cost device that provided what we believe to be an effective laser medical technology. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brand Awareness
 
The Company plans to develop social media, internet and advertising strategies so as to target medical professionals, as well as their perspective patients. In addition, our Sales Directors will implement and oversees a sales team to increase our exposure to patients and healthcare providers. A major component of the business roll-out strategy will includes industry trade shows, where we believe we will be able to reach a high number of professionals and distribution partners. These conferences will include those in the medical industry, the beauty and spa industry, as well as alternative healthcare practices.
The Market
 
Laser Systems
 
According to Global Industry Analysts Inc., the global market for medical laser systems is forecast to reach US$10 billion by 2020, driven by the aging population’s shift towards minimally invasive procedures, and growing awareness over the safety of laser-based procedures. Other factors driving growth in the market include rise in age related illnesses, increasing consumer spending on non-invasive cosmetic surgeries, developments in Diode Lasers & Fiber Lasers, and expanding applications in cardiology. The United States represents the largest market worldwide.
 
Medical laser systems refer to devices that emit monochromatic light beam in a highly concentrated form for excision of tissues. Lasers are being extensively used for diagnosis and treatment of a number of diseases that were previously difficult to treat or were known to lead to significant complications using traditional procedures. Most common applications of medical laser systems include ophthalmology, oncology, cosmetic surgery, cardiology, dentistry, gynecology, dermatology, gastroenterology, diagnostics and urology. Major factors driving growth in the market include aging population, increasing focus on aesthetics, and growing awareness over the benefits of laser procedures. Rising disposable incomes particularly in developing markets and growing adoption of laser-based treatments are also factors driving growth in the market.
 
Surgical lasers represent the largest product market, supported by developments in diode lasers and fiber lasers, and well-established applications in cardiology. Growing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases is therefore expected to provide sturdy opportunities for growth in the coming years. Advancements in laser technology are resulting in lesser pain and higher surgical accuracy thereby encouraging volume growth in laser procedures. Dedicated lasers with varying active media have been developed to meet specific needs of each procedure. These advancements enable physicians to provide more favorable and noticeable results to patients, with the added benefit of quicker post surgery recovery. Non-invasive methods of body contouring and fat reduction are also gaining popularity, supported by advancements such as Transdermal Focused Ultrasound, Monopolar RF, Low level laser, High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) and Cryolipolysis.
 
Competition
 
Many laser devices and procedures currently used are invasive, which results in the potential of side effects and/or down time (redness, puffiness, swelling) after the laser treatments. Additionally, many of these procedures are very expensive for both the health care professionals that must purchase the expensive laser technology and for the patients paying for procedure costs of the laser treatments. The purchase price of such lasers range from $16,000 to $50,000 (plus) per unit and the laser units are typically big, stationary machines.
 
Because we anticipate the price range of The Time Machine Lasers to be approximately $9,995 or less, each healthcare professional will be paying less than traditionally spend on laser units and will have the flexibility to pass along the lower cost of the machinery onto their patients.
 
We believe, the Time Machine Lasers will be very well received in the Laser Industry as we are not aware of other handheld laser devices for pain that have the capabilities of our TM Lasers.

The industry is subject to intense competition for minimally-invasive and non-invasive procedures. We compete against products and procedures using laser, light-based, RF, ultrasound, and other energy modalities from companies such as Lumix, LiteCure, Apollo, Thor, K-Laser and Aspen.
 
Some of our competitors are also publicly-traded companies and others have longer operating histories than we do. Many of them may enjoy several competitive advantages, including: greater name recognition, more extensive intellectual property protection, established relationships with practitioners and other health care professionals, established domestic and international distribution networks, broader product lines and existing treatment systems, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer higher discounts or incentives, greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval for products and marketing approved products, greater financial resources for product development, sales and marketing and patent litigation. Competition among providers of laser, light-based, ultrasound, and other energy devices is characterized by intensive sales and marketing activities.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our products are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the United States and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, or EU. These governmental authorities regulate the marketing and distribution of medical devices in their respective jurisdictions. The regulations cover the entire life cycle of the product, including the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, packaging, storage, labeling, advertising and promotion of the devices. In addition, post-approval monitoring and reporting, as well as import and export of medical devices, are subject to various regulatory requirements. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, including the EU, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Regulations Relating to Products and Manufacturing
 
Our products and research and development activities are regulated by numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. Any medical device or cosmetic we manufacture and/or distribute will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDCA, and other federal and state laws and regulations govern the pre-clinical and clinical testing, design, manufacture, use, labeling and promotion of medical devices. Product development and approval for medical devices within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources.
 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspensions of production, refusals by the U.S and foreign governments to permit product sales and criminal prosecution.
 
Review and Clearance of Medical Devices in the United States
 
The FDA strictly regulates medical devices in the United States. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, a medical device is defined as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part or accessory, which is, among other things: intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes. Unless an exemption applies, a new medical device may not be marketed in the United States unless it has been cleared by the FDA through filing of a 510(k) premarket notification, or 510(k), or approved by the FDA pursuant to a premarket approval application, or PMA. Both premarket notifications and premarket approval applications, when submitted to the FDA, must be accompanied by a user fee, unless exempt.

The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes depending on the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Class I devices have the lowest level or risk associated with them, and are subject to general controls, including labeling, premarket notification and adherence to the QSR. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards. Class III devices, which have the highest level of risk associated with them, are subject to most of the aforementioned requirements as well as to premarket approval. Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempt from the 510(k) requirement, although manufacturers of these devices are still subject to registration, listing, labeling and QSR requirements.
 
510(k) Premarket Notification
 
A 510(k) is a premarket submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that the proposed device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective (i.e., substantially equivalent) to another legally marketed device, or predicate device, that did not require premarket approval. In evaluating a 510(k), the FDA will determine whether the device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and (a) has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device, or (b) has different technological characteristics, and (1) the data supporting substantial equivalence contains information, including appropriate clinical or scientific data, if deemed necessary by the FDA, that demonstrates that the device is as safe and as effective as a legally marketed device, and (2) does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device. Most 510(k)s do not require clinical data for clearance, but the FDA may request such data.
 
The FDA seeks to review and act on a 510(k) within 90 days of submission, but it may take longer if the agency finds that it requires more information to review the 510(k). If the FDA concludes that a new device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the new device will be classified in Class III and the manufacturer will be required to submit a PMA to market the product. With the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or the FDASIA, a de novo pathway is directly available for certain low to moderate risk devices that do not qualify for the 510(k) pathway due to the absence of a predicate device.
 
Healthcare Law and Regulation
 
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors may play a role in the recommendation and selection of medical devices for patients. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:

● | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the Civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. 
● | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;

● | The federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing ·or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 
● | Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. 

 
State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Patents, Proprietary Technology and Trademarks
 
Our success may depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our in-licensed products, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to try to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign trademark applications, and, when it becomes applicable, patent applications related to proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. However, currently, our rights to our proprietary technology are in-licensed rights and not a technology that we could directly patent. We also rely on trademarks, trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. These legal protections afford only limited protection for our technology. We currently own the trademark for “The Time Machine Program”.
