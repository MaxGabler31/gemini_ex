Item 1.   Business
Overview
We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research, development and commercialization of innovative immunotherapies to treat cancer. Our strategy is to build a leading immuno-oncology franchise funded with cash generated through net sales of our diversified portfolio of FDA-approved therapeutics.

We in-licensed our lead immuno-oncology product candidate, toripalimab (CHS-007), a novel anti-PD-1 antibody, from Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co., Ltd. (“Junshi Biosciences”) in February 2021. The FDA has granted Priority Review for the toripalimab BLA, as well as Breakthrough Therapy Designation for toripalimab for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (“NPC”) and set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) action date for April 30, 2022. Toripalimab is being evaluated in late-stage clinical trials for the treatment of a broad range of tumor types including cancers of the lung, nasopharynx, esophagus, stomach, bladder, breast, liver, kidney and skin. Within the next several years, if toripalimab is approved, we anticipate submitting BLA supplements for multiple additional cancer indications. 
We have also acquired options to license two pipeline immuno-oncology product candidates from Junshi Biosciences, a clinical stage anti-TIGIT antibody (“JS006”) and a next-generation engineered IL-2 cytokine, for potential evaluation in combination with toripalimab. In January 2022, we initiated the process to exercise the option to license JS006, the TIGIT-targeted antibody, in the United States and Canada. We will lead further development of JS006 and will be responsible for the associated development costs as set forth in the Collaboration Agreement. Antibodies blocking TIGIT (T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain) have shown potential for enhanced anti-tumor activity in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. In preclinical studies, JS006 demonstrated strong binding affinity and inhibition of the TIGIT pathway. A dose escalation, dose expansion clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier# NCT05061628) evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties of JS006 as monotherapy and in combination with PD-1 inhibitor toripalimab in patients with advanced solid tumors is ongoing in China. The FDA has cleared an investigational new drug application (“IND”) allowing clinical trials of JS006 in the United States, and we plan to advance toripalimab in combination with JS006 in a clinical trial in North America later in 2022.
We are also developing an internal immuno-oncology pipeline leveraging our demonstrated expertise in preclinical and translational science, bioinformatics, analytical characterization, process science engineering, and clinical-regulatory development and commercialization. Our preclinical pipeline includes antibodies that are designed to address immune suppression in the tumor micro-environment, enhance the anti-tumor activity of toripalimab and potentially improve clinical benefit for cancer patients. We expect to submit an IND to the FDA for the first of these programs in 2023.
Our commercial portfolio includes two FDA-approved biologics. Our first product, UDENYCA® (pegfilgrastim-cbqv), a biosimilar to Neulasta®, a long-acting granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, was launched commercially in the United States in January 2019. In December 2021, the FDA-approved YUSIMRY™ (adalimumab-aqvh), formerly CHS-1420, our Humira® (adalimumab) biosimilar product, which we plan to launch in the United States on or after July 1, 2023, per the terms of an agreement with Humira manufacturer, AbbVie Inc. (“AbbVie”). In addition to our two FDA-approved biologics, we also have two additional product candidates in the late stage of review with the FDA, toripalimab and CIMERLI™ (ranibizumab-ranq injection), a Lucentis® (ranibizumab) biosimilar candidate. The PDUFA action date for the toripalimab BLA is April 30, 2022, and if approved, we are planning to launch toripalimab in the United States following approval. In 2021, our partner, Bioeq, submitted to the FDA a BLA for CIMERLI. The FDA has accepted the application for filing and set a target action date of August 2022. If approved, we expect CIMERLI commercial launch following approval, depending on importation timing with United States Customs. We are also conducting a pharmacokinetic study to facilitate a potential biosimilar application (“Section 351(k) BLA”) seeking FDA approval for CHS-305, an Avastin® (bevacizumab) biosimilar candidate. We have built an experienced and robust oncology market access, key account management and medical affairs capability in the United States, supporting the successful commercialization of UDENYCA. We expect to leverage these capabilities as we build and launch our immuno-oncology franchise.
In January 2022, we entered into a loan agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with BioPharma Credit PLC, (as the “Collateral Agent”), BPCR Limited Partnership, (as a “Lender”) and Biopharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, acting by its general partner, BioPharma Credit Investments V GP LLC (as a “Lender”) that provides for a senior secured term loan facility of up to $400.0 million (inclusive of a $100.0 million uncommitted additional facility amount) to be funded in four committed tranches: (i) a Tranche A Loan in an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million (the “Tranche A Loan”) that was funded on January 5, 2022 (the “Tranche A Closing Date”); (ii) a Tranche B Loan in an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million (the “Tranche B Loan”) to be funded no later than April 1, 2022, subject to the delivery 

3



of evidence of repayment, repurchase or redemption of indebtedness outstanding under our 8.2% Senior Convertible Notes due March 2022 and certain customary deliverables; (iii) a Tranche C Loan in an aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the “Tranche C Loan”) to be funded at our option between April 1, 2022 and March 17, 2023, subject to certain conditions including the first FDA approval of a BLA for our product candidate toripalimab in the United States; and (iv) a Tranche D Loan in an aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the “Tranche D Loan” and, together with the Tranche A Loan, the Tranche B Loan, and the Tranche C Loan, the “2027 Term Loans”) to be funded at our option between April 1, 2022 and March 17, 2023, subject to certain conditions including the first FDA approval of a BLA for our product candidate CHS-201 (ranibizumab biosimilar) in the United States. We have the right to request an uncommitted additional facility amount of up to $100.0 million after the Tranche A Closing Date that will be subject to new terms and conditions.
The 2027 Term Loans mature on either (i) the fifth anniversary of the Tranche A Closing Date; or (ii) October 15, 2025, if the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 1.5% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2026 is greater than $50.0 million on October 1, 2025 (the “Maturity Date”). The 2027 Term Loans bear interest at 8.25% plus three-month LIBOR per annum with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%. In the event of the cessation of LIBOR, the benchmark governing the interest rate will be replaced with a rate based on the secured overnight financing rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as described in the Loan Agreement. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. Repayment of outstanding principal of the 2027 Term Loans will be made in five equal quarterly payments of principal commencing after the 48-month anniversary of the Tranche A Closing Date.
Products and Product Candidates
Our portfolio includes the following products and product candidates:
Oncology

● | Toripalimab is being developed for its ability to block PD-1 interactions with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2 by binding to the FG loop of PD-1, and for enhanced PD-1 receptor internalization (endocytosis function). We believe blocking PD-1 interactions with PD-L1 and PD-L2 can help to promote the immune system’s ability to attack and kill tumor cells. More than thirty company-sponsored toripalimab clinical studies covering more than fifteen indications have been conducted globally by our partner Junshi Biosciences, including in China, the United States, Southeast Asia, and European countries.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Together with Junshi Biosciences, in the third quarter of 2021 we completed the submission of the toripalimab BLA to the FDA seeking approval for the use of toripalimab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for first-line treatment of adults with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced NPC, and for use as a monotherapy in the second- or later-line treatment of patients with recurrent unresectable or metastatic NPC that have progressed on or after a platinum-containing chemotherapy and the FDA granted the BLA Priority Review with a target action date of April 30, 2022. We believe there is a high unmet need in NPC based on the current FDA-approved treatment alternatives and the lack of any approved immunotherapies.
​
The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to toripalimab for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic NPC with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy and for toripalimab in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin) for the first line treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC. The FDA has also granted toripalimab Fast Track designation for the treatment of mucosal melanoma and orphan drug designations for treatment of NPC, mucosal melanoma soft tissue sarcoma, and esophageal cancer. 
​
In addition to NPC, we plan to submit supplemental BLAs to the FDA to toripalimab within the next two years for the treatment of rare and highly prevalent cancers.
​

● | JS006 is an investigational recombinant humanized IgG4κ monoclonal antibody designed to act specifically against human TIGIT. A number of preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that activation of the TIGIT pathway could be a crucial underlying mechanism for tumor immune evasion and resistance to PD-1 blockade therapy. Combination of TIGIT and PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies showed a synergistic potential to enhance antitumor response, to overcome anti-PD-1 resistance and possibly broaden the cancer patient population that can benefit from immunotherapy.

advanced solid tumors is ongoing in China. The FDA has cleared an IND allowing clinical trials of JS006 in the United States, and we plan to advance toripalimab in combination with JS006 in a clinical trial in North America later in 2022. 
​

● | UDENYCA is a biosimilar to Neulasta, a long-acting granulocyte colony stimulating factor (“G-CSF”). We launched UDENYCA commercially in the United States in January 2019 following approval by the FDA in November 2018. In 2021 we recorded net sales of UDENYCA of $326.6 million. We are also developing an additional presentation of UDENYCA: a proprietary on-body injector (“OBI”), in addition to the currently marketed pre-filled syringe (“PFS”) presentation. In October 2021, we announced positive results from a randomized, open-label, crossover study assessing the pharmacokinetic (“PK”) and pharmacodynamic bioequivalence of UDENYCA administered via OBI compared to UDENYCA PFS. We are planning a 2022 submission to the FDA of a prior approval supplement to seek marketing authorization for the UDENYCA OBI.

● | CHS-305, a bevacizumab (Avastin) biosimilar candidate. In January 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Innovent Biologics (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. (“Innovent,” and with respect to the license agreement with Innovent, the “Innovent Agreement”) for the development and commercialization of a biosimilar version of bevacizumab (Avastin) in any dosage form and presentations (“bevacizumab Licensed Product”) in the United States and Canada. We are conducting a three-way PK study using Avastin drug products from the United States, Avastin drug products from China and Innovent’s biosimilar to bevacizumab, as well additional analytical similarity exercises. We, together with our partner Innovent, are assessing the commercial feasibility of CHS-305.

Immunology

● | YUSIMRY (adalimumab-aqvh), is a biosimilar of Humira, a monoclonal antibody that can bind to tumor necrosis factor ("TNF"). YUSIMRY provides certain therapeutic benefits for treatment of patients with certain inflammatory diseases characterized by increased production of TNF in the body, including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn’s disease, psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. In December 2021, the FDA approved YUSIMRY, which we plan to launch in the United States on or after July 1, 2023, per the terms of an agreement with Humira manufacturer, AbbVie Inc.

● | CIMERLI, formerly known as CHS-201, a ranibizumab (Lucentis) biosimilar candidate. In November 2019, we entered into a license agreement with Bioeq for the commercialization of CHS-201, a biosimilar version of ranibizumab (Lucentis) in certain dosage forms in both a vial and PFS presentation. Under this agreement, Bioeq granted to us an exclusive royalty-bearing license to commercialize CHS-201 in the field of ophthalmology (and any other approved labelled indication) in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bioeq submitted a Section 351(k) BLA for CIMERLI to the FDA in the third quarter of 2021. The FDA has accepted the CIMERLI BLA for review and assigned an August 2022 target action date.
Market Opportunity for our Oncology Franchise
Toripalimab Opportunity
In February 2021, we acquired exclusive rights in the United States and Canada for the co-development and commercialization of Junshi Biosciences’ toripalimab, a PD-1 blocking antibody. Total anti-PD-L1 antibody United States annual revenues in 2021 were approximately $18.0 billion and are projected to grow to approximately $25.0 billion by 2025. Non-small cell lung cancer accounted for approximately 40% of all anti-PD-L1 antibody United States revenues in 2021 and is expected to remain the largest tumor segment in the foreseeable future.
Immuno-oncology agents, and the PD-1/PD-L1 class in particular, have shifted the treatment paradigm across a broad range of tumors, and across the continuum of cancer settings (metastatic to early stage). Clinical adoption of PD-1/PD-L1 therapies has been driven by the proven versatility of certain therapies within the class to be used as a monotherapy, as well as combination therapy with targeted agents such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, chemotherapy, or other immunotherapy agents to achieve durable tumor responses and 

5



improved survival benefits, with acceptable toxicity profiles. The improved safety profile observed for approved PD-L1 therapies versus chemotherapy, enables these therapies to be used as a backbone therapy in a broad array of combination regimens.
UDENYCA Biosimilar
UDENYCA is a biosimilar to Neulasta, a long-acting granulocyte stimulating colony factor. We initiated United States sales of UDENYCA in January 2019, and in 2021 we recorded net sales of $326.6 million. According to Evaluate Pharma, the 2021 United States net sales for all pegfilgrastim products represented an estimated $2.1 billion. UDENYCA is currently approved by the FDA in a PFS presentation. PFS products currently account for approximately 50% of the overall pegfilgrastim market. The remaining 50% is held by Neulasta Onpro®, an OBI presentation of pegfilgrastim owned by Amgen Inc. and Amgen USA Inc. (collectively “Amgen”). We plan to submit a prior approval supplement seeking marketing authorization for our OBI presentation of UDENYCA. If approved, an OBI presentation could potentially expand the UDENYCA market opportunity to the remaining pegfilgrastim market.
Bevacizumab (Avastin) Biosimilar
In January 2020, we acquired the right to commercialize Innovent’s Avastin biosimilar candidate in the United States and Canada. Avastin is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds circulating vascular endothelial growth factor (“VEGF”), thereby inhibiting the binding of VEGF to its cell surface receptors. This inhibition leads to a reduction in microvascular growth of tumor blood vessels and thus limits the blood supply to various types of tumor tissues. Avastin was first approved in 2004 by the FDA for combination use with standard chemotherapy for metastatic colon cancer for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic kidney cancer, advanced cervical cancer, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and recurrent glioblastoma.
United States net sales for Avastin and Avastin biosimilars were reported to be approximately $2 billion in 2021. 
JS006 Opportunity 
In January 2022, we initiated the process for the exercise of our option to license JS006, a TIGIT-targeted antibody, in the United States and Canada from Junshi Biosciences, expanding our 2021 immuno-oncology collaboration agreement. TIGIT-targeted antibodies have emerged as a promising novel immuno-oncology agent that can potentially be used in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 agents and have the potential to improve upon the durable clinical antitumor activity of current PD-1/PD-L1 regimens. Moreover, a TIGIT-targeted antibody and PD-1/PD-L1 combination, if successfully developed and approved, could be practice changing in numerous tumor settings by providing a chemotherapy free option, potentially improving upon the safety profile of current regimens. Our current hypothesis is that the TIGIT class of agents could be effective in the same tumor types and settings where PD-1/PD-L1 therapies have proven efficacy, but with a potentially better safety profile than chemotherapy containing PD-1/PD-L1 regimens, and as such, the market potential for this class of agents could be as large, or larger, than that of PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. 
Immunology Franchise Market Opportunity
YUSIMRY
YUSIMRY is a biosimilar of Humira, a monoclonal antibody that can bind to TNF, thereby inhibiting the known effect of this substance as a potent mediator of inflammation. YUSIMRY thus provides certain therapeutic benefits for treatment of patients with certain inflammatory diseases characterized by increased production of TNF in the body, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn’s disease, psoriasis and ulcerative colitis.
United States net revenues of Humira were reported by AbbVie to be approximately $17.3 billion in 2021. Our settlement and license agreements with AbbVie grant us global, non-exclusive worldwide rights under AbbVie’s intellectual property to manufacture and commercialize YUSIMRY starting on July 1, 2023.

Ophthalmology Franchise Market Opportunity
CIMERLI 
In November 2019, we in-licensed United States commercial rights to Bioeq’s ranibizumab (Lucentis) biosimilar. Lucentis is a monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab) created from the same parent mouse antibody as bevacizumab and produced through a microbial culture. It blocks angiogenesis by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor A. Lucentis is approved in the United States for indications including wet AMD, macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, and diabetic retinopathy.
United States net revenues of Lucentis were reported by F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. (“Roche”) to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2021. 
Deprioritized pipeline programs
We are currently seeking strategic alternatives for CHS-131, a PPARγ small molecule clinical candidate being evaluated for the treatment of NASH. 
In February 2021, we announced discontinuation of the development of CHS-2020, a biosimilar of Eylea® as part of a realignment of research and development resources toward the development of immuno-oncology assets including toripalimab.
Sales and Marketing
Our strategy is to build a leading immuno-oncology franchise funded with cash generated through net sales of our diversified portfolio of FDA-approved therapeutics. 
If we are successful in gaining approval of toripalimab and our other immuno-oncology assets or of our bevacizumab biosimilar, we believe we have the potential to efficiently integrate these new products into our existing oncology commercial infrastructure. For example, we project that our current field footprint is sufficiently organized to successfully launch toripalimab, if approved, in NPC and can scale as needed as new indications are approved. 
Similarly, for our ophthalmology franchise, we anticipate that the number of accounts to drive 90% of sales volume is approximately one-third that of the oncology supportive care market. As a result, we anticipate a relatively small incremental investment in additional sales force will be needed to address the ophthalmology marketplace. 
For the expected launch of CIMERLI, if approved, we intend to build a dedicated sales and key account team who will focus on the approximately 3,000 retinal specialists practicing in the United States today. Market access support will come from our existing payor and field reimbursement managers, and our Coherus Complete® patient services hub will scale to support the needs of CIMERLI customers. 
For the planned launch of YUSIMRY, we believe that payor coverage policies and formularies will dictate provider access to both Humira and adalimumab biosimilars and that a combination of factors will influence formulary decision making. Examples of these include but are not limited to, list price, discounts and rebates, product formulation, supply guarantees, and timing of market entry. We intend to leverage our deep and established commercial experience in market segmentation, pricing and contracting, market access (dedicated payor team, key account teams, field-based reimbursement specialists, and Coherus Complete patient services HUB) to compete upon market entry. We are also scaling our digital and remote-based selling capabilities in order to drive share of voice and product pull-though in markets where formulary acceptance is achieved. 
For a discussion of risks related to sales and marketing, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Launch and Commercialization of our Products and our Product Candidates.” 
Manufacturing
We have entered into agreements with several contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) for the manufacture and clinical drug supply of our commercial and products candidates. We continue to screen other contract manufacturers to meet our clinical, commercial and regulatory supply requirements on a product-by-product basis. For a discussion of risks related to our sources and

availability of supplies, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Ability to Hire and Retain Highly Qualified Personnel and Risks Related to Manufacturing and Supply Chain.”
Competition
While we believe that our biologics platform, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Such competition includes larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, generic pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies commercializing and developing immuno-oncology and biosimilar products that would compete with our products and the product candidates in our pipeline. 
Toripalimab, if approved, will enter a competitive market in the United States where a number of anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody drugs have been approved by the FDA including the following marketed products from several competitors: Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) from Merck & Company, Inc. (“Merck”), Opdivo® (nivolumab) from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (“BMS”), Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) from Genentech, Inc. (“Genentech”), Imfinzi® (durvalumab) from AstraZeneca plc (“AstraZeneca”), Bavencio® (avelumab) from EMD Serono Inc. and Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”), and Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc) from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Regeneron”) and Sanofi S.A. (“Sanofi”), and Jemperli (dostarlimab-gxly) from GlaxoSmithKline plc (“GlaxoSmithKline”). In addition to toripalimab, multiple other competitors are seeking to develop and approve novel anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody drugs in the United States in the coming years, including but not limited to BeiGene, Ltd. (in collaboration with Novartis International AG (“Novartis”)), GlaxoSmithKline and Innovent (in collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company (“Eli Lilly”)).
UDENYCA faces competition in the United States from Amgen, Viatris Inc. (“Viatris”), Mylan N.V. (“Mylan”), Sandoz International GmbH (“Sandoz”), and Pfizer, and may face competition from Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Amneal”), Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA (“Fresenius”) and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Spectrum”) each of which has announced the development of a pegfilgrastim biosimilar.
YUSIMRY, following our planned launch, may face competition in the United States from AbbVie (the holder of rights to Humira), Amgen (AmjevitaTM (adalimumab-atto)), Sandoz (HyrimozTM (adalimumab-adaz)), Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd. (“Samsung Bioepis”) (HadlimaTM (adalimumab-bwwd)), Pfizer (AbriladaTM (adalimumab-afzb)), Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH (“Boehringer Ingelheim”) (CyltezoTM (adalimumab-adbm)) as well as Viatris / Biocon (“Biocon”) (Hulio® (adalimumab-fkjp)), Alvotech Holdings S.A. and Fresenius, each a company that has disclosed development plans for a Humira biosimilar candidate.
Innovent’s bevacizumab (Avastin) biosimilar candidate, if approved, may face competition in the United States from Genentech, the holder of rights to Avastin, as well as Amgen (MvasiTM (bevacizumab-awwb)) and Pfizer (ZirabevTM (bevacizumab-bvzr)), each of which have initiated the commercial launch of an Avastin biosimilar. We may also face competition from several other companies with Avastin biosimilar candidates in development or in registration, including Sandoz (BAT1706), Celltrion, Inc. (CT-P16), Amneal (AlymsysTM), Organon & Co. (Aybintio SB8-biosimilar-bevacizumab) and Viatris.
CIMERLI, if approved, may face competition in the United States from Roche/Genentech (the manufacturer of Lucentis, Vabysmo and SusvimoTM). Biogen Inc. (“Biogen”) with collaborator Samsung Bioepis, and Xbrane Biopharma AB (“Xbrane”) (in collaboration with STADA Arzneimittel AG (“STADA”) and Bausch & Lomb Incorporated (“Bausch & Lomb”)) have each disclosed the development of a Lucentis biosimilar candidate.
We expect any products that we develop and commercialize directly or with partners to compete on the basis of, among other things, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. For a discussion of risks related to our competition, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Competitive Activity.”

We paid Bioeq an upfront payment of €5.0 million and a milestone payment of €5.0 million in 2019. Additionally, following milestone target dates that expired on or prior to December 31, 2021, our obligation to pay Bioeq milestone payments in connection with the achievement of such development and regulatory milestones with respect to the Bioeq Licensed Products in the United States reduced from an aggregate of up to €25.0 million to €12.5 million. We will share a percentage of gross profits on sales of Bioeq Licensed Products in the United States with Bioeq in the low to mid fifty percent range.
​
The Bioeq Agreement’s initial term continues in effect for ten years after the first commercial sale of a Bioeq Licensed Product in the United States, and thereafter renews for an unlimited period of time unless otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms. Either party may terminate the Bioeq Agreement for the other party’s material breach which is not cured within a specified time period or for the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency-related events. Bioeq may terminate the Bioeq Agreement in certain limited circumstances for failure to obtain specified minimum market share requirements during certain windows of time, if we conduct certain commercial or advanced pre-commercial activities with respect to certain competitive products, if we challenge the validity or enforceability of the patent rights licensed to us under the Bioeq Agreement, or if we undergo a change of control with a competitor of Bioeq and do not divest certain competitive products in connection therewith. We may terminate the Bioeq Agreement for convenience with 18 months advance written notice (provided that such termination shall not become effective prior to 12 months after the first commercial sale of the first Bioeq Licensed Product in the United States). We may also terminate the Bioeq Agreement in certain circumstances of delays, or anticipated delays, in the achievement of regulatory approval of the first Bioeq Licensed Product in the United States, or if Bioeq receives certain adverse regulatory feedback from the FDA for the Bioeq Licensed Products.
CIMERLI demonstrated similar binding and bioactivity as ranibizumab (Lucentis) and met its primary endpoint in a wet AMD Phase 3 study. At the request of a national European health authority addressed to Bioeq’s drug substance contract manufacturer, the manufacturer moved a piece of processing equipment to a different location within the same site after the production of the Bioeq ranibizumab biosimilar candidate qualification batches was completed. In February 2020, the FDA requested additional manufacturing data for the equipment in its new location in the context of its review of the Section 351(k) BLA, and Bioeq withdrew its BLA. During the first quarter of 2021, Bioeq received pre-BLA feedback from the FDA on the requested manufacturing data, and Bioeq subsequently resubmitted its Section 351(k) BLA during 2021 which the FDA accepted for filing in October 2021. The FDA has set a Biosimilar User Fee Act action date for August 2, 2022, and, if approved, we plan to launch CIMERLI in the United States in 2022.
​
License Agreement with Innovent
In January 2020, we entered into the Innovent Agreement for the development and commercialization of a biosimilar version of bevacizumab (Avastin) in any dosage form and presentations (the “bevacizumab Licensed Product”) in the United States and Canada (the “Territory”). Under the Innovent Agreement, Innovent granted us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize the bevacizumab Licensed Product in the field of treatment, prevention or amelioration of any human diseases and conditions as included in the label of Avastin. We also acquired an option for twelve months to develop and commercialize Innovent’s biosimilar version of rituximab (Rituxan®) in any dosage form and presentations (the “rituximab Licensed Product” and together with the bevacizumab Licensed Product, the “Innovent Licensed Products”) in the Territory. Subject to the terms of the Innovent Agreement, we may exercise our option within 12 months of receiving certain regulatory materials from Innovent. Following our option exercise, Innovent’s biosimilar version of rituximab would be deemed an Innovent Licensed Product and Innovent would grant us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize Innovent’s biosimilar version of rituximab in the field of treatment, prevention or amelioration of any human diseases and conditions as included in the label of Rituxan.

Innovent will supply the Innovent Licensed Products to us in accordance with a manufacturing and supply agreement to be executed by the parties. Under the Innovent Agreement, we acquired the right to require Innovent to perform technology transfer for the manufacturing of the Innovent Licensed Products in the Territory and, upon completion of such technology transfer, we will have the exclusive right to manufacture the Innovent Licensed Products in the Territory.
We paid Innovent an upfront payment of $5.0 million and a milestone payment of $2.5 million in 2020. Additionally, we are obligated to pay Innovent an aggregate of up to $37.5 million in milestone payments in connection with the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestones with respect to the bevacizumab Licensed Product and, if we exercise our option to license Innovent’s rituximab biosimilar, an aggregate of up to $40.0 million in milestone payments in connection with the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestones with respect to the rituximab Licensed Product. We will share a percentage of net sales of Innovent Licensed Products with Innovent in the mid-teens to low twenty percent range. If we exercise our option, we would be required to pay an option exercise fee of $5.0 million. Subject to the terms of the Innovent Agreement, if we request Innovent to perform technology transfer for the manufacturing of the Innovent Licensed Products, we would be required to pay up to $10.0 million for fees related thereto.
For the bevacizumab Licensed Product, the initial term continues in effect for ten years after the effective date of the Innovent Agreement, and thereafter renews for successive two-year periods upon mutual agreement by the parties, unless otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms. For the rituximab Licensed Product, the initial term would continue in effect for ten years after the effective date of the option effective date and thereafter would renew for successive two-year periods upon mutual agreement by the parties, unless otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms. Either party may terminate the Innovent Agreement for the other party’s material breach that is not cured within a specified time period or for the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency-related events. Innovent may terminate the Innovent Agreement if we undergo a change of control with a competitor of Innovent and does not assign the Innovent Agreement to a third party within a certain period of time. On an Innovent Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis, we may terminate the Innovent Agreement based on certain market conditions beginning 12 months after the first commercial sale of such Innovent Licensed Product with 18 months advance written notice. Also on an Innovent Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis, we may terminate the Innovent Agreement in certain circumstances of delays, or anticipated delays, in the achievement of regulatory approval of such Innovent Licensed Product in the United States, if we receive certain adverse regulatory feedback from the FDA for such Innovent Licensed Product, or if we receive written FDA meeting minutes indicating that the FDA recommends an additional Phase 3 clinical trial efficacy comparability study to support the regulatory approval of such Innovent Licensed Product in the United States. The bevacizumab Licensed Product demonstrated PK bioequivalence and showed equivalent clinical efficacy to Avastin in a non-small cell lung carcinoma Phase 3 study.
License Agreement with Junshi Biosciences
On February 1, 2021, we entered into an Exclusive License and Commercialization Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Junshi Biosciences for the co-development and commercialization of toripalimab, Junshi Biosciences’ anti-PD-1 antibody in the United States and Canada (the “Collaboration”). 
Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, we paid $150.0 million upfront for exclusive rights to toripalimab in the United States and Canada, options in these territories to Junshi Biosciences’ anti-TIGIT antibody JS006 and next-generation engineered IL-2 cytokine, and certain negotiation rights to two undisclosed preclinical immuno-oncology drug candidates. We will have the right to conduct all commercial activities of toripalimab in the United States and Canada. We will be obligated to pay Junshi Biosciences a 20% royalty on net sales of toripalimab and up to an aggregate $380.0 million in one-time payments for the achievement of various regulatory and sales milestones. 
In January 2022, we took steps that we expect will result in the payment to Junshi Biosciences of an additional $35.0 million upon the closing of the exercise of our option to license JS006, a TIGIT-targeted antibody, in the United States and Canada. We will lead further development of JS006 and will be responsible for the associated development costs as set forth in the Collaboration Agreement. If we exercise our remaining option for the IL-2 cytokine, we will be obligated to pay an option exercise fee of $35.0 million. Additionally, for each exercised option, we will be obligated to pay Junshi Biosciences an 18% royalty on net sales and up to an aggregate $255.0 million for the achievement of various milestones, including up to $170.0 million for attainment of certain sales thresholds. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we retain the right to collaborate in the development of toripalimab and the other licensed compounds and will pay for a portion of these co-development activities up to a maximum of $25.0 million per licensed compound per year. Additionally, we are responsible for certain associated regulatory and technology transfer costs for toripalimab and other licensed compounds and will reimburse Junshi Biosciences for such costs. We recognized research and development expense of $39.4 million in the consolidated 

11



statement of operations for year ended December 31, 2021, and had $1.9 million recorded in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 related to the co-development, regulatory and technology transfer costs. 
We accounted for the licensing transaction as an asset acquisition under the relevant accounting rules. We recorded research and development expense of $145.0 million during the first quarter of 2021, related to an upfront payment for exclusive rights to toripalimab in the United States and Canada. We had entered into a Right of First Negotiation agreement with Junshi Biosciences and paid a fee of $5.0 million which was expensed as research and development expense in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Right of First Negotiation fee was fully credited against the total upfront license fee obligation under the Collaboration Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, we did not have any outstanding milestone or royalty payment obligations to Junshi Biosciences. The $35.0 million payment for the option to license JS006 will be reflected in our first quarter 2022 financial statements. The additional milestone payments, option fees and royalties are contingent upon future events and, therefore, will be recorded when it is probable that a milestone will be achieved, option fees will be incurred or when royalties are due.
In connection with the Collaboration Agreement, we entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Junshi Biosciences agreeing, subject to customary conditions, to acquire certain equity interests in the Company. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, on April 16, 2021, we issued 2,491,988 unregistered shares of our common stock to Junshi Biosciences, at a price per share of $20.0643, for an aggregate value of approximately $50.0 million cash. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Junshi Biosciences is not permitted to sell, transfer, make any short sale of, or grant any option for the sale of the common stock for the two years period following its effective date. The Collaboration Agreement and the Stock Purchase Agreement were negotiated concurrently and were therefore evaluated as a single agreement. We used the “Finnerty” and “Asian put” valuation models and determined the fair value for the discount for lack of marketability (“DLOM”) to be $9.0 million at the date the shares were issued. The fair value of the DLOM was attributable to the Collaboration Agreement and was included as an offset against the research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Additionally, our commercial success may depend on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our technologies where applicable and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies by, among other methods, filing United States and international patent applications on these technologies, inventions and improvements that are important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date.
In the normal course of business, we pursue patent protection for inventions related to our product candidates. Each patent family includes United States patent applications and/or issued patents, and some include foreign counterparts to certain of the United States patents and patent applications. Our patent portfolio includes issued or pending claims directed to formulations, methods of manufacturing biological proteins, and drug products and devices, including their methods of use and methods of manufacture.
For a discussion of risks related to our proprietary technology and processes, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
Government Regulation
Our operations and activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States, the E.U. and other countries, including laws and regulations governing the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. As a result of these regulations, product development and product approval processes are very expensive and time consuming. The regulatory requirements applicable to drug development and approval are subject 

12



to change. Any legal and regulatory changes may impact our operations in the future. A country’s regulatory agency, such as the FDA in the United States and the EMA or the European Commission for the E.U., must approve a drug before it can be sold in the respective country or countries. The general process for biosimilar approval in the United States is summarized below. Many other countries, including countries in the E.U., have similar regulatory structures.
FDA Approval Process for Drugs and Biologics
Our current product candidates are subject to regulation in the United States by the FDA as biological products or as drug product candidates. The FDA subjects drugs and biologics to extensive pre- and post-market regulation pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”) and its implementing regulations, and in the case of biologics, the FFDCA and the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) and their implementing regulations. In addition, we are subject to other federal and state statutes and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of drugs and biologics. Failure to comply with applicable United States requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve a pending BLA or NDA, withdrawal of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a new biologic or drug may be marketed in the United States is long, expensive and inherently uncertain. Biologic and drug development in the United States typically involves the completion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests in accordance with good laboratory practices (“GLP”), the submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, the performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the biologic or drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought in compliance with good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements, the submission to the FDA of an original BLA under Section 351(a) of the PHSA (“original BLA”) or an NDA, as appropriate, satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug or biologic is produced, and FDA approval and review of the original BLA or NDA. Developing the data to satisfy FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug or biologic to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies, although the IND must also include the results of preclinical testing and animal testing assessing the toxicology, PK, pharmacology and PD characteristics of the product along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
An IND must become effective before United States clinical trials may begin. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If during the 30-day waiting period the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical studies, the sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical studies can begin. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug or biologic to healthy volunteers or patients with the condition under investigation, all under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCP requirements, which are designed to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on United States patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
Human clinical trials for novel drugs and biologics are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined.

● | Phase 1—The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some therapeutic candidates for severe or life-
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13




threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product candidate may be inherently to toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2—Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3—Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of such “Phase 4” clinical trials.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (“IRB”), for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or may impose other conditions. The study sponsor may also suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a determination that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies, develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the product candidate. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. Additionally, for both NDA and BLA products, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life.
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed information regarding the investigational product is submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA or NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA or NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. Under the PDUFA as amended, each original BLA or NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, such as where a waiver is necessary to protect the public health, where the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation, or where the applicant is a small business submitting its first human therapeutic application for review.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews an original BLA or NDA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any original BLA or NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, and may request additional information. In this event, the original BLA or NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the original BLA or NDA. The FDA reviews the original BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and in the case of an NDA, whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use, and in each case, whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that 

14



present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for Priority Review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. A BLA or NDA is eligible for Priority Review if the product if the product candidate has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition compared to marketed products. In both standard and Priority Reviews, the review process may also be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS plan is needed, the sponsor of the original BLA or NDA must submit a proposed REMS plan. The FDA will not approve an original BLA or NDA without a REMS plan, if required. In determining whether a REMS plan is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug or biologic, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug or biologic, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug or biologic is a new molecular entity. A REMS plan may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug or biologic, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug or biologic. In addition, the REMS plan must include a timetable to assess the strategy at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the strategy’s approval.
The FDA will not approve the application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an original BLA or NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. After the FDA evaluates an original BLA or NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional clinical trial or trials, and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical trials or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the original BLA or NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Abbreviated Licensure Pathway of Biological Products as Biosimilar under Section 351(k)
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”), amended the PHSA and created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The BPCIA attempts to minimize duplicative testing and thereby lower development costs and increase patient access to affordable treatments. Thus, an application for licensure of a biosimilar product pursuant to a Section 351(k) BLA must include information demonstrating biosimilarity based upon the following, unless the FDA determines otherwise:

● | analytical studies demonstrating that the proposed biosimilar product is highly similar to the approved product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | two clinical study phases: first, a clinical study or studies (generally termed “Phase 1”) that demonstrate the PK and PD similarity (e.g., bioequivalence study) of the proposed biosimilar to the originator molecule, and second, a clinical study or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15




studies (generally termed “Phase 3”) that demonstrate the safety (including immunogenicity), purity and that potency is statistically not inferior to that of the originator in one or more conditions for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, an application submitted under the Section 351(k) pathway must include information demonstrating that:

● | the proposed biosimilar product and reference product utilize the same mechanism of action for the condition(s) of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling, but only to the extent the mechanism(s) of action are known for the reference product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the labeling for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the route of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the proposed biosimilar product are the same as those for the reference product; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure and potent.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Biosimilarity is defined to mean that the proposed biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. In addition, a biosimilar may also be determined to be “interchangeable” with the reference products, whereby the biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. The higher standard of interchangeability must be demonstrated by information sufficient to show that:

● | the proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | the proposed product is expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | for a product that is administered more than once to an individual, the risk to the patient in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the biosimilar and the reference product is no greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FDA approval is required before a biosimilar may be marketed in the United States. The FDA has discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidence — laboratory, preclinical and/or clinical — required to demonstrate biosimilarity to a licensed biological product. The FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence, provided by a sponsor to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, and recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach in the development of their biosimilar products. Biosimilar product applications thus may not be required to duplicate the entirety of preclinical and clinical testing used to establish the underlying safety and effectiveness of the reference product. However, the FDA may refuse to approve a biosimilar application if there is insufficient information to show that the active ingredients are the same or to demonstrate that any impurities or differences in active ingredients do not affect the safety, purity or potency of the biosimilar product. In addition, as with original BLAs, biosimilar product applications will not be approved unless the product is manufactured in facilities designed to assure and preserve the biological product’s safety, purity and potency.
The submission of an application via the Section 351(k) pathway does not guarantee that the FDA will accept the application for filing and review, as the FDA may refuse to accept applications that it finds are incomplete. The FDA will treat a biosimilar application or supplement as incomplete if, among other reasons, any applicable user fees assessed under the Biosimilar User Fee Amendment of 2017 have not been paid. In addition, the FDA may accept an application for filing but deny approval on the basis that the sponsor has not demonstrated biosimilarity, in which case the sponsor may choose to conduct further analytical, preclinical or clinical studies to demonstrate such biosimilarity under Section 351(k) or submit an original BLA for licensure as a new biological product under Section 351(a) of the PHSA.

16



The timing of final FDA approval of a biosimilar for commercial distribution depends on a variety of factors, including whether the manufacturer of the branded product is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which time the FDA is prohibited from approving any products that are biosimilar to the branded product. The FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application for 12 years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. Additionally, a biosimilar product sponsor may not submit an application under the Section 351(k) pathway for four years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent and thus block the Section 351(k) BLA from being approved on or after the patent expiration date. In addition, the FDA may under certain circumstances extend the exclusivity period for the reference product by an additional six months if the FDA requests, and the manufacturer undertakes, studies on the effect of its product in children, a so-called pediatric extension.
The first biological product determined to be interchangeable with a branded product for any condition of use is also entitled to a period of exclusivity, during which time the FDA may not determine that another product is interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use. This exclusivity period extends until the earlier of: (1) one year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable product; (2) 18 months after resolution of a patent infringement suit instituted under 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(6) against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product, based on a final court decision regarding all of the patents in the litigation or dismissal of the litigation with or without prejudice; (3) 42 months after approval of the first interchangeable product, if a patent infringement suit instituted under 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(6) against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product is still ongoing; or (4) 18 months after approval of the first interchangeable product if the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product has not been sued under 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(6).

Certain products or product candidates, such as the OBI presentation of UDENYCA we are developing, may be composed of components, such as drug components and device components that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities, and frequently by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Specifically, under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be:

● | a product composed of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and composed of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, or device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any investigational drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the FFDCA and its implementing regulations, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. The designation of a lead center generally eliminates the need to receive approvals from more than one FDA component for combination products, although it does not preclude consultations by the lead center with other components of the FDA. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a drug-device combination product is attributable to the drug product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the drug product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.

17



A combination product with a biologic primary mode of action generally would be reviewed and approved pursuant to the biologic licensure processes under the PHSA. In reviewing the BLA or Section 351(k) BLA for such a product, however, FDA reviewers in the drug center could consult with their counterparts in the device center to ensure that the device component of the combination product met applicable requirements regarding safety, purity, potency, durability and performance. In addition, under FDA regulations, combination products are subject to cGMP requirements applicable to both drugs and devices, including the Quality System regulations applicable to medical devices.
Advertising and Promotion
Once an NDA, original BLA, or Section 351(k) BLA is approved, a product will be subject to continuing post-approval regulatory requirements, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in significant penalties, including the issuance of warning letters directing a company to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA and federal and state civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions.
Biologics and drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. After approval, most changes to the approved product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new marketing application or supplement to the approved marketing application before the change can be implemented. A supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing supplements as it does in reviewing original application. There are also continuing annual program user fee requirements for marketed products.
Adverse Event Reporting and GMP Compliance
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of a marketing application. The FDA also may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 testing, a REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals, request product recalls or impose marketing restrictions through labeling changes or product removals if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or with manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18




● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
We are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and transparency laws and regulations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statutes or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers.
Additionally, federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the United States government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance with such beneficiary inducement provision of the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law can result in civil money penalties for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs.
Federal and state government price reporting laws require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs. Such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on marketed products. Participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements subject manufacturers to potentially significant discounts on products, increased infrastructure costs, and potentially limit the ability to offer certain marketplace discounts.
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”), among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors, certain non-physician practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse midwives) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in significant civil monetary penalties for any payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission, and additional penalties for “knowing failures.” Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.

19



The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payers, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Some states also require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers and institutions as well as marketing expenditures and pricing information.
The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. A violation of any of such laws or any other applicable governmental regulations may result in penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, additional reporting obligations and oversight if the government requires a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and/or imprisonment.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States and other countries, sales of UDENYCA and any other products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payers are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. In addition, the United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit our net revenue and results. A significant portion of our sales are subject to substantial discounts to list price, including rebates we may be required to pay to Medicaid agencies or discounts we may be required to pay to 340B covered entities. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for UDENYCA or other products for which we receive regulatory approval or a decision by a third-party payer to not cover our products could reduce physician utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 Government Price Reporting 
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government covering individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (“MDRP”), as a condition of having federal funds available for our covered outpatient drugs under Medicaid and under Medicare Part B, we must enter into, and have entered into, an agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services to pay a rebate to state Medicaid programs for each unit of our covered outpatient drugs dispensed to a Medicaid beneficiary and paid for by the state Medicaid program. Medicaid rebates are based on pricing data that we are required to report on a monthly and quarterly basis to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the federal agency that administers the MDRP and Medicare programs. For the MDRP, these data include the average manufacturer price (“AMP”) for each drug and, in the case of innovator products, the Best Price, which represents the lowest price available from us to any wholesaler, retailer, provider, health maintenance organization, nonprofit entity, or governmental entity in the United States in any pricing structure, calculated to include all applicable sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions. In connection with Medicare Part B, we must provide CMS with Average Sales Price (“ASP”) information on a quarterly basis. CMS uses this information to compute Medicare Part B payment rates, which consist of ASP plus a specified percentage. If we become aware that our MDRP submissions for a prior period were incorrect or have changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we must resubmit the corrected data for up to three years after those data originally were due. If we fail to provide information timely or are found to have knowingly submitted false information to CMS, we may be subject to civil monetary penalties and other sanctions, including termination from the MDRP.

20



Federal law requires that a manufacturer that participates in the MDRP also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”) and requires us to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for our covered outpatient drugs when used in an outpatient setting. 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the AMP and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the MDRP. In general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price requirement. We must report 340B ceiling prices to HRSA on a quarterly basis, and HRSA publishes them to 340B covered entities. HRSA has finalized regulations regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities for 340B eligible drugs. HRSA has also finalized an administrative dispute resolution process through which 340B covered entities may pursue claims against participating manufacturers for overcharges. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program, such as adding further covered entities or requiring participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs when used in an inpatient setting.
In order to be eligible to have drug products paid for with federal funds under Medicaid and Medicare Part B and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, a manufacturer must also participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) pricing program. Under the VA FSS program, we must report the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (“Non-FAMP”) for our covered drugs to the VA and charge certain federal agencies no more than the Federal Ceiling Price, which is calculated based on Non-FAMP using a statutory formula. These four agencies are the VA, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service). We must also pay rebates on products purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program. If a manufacturer participating in the FSS program fails to provide timely information or is found to have knowingly submitted false information, the manufacturer may be subject to civil monetary penalties.
Individual states continue to consider and have enacted legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs and combination products. A number of states have either implemented or are considering implementation of drug price transparency legislation. Requirements under such laws include advance notice of planned price increases, reporting price increase amounts and factors considered in taking such increases, wholesale acquisition cost information disclosure to prescribers, purchasers, and state agencies, and new product notice and reporting. Such legislation could limit the price or payment for certain drugs, and a number of states are authorized to impose civil monetary penalties or pursue other enforcement mechanisms against manufacturers for the untimely, inaccurate, or incomplete reporting of drug pricing information or for otherwise failing to comply with drug price transparency requirements.
Healthcare Reform
The United States federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry, including legislation that seeks to indirectly or directly regulate pharmaceutical drug pricing. For more information, see “Risk Factors – Healthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.”
Environment
We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that require compliance with federal, state, and local regulations for the protection of the environment. The regulatory landscape continues to evolve, and we anticipate additional regulations in the near future. Laws and regulations are implemented and under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change mainly caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Our business is not energy intensive. Therefore, we do not anticipate being subject to a cap and trade system or other mitigation measure that would materially impact our capital expenditures, operations or competitive position. The building where our headquarters is located in Redwood City, California, has been awarded LEED Gold Certification from the United States Green Building Council. 
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2021, we had 332 employees. All were located in the United States and none of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and believe we have good relations with our employees and 

21



contractors. Our guiding principles are anchored on the goals of being able to recruit, incentivize, retain and integrate talented employees who can develop, implement, and drive long-term value creation strategies. 
​
Compensation and Benefits 
​
We believe our base wages and salaries are fair and competitive with the external labor markets in which our employees work and are reviewed on a regular basis. We offer incentive programs that provide cash bonus opportunities to encourage and reward participants for our achievement of financial and other key performance metrics and strengthen the connection between pay and performance. We also grant equity compensation awards that vest over time through our long-term incentive plan to eligible employees to align such employees’ incentives with our long-term strategic objectives and the interests of our stockholders.
​
We also offer competitive benefits to our employees, including paid vacation and holidays, family leave, disability insurance, life insurance, healthcare, dental and vision coverage, dependent care flexible spending accounts, a 401(k) plan with a company match, and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Additionally, we offer an Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”) that includes professional support for employees to balance the stress of personal and professional demands.
​
Inclusion and Diversity
​
People are a critical component of our efforts to drive growth and deliver value for stockholders. One of the ways we have put people at the center of our business is by continuing to work toward a more inclusive and diverse workplace where each person feels respected, valued and seen and can be the best version of themselves. We believe that having a truly diverse workplace helps our company to achieve the best results, including by striving for diversity in terms of gender, ethnicity, nationality, disability status, and veteran status. We launched our Diversity and Inclusion Program to our employees in 2020 and intend to continue implementation of the program in 2022. As of December 31, 2021, ethnically diverse employees represented approximately 37% of our employees and women comprised 51% of our employees. We donate to non-profit organizations such as Life Science Cares, an organization focused on eliminating the impact of poverty on our neighbors. Our Chief Executive Officer also serves on the Board of Advisors of Life Science Cares.
​
Health and Safety
​
We are committed to a safe workplace for our employees and have implemented health and safety management processes, including training and awareness, into our operations. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented additional safety measures for the protection of our employees, including work-from-home measures for applicable employees and additional cleaning and protective measures. We have provided complimentary COVID-19 testing and personal protective equipment (“PPE”) for our employees since June 2020 and continue to evaluate measures to keep our employees and other stakeholders safe as we work together. We are requiring all employees to be fully-vaccinated and to get their recommended booster shots as recommended by the United States Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.
​
Training, Development and Engagement
​
We have launched a training platform that provides a variety of training topics and offers management training to advance leadership skills. Through our online learning platform, we deliver a variety of required learning modules, including those modules tied to our Code of Business Conduct, sexual harassment and anticorruption policies, which are completed annually by all team members. In 2021, we began a formal employee engagement initiative seeking feedback from new team members during their first 90 days and will continue this program to ensure all team members have the resources they need to be successful and to give all employees the platform to share meaningful feedback to help improve our company.
