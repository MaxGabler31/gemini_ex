The Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada in September 1997 as All American Casting International, Inc. and changed its name to VOIP MDU.com in 2004 and subsequently to VoIP-Pal.Com Inc. in 2006. Since March 2004, the Company has been in the development stage of becoming a VoIP re-seller, a provider of a proprietary transactional billing platform tailored to the points and air mile business, and a provider of anti-virus applications for smartphones. In 2013, Voip-Pal acquired Digifonica International (DIL) Limited (“Digifonica”), to fund and co-develop Digifonica’s patent suite.
 
Voip-Pal is a technical leader in the broadband Voice-over-Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) market with the ownership and continuing development of a portfolio of leading-edge VoIP Patents. Voip-Pal’s primary products are VoIP-related patented technology. The Company has spent several years testing and developing this technology. The Company is currently seeking to monetize the patents through a corporate transaction, an asset sale, or licensure of its products.
 
Voip-Pal’s intellectual property value is derived from ten issued USPTO patents. Voip-Pal inventions described in these patents provide the means to integrate VoIP services with any of the legacy telecommunications systems to create a seamless service using either legacy telephone numbers or IP addresses, and enhance the performance and value of VoIP implementations worldwide.
 
Voice over IP (Internet Protocol), or VoIP, has been and continues to be a green field for innovation that has spawned numerous inventions, greatly benefitting consumers large and small across the globe. VoIP is used in many places and by every modern telephony system vendor, network supplier, and retail and wholesale carrier.
 
Digifonica was founded in 2003 with the vision that the internet would be the future of all forms of telecommunications. Digifonica assembled a team of twenty top engineers with expertise in Linux and Internet telephony, who set out to develop solutions for future connectivity using the internet. The team developed and wrote a software suite that would later be patented by the USPTO with applications that provided solutions for five core areas of internet connectivity:
 

● | Routing, Billing and Rating 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Lawful Intercept 
● | Short Number Dialing (Enhanced 911) 
● | Mobile Gateway 
● | Uninterrupted Mobile Prototype 

 
In order to properly test the applications, Digifonica built and operated three production nodes in Vancouver, Canada (Peer 1), London, UK (Teliasonera), and Denmark. The Company has a pilot system available for test and demonstration as part of its current technology activities.
 
Upon successfully developing the technology, Digifonica filed for patents with the USPTO. All of Digifonica’s patents have been allowed. Thorough prior art searches have found there to be no existing prior art. On August 27, 2015, the USPTO allowed the last of Digifonica’s ten major patents. Voip-Pal considers patent US 8,542,815 “Producing routing messages for voice over IP communications” and its continuation patent, US 2013-0329722 (Application 13/966096, Notice of Allowance 8/27/2015), to be fundamental.

Due to the fundamentality of Digifonica’s Routing, Billing and Rating patent and its messaging continuation patent, usage of the technology may be widespread throughout a variety of telecommunications applications. Accordingly, Voip-Pal and Digifonica consider themselves to have a stake among the vast subscribership which utilizes its routing and call classification technology for all applicable voice, messaging and internet payments employing messaging routing classifications. The Company is currently seeking to monetize the patents through a sale or licensure.

Principal Products or Services
 
Voip-Pal’s intellectual property value is derived from ten issued USPTO patents; including five parent patents, one of which is foundational and the others build upon the former. Voip-Pal inventions described in these patents provide the means to integrate VoIP services with any of the Telco systems to create a seamless service using either Legacy telephone numbers or IP addresses, and enhance the performance and value of VoIP implementations worldwide. Voip-Pal patented technology provides: Universal numbering ubiquity; Network value as defined by Metcalfe; the imperative of interconnect, termination, and recompense for delivery of calls by other networks; Regulatory compliance in regulated markets; Interconnection of VoIP networks to mobile and fixed networks; and Maintenance of uninterrupted VoIP calls across fixed, mobile, and Wi-Fi networks.
 
Voice over IP (Internet Protocol), or VoIP, has been and continues to be a greenfield for innovation that has spawned numerous inventions, greatly benefitting consumers large and small across the globe. Brands such as Vonage, Skype, and Magic Jack are well-known retail VoIP implementations. However, VoIP is used in many other places that we may not realize and by practically every modern telephony system vendor, network supplier, and retail and wholesale carrier.
 
Whether a call is placed directly through a VoIP service retailer or a long-distance call is made over a traditional phone system or mobile carrier, it is likely that VoIP is employed somewhere in the stream. In everyday communications VoIP is rapidly expanding towards ubiquity. Wherever a metered VoIP call is routed, it is likely already benefitting from a Voip-Pal invention.
 
About Voip-Pal’s Patents
 
Lawful Intercept (LI): (“Intercepting VoIP communications and other data communications”) US Patent Application, Publication No. 20100150138, (Link to Lawful Intercept USPTO filing): This patent was issued on April 16, 2013 as US Patent No. 8,422,507. Lawful Intercept Continuation patent application was filed with the USPTO. This Continuation leverages patented technology for instant and text messages, and inherits the same Priority date of November 29, 2007. A Response in Europe has also been filed. Lawful Intercept is a revolutionary technology that addresses the national and international demands by governments to enable law agencies the ability to perform scheduled and live intercepts on VoIP telephone conversations. Network Service providers such as Skype may soon want to be in compliance with government regulations regarding Lawful Intercept. The advantage of this patent is that it is truly undetectable by the intercept target; as opposed to many prior art technologies. Various governments are considering legislating Lawful Intercept as a mandatory technology for any VoIP provider.
 
Routing, Billing and Rating engine (RBR): (“Producing routing messages for VoIP communications”) US Patent Application, Publication No. 20100150328, (Link to RBR USPTO filing): This patent was issued on September 24, 2013, as US Patent No. 8,542,815. A Response to Europe has also been filed. The Company believes that this patent application technology will be the foundation of any modern commercial VoIP system.

Amount Spent on Research and Development
 
For the two years ended September 30, 2017, the Company has incurred no research and development expenses.
 
Employees
 
We have one full time employee. The Company utilizes various consultants and contractors for other services.
 
Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We are an “emerging growth company” as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”) and, as such, have elected to comply with certain reduced public company reporting requirements for future filings.
 
In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other things:
 

● | Exemptions for “emerging growth companies” from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a new form of financing to small companies; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; 
● | Relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings; 
● | Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and 
● | Exemption from registration by a non-reporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration, documentation or offering requirements. 

 
In general, under the JOBS Act a company is an “emerging growth company” if its initial public offering (“IPO”) of common equity securities was effected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. We will retain “emerging growth company” status until the earliest of:
 

(i) | the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more, 
------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company’s IPO; 
(iii) | the company’s issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or 
(iv) | the company becoming a “larger accelerated filer” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

 
The JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact the Company are discussed below.

Financial Disclosure. The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an “emerging growth company” pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows:
 

(i) | audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years (provided that “smaller reporting companies” such as the Company are only required to provide two years of financial statements); 
------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited (provided that “smaller reporting companies” such as the Company are not required to provide selected financial data as required by Item 301 of Regulation S-K); and 
(iii) | executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for “smaller reporting companies.” 

 
However, the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs to include audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years with no required tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.
 
The JOBS Act also exempts the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm from having to comply with any rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) after the date of the JOBS Act’s enactment, except as otherwise required by SEC rule.
 
The JOBS Act further exempts an “emerging growth company” from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the Company’s accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit.
 
Internal Control Attestation. The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm to file a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, although management of the Company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Section 102(a) of the JOBS Act exempts “emerging growth companies” from the requirements in §14A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for companies with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.
 
Other Items of the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The JOBS Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an “emerging growth company” regardless of whether such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision. In addition, the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of research reports on the “emerging growth company’s” IPOs.
 
Section 106 of the JOBS Act permits “emerging growth companies” to submit registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments thereto are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is intended to allow “emerging growth companies” to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow.
 
Election to Opt Out of Transition Period. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts “emerging growth companies” from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act of 1933, as amended, registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard.
 
The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of the transition period. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with any other public company which is not either an “emerging growth company” nor an “emerging growth company” which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used.
 
For so long as we remain an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” as described above. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on some or all of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. If we avail ourselves of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements, as is currently our plan, our reduced disclosure may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us and may result in less investor confidence.
