Forward-Looking Statements
 
This Annual Report contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward looking statements may be identified by reference to a future period or periods, or by use of forward looking terminology, such as “may,” “will,” “believe,” “expect,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “continue,” or similar terms or variations on those terms, or the negative of those terms. Forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks, assumptions, and uncertainties, including, among other things, the following important factors that could affect the actual outcome of future events: general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market or service areas, that are worse than expected; significantly increased competition among depository and other financial institutions; inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins or fair value of financial instruments; changes in laws or government regulations affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees and capital requirements; our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities; changes in consumer spending, borrowing, and savings habits; changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, taxing authorities and the Financial Accounting Standards Board; and changes in our organization, compensation, and benefit plans.
 
Oritani Financial Corp. (“the Company”) wishes to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.

Loans:
 
Residential Loans. We originate one to four family residential mortgage loans, substantially all of which are secured by properties located in our primary market area.  At June 30, 2019, $267.0 million, or 7.6% of our loan portfolio, consisted of one to four family residential mortgage loans and home equity loans.  We generally retain for our portfolio substantially all of the loans that we originate.  Residential mortgage loan originations are generally obtained from existing or past customers, through advertising, and through referrals from local builders, real estate brokers, and attorneys, and are underwritten pursuant to Oritani Bank’s policies and standards.  The Company maintains a program where a fee is paid to a broker for a loan referral that results in an origination or a purchase of a recently closed loan.  Generally, residential mortgage loans are originated in amounts up to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the property, with private mortgage insurance required on loans with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 80%.  We generally will not make loans with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 90%.  Fixed rate mortgage loans are originated for terms of up to 30 years.  Generally, fixed rate residential mortgage loans are underwritten according to Freddie Mac guidelines, policies and procedures, with a maximum origination amount of $2.0 million.  Oritani Bank's residential underwriting satisfies the "qualified mortgages" regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  Oritani Bank does not originate non-qualified mortgage loans.  We do not originate or purchase, and our loan portfolio does not include, any sub-prime loans.
 
We also offer adjustable rate mortgage loans for one to four family properties, with an interest rate based on the weekly average yield on U.S. Treasuries adjusted to a constant maturity of one-year, which adjust either annually or every three years from the outset of the loan or which adjust annually after a five-, seven- or ten-year initial fixed rate period.  Originations of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans totaled $8.8 million and $10.2 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Our adjustable rate residential mortgage loans generally provide for maximum rate adjustments of 2% per adjustment, with a lifetime maximum adjustment up to 6%, regardless of the initial rate.  Our adjustable rate residential mortgage loans amortize over terms of up to 30 years.
 
Adjustable rate mortgage loans decrease the Bank’s risk associated with changes in market interest rates by periodically repricing, but involve other risks because, as interest rates increase, the underlying payments by the borrower increase, thus increasing the potential for default by the borrower.  At the same time, the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates.  Upward adjustment of the contractual interest rate is also limited by the maximum periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustments permitted by our loan documents and, therefore, the effectiveness of adjustable rate mortgage loans may be limited during periods of rapidly rising interest rates.  At June 30, 2019, $39.7 million, or 14.9%, of our residential mortgage loans had adjustable rates of interest.
 
In an effort to provide financing for first-time home buyers, we offer our own first-time home buyer loan program.  This program offers one to four family residential mortgage loans to qualified individuals.  These loans are underwritten and offered with terms and adjustable and fixed rates of interest similar to our other one to four family mortgage loan products.  With this program, borrowers receive a discounted mortgage interest rate and do not pay certain loan origination fees.  Such loans must be secured by an owner-occupied residence.  These loans are originated using similar underwriting guidelines as our other one to four family mortgage loans.  Such loans are originated in amounts of up to 90% of the lower of the property’s appraised value or the sale price.  Private mortgage insurance is not required for such loans.  The maximum amount of such loan is $275,000.  We also participate in the Federal Home Loan Bank’s (“FHLB”) Mortgage Partnership Finance (“MPF”) program.  The MPF program offers potentially lower rates to qualified individuals on one to four family residential mortgage loans and provides the Bank with additional opportunity for income.  Loans originated through the MPF program can be sold to FHLB with minimal recourse to the Bank.
 
We also offer our directors, officers and employees who satisfy certain criteria and our general underwriting standards fixed or adjustable rate loan products with reduced interest rates, excluding loans originated through the MPF program.  These loans adhere to all other terms and conditions contained in the loan policy.
 
All residential mortgage loans that we originate include “due-on-sale” clauses, which give us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event that, among other things, the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid.  Regulations limit the amount that a savings bank may lend relative to the appraised value of the real estate securing the loan, as determined by an appraisal of the property at the time the loan is originated.  All borrowers are required to obtain title insurance for the benefit of Oritani Bank.  We also require homeowner’s insurance and fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance on properties securing real estate loans.
 
We also offer second mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit, which are included in the residential mortgage loan portfolio.  These mortgage loans are secured by one to four family residences, substantially all of which are located in our primary market area.  At June 30, 2019, second mortgage and equity loans totaled $7.8 million, or 0.22% of total loans.  Additionally, at June 30, 2019, the unadvanced amounts of home equity lines of credit totaled $6.6 million.  The underwriting standards utilized for second mortgage loans and equity lines of credit include a determination of the applicant’s credit history, an assessment of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan.  The combined (first and second mortgage liens) loan-to-value ratio for second mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit is generally limited to 70%.  Second mortgage loans are offered with fixed and adjustable rates of interest and with terms of up to 30 years.  Our home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest which are indexed to the prime rate, as reported in The Wall Street Journal.
 
Second mortgage loans and equity loans entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly if they are secured by an asset that has a superior security interest.  In addition, equity loan collections depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.

Commercial Real Estate ("CRE") Loans. We originate residential and non-residential commercial real estate mortgage loans.  At June 30, 2019, $3.25 billion, or 92.2% of our loan portfolio, consisted of commercial real estate loans.  Our residential CRE mortgage loans, $2.09 billion or  59.0% of our loan portfolio, are primarily permanent loans secured by apartment buildings and mobile home parks.  The non-residential CRE mortgage portfolio consists of grocery/credit retail CRE and other CRE.  Our grocery/credit retail CRE mortgage loans, $482.8 million or 13.7% of our loan portfolio, are primarily permanent mortgage loans secured by grocery or credit anchor tenants at multi-store, or stand alone, facilities.  Our other CRE mortgage loans, $683.7 million or 19.4% of our loan portfolio, are primarily permanent loans secured by improved property such as retail multi-stores without a credit anchor, mixed-use properties, self-storage facilities, commercial warehouses, and office buildings.  The typical CRE mortgage loan has a fixed rate of interest for the first three or five years, after which the loan reprices to a market index plus a spread, with a floor of the original rate. The fixed rate period is occasionally extended to as much as ten years.  These loans typically amortize over 30 years though we will often require shorter amortization. We also offer such loans on a self-amortizing basis with fixed rate terms up to 20 years.  References to commercial real estate loans below refer to residential and non-residential commercial real estate.

Index


The terms and conditions of each CRE loan are tailored to the needs of the borrower and based on the financial strength of the project and any guarantors.  In reaching a decision on whether to make a commercial real estate loan, we consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise and credit history, risks inherent in the property’s tenants, the global cash flows of the borrower, the value of the underlying property and other factors.  Loan to value ratios are a very important consideration.  Depending on the collateral type, our lending policies allow commercial real estate loan originations in an amount up to 80% of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property, whichever is less.  However, our maximum loan to value ratio is generally 75% on purchase  transactions and 70% on refinance transactions.  Other factors we consider, with respect to commercial real estate rental properties, include the term of the lease(s) and the quality of the tenant(s).  We generally require that the properties securing these real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of earnings before debt service to debt service) of at least 1.25 times.  Environmental reports are generally required for commercial real estate loans.  Commercial real estate loans made to corporations, partnerships and other business entities may require personal guarantees by the principals as warranted.  Property inspections are conducted, for most CRE loans, no less than every three years, or more frequently as warranted.
 
For commercial real estate loans with balances greater than $2.5 million, a borrower’s financial information is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring annual financial statement updates and payment history reviews.  We require commercial borrowers to provide annually updated financial statements and federal tax returns.  These requirements also apply to the individual principals of our commercial borrowers.  We also require borrowers with rental investment property to provide an annual report of income and expenses for the property, including a tenant list and copies of leases, as applicable.  The largest residential CRE loan in our portfolio at June 30, 2019 was a $31.9 million loan secured by multi-family and mixed-use buildings located in Brooklyn, New York.  The largest credit retail CRE loan at June 30, 2019 was a $29.3 million loan secured by several freestanding pharmacy stores, located in Virginia, Pennsylvania and Connecticut.  The largest other CRE loan in our portfolio at June 30, 2019 was a $29.3 million loan secured by a multi-tenant retail power center located in Rio Grande, New Jersey.  All of these loans are performing in accordance with their terms.  Our largest commercial real estate relationship consisted of 40 properties primarily secured by multi-family buildings located mainly in our primary market area. The aggregate outstanding loan balance for this relationship, comprised of several legal entities, is $59.7 million at June 30, 2019, and these loans are all performing in accordance with their terms.
 
Loans secured by commercial real estate (residential and non-residential) generally involve larger principal amounts and a greater degree of risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans.  Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate are often dependent on successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy.  See “Item 1A, Risk Factors – Our Continued Emphasis On Commercial Real Estate Lending Could Expose Us To Increased Lending Risks.”
 
       We originate construction loans for the development of residential and commercial properties located in our primary market area on a limited basis.  Residential construction loans are generally offered to experienced local developers operating in our primary market area and to individuals for the construction of their personal residences.  At June 30, 2019, construction and land loans totaled $9.2 million, or 0.3 % of total loans.

Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Participations and Servicing of Loans. Lending activities are conducted primarily by our loan personnel operating at our corporate office as well as commercial real estate origination offices in Cherry Hill, New Jersey and New York City.  All loans originated by us are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures.  We originate both adjustable rate and fixed rate loans.  Our ability to originate fixed or adjustable rate loans is dependent upon the relative customer demand for such loans, which is affected by the current and expected future levels of market interest rates.
 
During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, loan originations totaled $414.4 million and $470.7 million, respectively, all of which were retained by us.  Loan purchases totaled $138.5 million and $69.2 million for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.  There were no loans originated and sold under the FHLB MPF program during fiscal 2019 or 2018.
 
We will also participate in loans, sometimes as the “lead lender.”  When we are not the lead lender, the underwriting of the loan participations closely match our own underwriting criteria and procedures.  At June 30, 2019, we had $243.8 million in loan participation interests.
 
At June 30, 2019, in addition to participation interests we were servicing loans sold in the amount of $2.3 million.  Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent mortgagors, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of unremedied defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans.
 
Non-Performing and Problem Assets
 
We commence collection efforts when a loan becomes ten days past due with system generated reminder notices.  Subsequent late charges and delinquent notices are issued and the account is monitored on a regular basis thereafter.  Collections meetings with executive management are regularly held and every delinquent loan is discussed.  When a loan is more than 30 days past due, the credit file is reviewed and, if deemed necessary, information is updated or confirmed and collateral re-evaluated.  Personal, direct contact with the borrower is attempted early in the collection process.  We make every effort to contact the borrower and develop a plan of repayment to cure the delinquency.  A summary report of all loans 30 days or more past due is reported to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis.  If no repayment plan is in process and the loan is delinquent at least two payments, the file is referred to counsel for the commencement of foreclosure or other collection efforts.
 
Loans are placed on non-accrual status when they are more than 90 days delinquent.  When loans are placed on a non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed.  Once the outstanding principal balance is brought current, income is recognized to the extent the loan is deemed fully collectible.  If the deficiencies causing the delinquency are resolved, such loans may be returned to accrual status once all arrearages are resolved and a period of satisfactory payment performance, usually six months.  See additional discussion regarding our non-performing assets at June 30, 2019 in “Management Discussion and Analysis.”

In addition to the delinquent loans listed above, we occasionally have had loans that were delinquent 90 days or more past due as to principal.  Typically, such loans had passed their maturity date but continued making monthly payments, keeping their interest current, while negotiating external financing or an extension from the Company.  There were no loans delinquent 90 days or more past their maturity date at June 30, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 or 2015.
 
Real Estate Owned. Real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until sold.  When property is acquired it is recorded at the lower of cost or fair market value at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis.  Holding costs and declines in fair value result in charges to expense after acquisition.  The Company had real estate owned of $557,000 at June 30, 2019 and $140,000 at June 30, 2018.  The Company sold one property with book value of $1.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2019.  Proceeds from the sale of real estate owned were $1.9 million, resulting in $855,000 gain.
Classified Assets. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) regulations provide that loans and other assets of lesser quality should be classified as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” assets.  An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that we will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.”  Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.

We are to establish general reserves, where appropriate, for our non-impaired loan portfolio, including non-impaired loans classified as doubtful, substandard or special mention.  General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent incurred losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets.  When we classify problem assets as “loss,” we are required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount.  The Company utilizes the services of a third party loan review firm to help ensure that loans are properly classified.  They report to the Audit Committee quarterly and their scope is determined by the Audit Committee annually.  On an annual basis, the loan review firm reviews a significant portion of the existing portfolio over the course of the year, typically an aggregate of approximately 65% of the commercial real estate portfolios, including a sampling of both new and seasoned loans, a review of all "Regulation O" loans, construction loans with balances of $250,000 or more, and review of all criticized or classified CRE loans with balances of $250,000 or more.  Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the FDIC and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (“NJDOBI”) which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.  Such examinations typically occur annually.
 
The following table shows the aggregate amounts of our classified assets, including non-performing loans, at the date indicated.

              There were no loans  classified as doubtful or loss on June 30, 2019, 2018 or 2017. The loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations.  Not all classified assets constitute non-performing assets.
 
 We also utilize an additional classification for assets that do not meet the definition of any of the classified assets yet contain an element that warrants a rating that is less than “pass.”  We classify an asset as “special mention” if the asset has a potential weakness that warrants management’s close attention.  While such assets are not impaired, management has concluded that if the potential weakness in the asset is not addressed, the value of the asset may deteriorate, adversely affecting the repayment of the asset.  Our assets classified as “special mention” totaled $6.1 million, $14.9 million and $22.0 million at June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.   See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


Impaired Loans. The Company defines an impaired loan as a loan for which it is probable, based on current information, that the Company will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  Loans we individually classify as impaired include residential CRE, grocery/credit retail CRE, Other CRE and construction loans with balances of $1.0 million or more, unless a condition exists for loans less than $1.0 million regardless of portfolio segment, that would increase the Bank’s potential loss exposure.  Troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") are also included in impaired loans regardless of balance.  Impaired loans are individually assessed to determine that each loan’s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the related collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows.  If the loan’s carrying value does exceed the fair value, specific reserves are established to reduce the loan’s carrying value.  For classification purposes, impaired loans are typically classified as substandard.  Impaired loans at June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $9.3 million,  $9.2 million and $13.9 million, respectively.   See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Allowance for Loan Losses
 
Our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level necessary to absorb incurred loan losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable.  Management, in determining the allowance for loan losses, considers the incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activities, along with the general economic and real estate market conditions.  Loan losses are charged to the allowance for loans losses and recoveries are credited to it.  Additions to the allowance for loan losses are provided by charges against income based on various factors which, in our judgment, deserve current recognition in estimating probable incurred losses.  We regularly review the loan portfolio and make adjustments for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  The allowance for loan losses consists primarily of the following two components:
 
(1) Specific allowances established for impaired loans.  The amount of impairment provided for as an allowance is represented by the deficiency, if any, between the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original loan’s effective interest rate or the underlying collateral value (less estimated costs to sell) if the loan is collateral dependent, and the carrying value of the loan.  No reserve is necessary if the impaired value exceeds the book value.  Impaired loans are included within the Substandard classification.

Index



(2) General allowances established for incurred loan losses on a portfolio basis for loans that do not meet the definition of impaired.  The portfolio is grouped into similar risk characteristics, primarily loan type, collateral type, and internal credit risk rating.  We apply an estimated loss rate to each loan group.  The loss rates applied are based on a eight years year look back period, which measures our historical charge-offs, and our loss emergence period, which represents the estimated average time between when a loss event occurs and when such loss is specifically reserved or charged off.  This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revisions based upon changes in economic and real estate market conditions.  Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance for loan losses we have established, which could have a material negative effect on our financial results.
 
The adjustments to our loss experience are based on our evaluation of several environmental factors, including:
 
  
• | actual loss history incurred on similar loans;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | changes in local, regional, national, and international economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectibility of our portfolio, including the condition of various market segments; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in the nature and volume of our portfolio and in the terms of our loans;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of nonaccrual loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in the quality of our loan review system; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We evaluate the allowance for loan losses based on the combined total of the specific and general components.  Generally when the loan portfolio increases, absent other factors, our allowance for loan loss methodology results in a higher dollar amount of estimated probable incurred losses than would be the case without the increase.  Generally when the loan portfolio decreases, absent other factors, our allowance for loan loss methodology results in a lower dollar amount of estimated probable incurred losses than would be the case without the decrease.
 
Each quarter we evaluate the allowance for loan losses and adjust the allowance as appropriate through a provision or recovery for loan losses.  While we use the best information available to make evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the information used in making the evaluations.  In addition, as an integral part of their examination process, the NJDOBI and the FDIC will periodically review the allowance for loan losses.  They may require us to adjust the allowance based on their analysis of information available to them at the time of their examination.  Such examinations typically occur annually.

The allowance for loan losses has been relatively stable.  The Company recorded a reversal of provision for loan losses of $2.0 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019.  There was no provision for loan losses during 2018 and 2017.  Improving delinquency and nonaccrual trends, changes in loan risk ratings (versus prior periods), loan growth, charge-offs and economic and business conditions continue to have a meaningful impact on the current level of provision for loan losses.  In addition, improvements in general economic and business conditions have also impacted the level of provisioning by decreasing the necessary level of general allowances despite growth in the loan portfolio.
Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses. The following table sets forth the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan category, the total loan balances by category (including loans held for sale), and the percent of loans in each category to total loans at the dates indicated.  The allowance for loan losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories.

Investments
 
The Board of Directors is responsible for adopting our investment policy.  The investment policy is reviewed periodically by management and any changes to the policy are recommended to and subject to the approval of the Board of Directors.  Authority to make investments under the approved investment policy guidelines is delegated to appropriate officers.  While general investment strategies are developed and authorized by the Board of Directors, the execution of specific actions primarily rests with Oritani Bank’s President, Chief Financial Officer and Asset/Liability Committee, which have responsibility for ensuring that the guidelines and requirements included in the investment policy are followed and that all securities are considered prudent for investment.  Each of our President, Chief Financial Officer and Asset/Liability Committee have specified authority to purchase various types of investments; all investment purchases in excess of 1% of total assets, or $40.7 million at June 30, 2019, must be approved by our Board of Directors.  All investment transactions are reviewed and ratified or approved (as the case may be) at regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors.  Any investment which, subsequent to its purchase, fails to meet the guidelines of the policy is reported to the Board of Directors at its next meeting where the Board decides whether to hold or sell the investment.
 
New Jersey-chartered savings banks have authority to invest in various types of assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, mortgage-backed securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured financial institutions, overnight and short-term loans to other banks and corporate debt instruments.  Oritani Financial Corp., as a Delaware corporation, may invest in equity securities subject to certain limitations.
 
The investment policy requires that all securities transactions be conducted in a safe and sound manner.  Investment decisions must be based upon a thorough analysis of each security instrument to determine if its quality and inherent risks fit within Oritani Bank’s overall asset/liability management objectives, the effect on its risk-based capital measurement and the prospects for yield and/or appreciation.  The investment policy provides that Oritani Bank may invest in U.S Treasury notes, U.S. and state agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, and other conservative investment opportunities.  Typical investments are currently in U.S. agency or FHLB securities and government sponsored mortgage-backed securities.
 
We also invest in mortgage-backed securities, all of which are guaranteed by government sponsored enterprises.  At June 30, 2019, our mortgage-backed securities portfolio totaled $344.9 million, or 8.5% of total assets, and consisted of $341.0 million in fixed-rate securities and $4.0 million in adjustable-rate securities, guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae.  Securities can be classified as held to maturity or available for sale at the date of purchase. We also recently started to invest in Corporate Notes. Our Corporate Notes total is $15.0 million and classified as held to maturity.
 
U.S. Government and Federal Agency Obligations. At June 30, 2019, our U.S. Government and federal agency securities portfolio totaled $5.0 million, all of which was classified as held to maturity.
 
Equity Securities. The Company's portfolio of equity securities had an estimated fair value of  $1.4 million and $1.6 million at June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Equity Securities are reported at estimated fair value on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company adopted FASB Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2016-01 on July 1, 2018. The ASU supersedes the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair value into different categories and requires equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income rather than accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Upon adoption, the Company recorded an after tax cumulative-effect adjustment of $658,000 in the consolidated statement of stockholders' equity, reclassified its equity securities out of available for sale securities to equity securities on the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented, and recognized unrealized changes in fair value through earnings. For periods prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-01, unrealized changes in fair value of equity securities were included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Unrealized changes in fair value of equity securities recognized through income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 is a net loss of $208,000. There were  no sales of equity securities for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
 
Mortgage-Backed Securities. We purchase mortgage-backed securities insured or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae.  We invest in mortgage-backed securities to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense, and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae.  Our investment policy also authorizes the investment in collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”), also insured or issued by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae.  We limit CMO investments to those classes of CMOs carrying the most stable cash flows and lowest prepayment risk of any class of CMOs and which pass the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s average life restriction tests at the time of purchase.  These CMO classes are typically referred to as Planned Amortization Classes or sequentials.
 
Mortgage-backed securities are created by the pooling of mortgages and the issuance of a security with an interest rate which is less than the interest rate on the underlying mortgages.  Mortgage-backed securities typically represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or multifamily mortgages, although we focus our investments on mortgage-backed securities backed by one to four family mortgages.  The issuers of such securities (generally U.S. government agencies and government sponsored enterprises, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae) pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as us, and guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors.  Mortgage-backed securities generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees and credit enhancements.  However, mortgage-backed securities are usually more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize our specific liabilities and obligations.

Index


At June 30, 2019, our mortgage-backed securities totaled $344.9 million, or 8.5%, of total assets and 8.8% of interest earning assets.  At June 30, 2019, 1.1% of the mortgage-backed securities were backed by adjustable rate mortgage loans and 98.9% were backed by fixed rate mortgage loans.  The mortgage-backed securities portfolio had a weighted average yield of 2.73% at June 30, 2019.  The fair value of our mortgage-backed securities at June 30, 2019 was $346.7 million, which is $1.4 million less than the amortized cost of $345.2 million.  Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual prepayments may differ from estimated prepayments over the life of the security, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments thereby changing the net yield on such securities.  There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or if such securities are redeemed by the issuer.  In addition, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates.  All of the Company’s mortgage-backed securities are insured or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae.
Corporate Notes. We purchased corporate notes during the third quarter of 2018. These securities have been classified as held to maturity since their purchase. At June 30, 2019, corporate notes totaled $15.0 million, or 4.1% of our total securities portfolio.
Debt Securities Portfolios. The following table sets forth the composition of our investment securities portfolio at the dates indicated.

Sources of Funds
 
General. Deposits have traditionally been the primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities.  We  use borrowings, primarily FHLB advances,  to supplement cash flow needs, to lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk management purposes and to manage the cost of funds.   We also use interest rate swaps to lengthen the maturities of liabilities and manage cost of funds.  In addition, funds are derived from scheduled loan payments, mortgaged-backed securities scheduled payments and prepayments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on other earning assets.  While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition.
Deposits. Our deposits are generated primarily from residents and businesses within our primary market area including the local municipal deposit market.  We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including checking accounts (demand deposits and NOW), money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, retirement accounts and time deposits.  The Bank also accepts brokered deposits and has augmented its usage of these funds to supplement its funding sources and decrease its cost of funds.  Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate.
 
Interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and other account features are established on a periodic basis.  Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals.  Personalized customer service, attractive account features, long-standing relationships with customers, convenient locations, competitive rates of interest and an active marketing program are relied upon to attract and retain deposits.
 
The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates and competition.  The variety of deposit accounts offered allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and responding to changes in consumer demand while managing interest rate risk and minimizing interest expense.
 
At June 30, 2019, $1.25 billion, or 42.7% of our deposit accounts were time deposits, of which $849.8 million had maturities of one year or less. We had brokered deposits totaling $471.2 million and $450.4 million at June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The following table sets forth the distribution of total deposits by account type, at the dates indicated.

 SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 
General
 
Federal law allows a state savings bank, such as Oritani Bank, that qualifies as a “qualified thrift lender” (discussed below), to elect to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended (“HOLA”).  Such an election results in the savings bank’s holding company being regulated as savings and loan holding company rather than as a bank holding company.  At the time of its reorganization into a holding company structure, Oritani Bank elected to be treated as a savings association under the applicable provisions of the HOLA.  Accordingly, Oritani Financial Corp. is a savings and loan holding company and is required to file certain reports with, and is subject to examination by, and otherwise must comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board that are applicable to savings and loan holding companies.  Oritani Financial Corp. is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.
 
Oritani Bank is a New Jersey-chartered savings bank, and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Funds (“DIF”) of the FDIC.  Oritani Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Commissioner of the NJDOBI as the issuer of its charter, and by the FDIC as the deposit insurer and its primary federal regulator.  Oritani Bank must file reports with the NJDOBI and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, and it must obtain regulatory approval prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions and opening, closing, moving or acquiring branch offices.  The NJDOBI and the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to assess Oritani Bank’s compliance with various regulatory requirements.  This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and depositors.  The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes.
 
Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by the NJDOBI, the FDIC, the FRB or the U.S. Congress, could have a material adverse impact on Oritani Financial Corp., Oritani Bank and their operations.
 
Certain of the regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to Oritani Bank and Oritani Financial Corp. are described below.  This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Oritani Bank and Oritani Financial Corp. and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations.
 
New Jersey Banking Regulation
 
Activity Powers. Oritani Bank derives its lending, investment and other powers primarily from the applicable provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act and its related regulations.  Under these laws and regulations, savings banks, such as Oritani Bank, generally may invest in:

(1) | real estate mortgages;
----+-----------------------


(2) | consumer and commercial loans;
----+-------------------------------


(3) | specific types of debt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | certain types of corporate equity securities; and
----+--------------------------------------------------


(5) | certain other assets.
----+----------------------



A savings bank may also invest pursuant to a “leeway” power that permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New Jersey Banking Act.  “Leeway” investments must comply with a number of limitations on the individual and aggregate amounts of “leeway” investments.  Under this “leeway” authority, New Jersey savings banks may exercise those powers, rights, benefits or privileges authorized for national banks or out-of-state banks or for federal or out-of-state savings banks or savings associations, provided that before exercising any such power, right, benefit or privilege, prior approval by the NJDOBI by regulation or by specific authorization is required. A savings bank may also exercise trust powers upon approval of the NJDOBI. The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers are limited by federal law and the related regulations. See “Federal Banking Regulation-Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks” below.
 
Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitations. With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey-chartered savings bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower or to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15% of the bank’s capital funds. A savings bank may lend an additional 10% of its capital funds if the loan is secured by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey Banking Act. Oritani Bank currently complies with applicable loans-to-one-borrower limitations.
 
Dividends. Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a stock savings bank may declare and pay a dividend on its capital stock only to the extent that the payment of the dividend would not impair the capital stock of the savings bank. In addition, a stock savings bank may not pay a dividend unless the savings bank would, after the payment of the dividend, have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock, or alternatively, the payment of the dividend would not reduce the surplus. Federal law may also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by Oritani Bank. See “-Federal Banking Regulation-Prompt Corrective Action” below.

Minimum Capital Requirements. Regulations of the NJDOBI impose on New Jersey-chartered depository institutions, such as Oritani Bank, minimum capital requirements similar to those imposed by the FDIC on insured state banks. See “Federal Banking Regulation-Capital Requirements.”
Examination and Enforcement. The NJDOBI may examine Oritani Bank whenever it deems an examination advisable. The NJDOBI typically examines Oritani Bank at least every two years. The NJDOBI may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound banking practice, and may direct any director, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the NJDOBI has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the NJDOBI why such person should not be removed.
Federal Banking Regulation
 
Capital Requirements. FDIC regulations require banks to maintain minimum levels of capital.  Federal regulations require state banks to meet several minimum capital standards:  a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8%, and a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.  The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.
 As noted, the risk-based capital standards for state banks require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively.  In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset.  Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk.  Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings.  Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital.  Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries.  Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital.  Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt.  Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values.  Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.  In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual associations where necessary.
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.  The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.  The capital conservation buffer as of June 30, 2019 is 2.50% and is fully phased in.
         Legislation enacted in May 2018 requires the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, to establish a "Community Bank Leverage Ratio” (the ratio of a bank’s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. A “qualifying community bank” that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered “well capitalized” under Prompt Corrective Action statutes.  The federal banking agencies may consider a financial institution’s risk profile when evaluating whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the capital ratio requirement.  The federal banking agencies must set the minimum capital for the new Community Bank Leverage Ratio at not less than 8 percent and not more than 10 percent.  A financial institution can elect to be subject to this new definition.  The establishment of the community bank leverage ratio is subject to notice and comment rulemaking by the federal regulators. The regulators have issued a proposed rule with 9 percent as the Community Bank Leverage Ratio.

Index


 The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have also adopted regulations to require an assessment of an institution’s exposure to declines in the economic value of a bank’s capital due to changes in interest rates when assessing the bank’s capital adequacy. Under such a risk assessment, examiners evaluate a bank’s capital for interest rate risk on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors. Institutions with significant interest rate risk may be required to hold additional capital. According to the agencies, applicable considerations include:

• | the quality of the bank’s interest rate risk management process;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | the overall financial condition of the bank; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | the level of other risks at the bank for which capital is needed.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------



The following table shows the Company's and the Bank’s Core capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, and Total risk-based capital ratios at June 30, 2019:
 

 | At June 30, 2019 | 
-----------------------------------------------+------------------------+--

Prompt Corrective Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that the federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The FDIC’s regulations define the five capital categories as follows:
 
An institution is classified as “well capitalized” if:
   
• | its ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 6.5%; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 10%; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | its ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 8%; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 5%, and it is not subject to any order or directive by the FDIC to meet a specific capital level.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



An institution is classified as “adequately capitalized” if:
   
• | its ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 4.5%; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 8%; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | its ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 6%; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 4%.
--+------------------------------------------------------------



An institution is classified as “undercapitalized” if:
 
  
• | its ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is less than 4.5%; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | its total risk-based capital is less than 8%; or
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | its Tier 1 risk-based-capital is less than 6%; or
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | its leverage ratio is less than 4% .
--+-------------------------------------



An institution is classified as “significantly undercapitalized” if:
 
  
• | its ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is less than 3.0%; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | its total risk-based capital is less than 6%;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | its Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is less than 4%; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | its leverage ratio is less than 3%.
--+------------------------------------



An institution that has a tangible capital to total assets ratio equal to or less than 2% is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized.”
 

23
 
Index


The FDIC is required, with some exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state bank if that bank is “critically undercapitalized.” The FDIC may also appoint a conservator or receiver for a state bank on the basis of the institution’s financial condition or upon the occurrence of certain events, including:

• | insolvency, or when the assets of the bank are less than its liabilities to depositors and others;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | likelihood that the bank will be unable to meet the demands of its depositors or to pay its obligations in the normal course of business; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | insufficient capital, or the incurring or likely incurring of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment of capital without federal assistance. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks. Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities and investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the FDIC.
 
Before making a new investment or engaging in a new activity as principal that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured bank must seek approval from the FDIC to make such investment or engage in such activity. The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance funds. Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a “financial subsidiary” are subject to additional restrictions.
 
Federal law permits a state-chartered savings bank to engage, through financial subsidiaries, in any activity in which a national bank may engage through a financial subsidiary and on substantially the same terms and conditions. In general, the law permits a national bank that is well-capitalized and well-managed to conduct, through a financial subsidiary, any activity permitted for a financial holding company other than insurance underwriting, insurance investments, real estate investment or development or merchant banking. The total assets of all such financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of the bank’s total assets or $50 billion. The bank must have policies and procedures to assess the financial subsidiary’s risk and protect the bank from such risk and potential liability, must not consolidate the financial subsidiary’s assets with the bank’s and must exclude from its own assets and equity all equity investments, including retained earnings, in the financial subsidiary. State chartered savings banks may retain subsidiaries in existence as of March 11, 2000 and may engage in activities that are not authorized under federal law. Although Oritani Bank meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries, it has not yet determined to do so.

Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Oritani Bank is a member of the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts at Oritani Bank are insured by the FDIC, generally up to a maximum of $250,000.
 
The FDIC imposes an assessment for deposit insurance against all insured depository institutions.  This assessment is primarily based on a risk assessment of the institution, and certain risk adjustments specified by the FDIC, with riskier institutions paying higher assessments.  Effective April 1, 2011, the FDIC implemented a requirement of the Dodd-Frank Act that it revise its assessment system to base it on each institution’s total assets less tangible capital of each institution instead of deposits.  The FDIC also revised its assessment schedule so that it ranged from 2.5 basis points for the least risky institutions to 45 basis points for the riskiest.  In conjunction with the DIF achieving a 1.5% ratio, the FDIC reduced the assessment range for most banks to 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points, effective July 1, 2016.
 
The deposit insurance assessment rates are in addition to the assessments for payments on the bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing Corporation, or FICO, to recapitalize the now defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.  The FICO payments will continue until the final FICO bonds mature in 2019.  Our expense for the assessment of deposit insurance and the FICO payments was $1.1 million and $1.2 million for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
The FDIC has authority to increase deposit insurance assessments.  A material increase in insurance assessments would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of the Bank.

Federal Home Loan Bank System. Oritani Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. As a member of the FHLB of New York, Oritani Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB in an amount at least equal to 1% of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans and similar obligations at the beginning of each year, 4.5% of its borrowings from the FHLB, or 0.2% of mortgage-related assets, whichever is greater. As of June 30, 2019, Oritani Bank was in compliance with this requirement.
Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured savings banks, including Oritani Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders, to remove directors and officers and terminate deposit insurance. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and to unsafe or unsound practices.
Transactions with Affiliates of Oritani Bank. Transactions between an insured bank, such as Oritani Bank, and any of its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and implementing regulations. An affiliate of an insured bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. Generally, a subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution or financial subsidiary is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B.
Section 23A:
 
  
• | limits the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such bank’s capital stock and retained earnings, and limits all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and retained earnings; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions. Further, most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100% to 130% of the loan amounts. There is a general prohibition on the purchase of a low quality asset from an affiliate. In addition, any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by a bank from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate.
 
Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Banks are subject to the prohibitions of 12 U.S.C. Section 1972 on certain tying arrangements. A depository institution is prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
Privacy Standards. FDIC regulations require Oritani Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares “non-public personal information,” of customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. Oritani Bank does not share “non-public personal information” with third parties.
 
In addition, Oritani Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to “opt-out” of having Oritani Bank share their non-public personal information with unaffiliated third parties before they can disclose such information, subject to certain exceptions.
 
The FDIC and other federal banking agencies adopted guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. The guidelines describe the agencies’ expectations for the creation, implementation and maintenance of an information security program, which would include administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities. The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.

Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All FDIC insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In connection with its examination of a state chartered savings bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institution’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. Among other things, the current Community Reinvestment Act regulations replace the prior process-based assessment factors with an evaluation system that rates an institution based on its actual performance in meeting community needs. In particular, the current evaluation system focuses on three tests:

• | a lending test, to evaluate the institution’s record of making loans in its service areas;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an investment test, to evaluate the institution’s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a service test, to evaluate the institution’s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



An institution’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in an inability to receive regulatory approval for certain activities such as branching and acquisitions. Oritani Bank received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in our most recently completed federal examination, which was conducted by the FDIC in 2018.
 
In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
 
Loans to a Bank’s Insiders
 
Federal Regulation. A bank’s loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of more than 10% or more of its stock (each, an insider) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such persons (an insider’s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulations. Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider’s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, which is comparable to the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to Oritani Bank. See “New Jersey Banking Regulation-Loans-to-One Borrower Limitations.” All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders’ related interests in the aggregate generally may not exceed the bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer’s children and certain loans secured by the officer’s primary residence, may not exceed the lesser of (1) $100,000 or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 2.5% of the bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Federal regulation also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested directors not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider’s related interests, would exceed either (1) $500,000 or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus.
 
Generally, loans to insiders must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons. An exception is made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank.
 
In addition, federal law prohibits extensions of credit to a bank’s insiders and their related interests by any other institution that has a correspondent banking relationship with the bank, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
 
New Jersey Regulation. Provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act impose conditions and limitations on the liabilities to a savings bank of its directors and executive officers and of corporations and partnerships controlled by such persons that are comparable in many respects to the conditions and limitations imposed on the loans and extensions of credit to insiders and their related interests under federal law, as discussed above. The New Jersey Banking Act also provides that a savings bank that is in compliance with federal law is deemed to be in compliance with such provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act.
Other Regulations
 
Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Oritani Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Oritani Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:

• | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The operations of Oritani Bank also are subject to the:
 
  
• | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Title III of The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (referred to as the “USA PATRIOT Act”), which significantly expanded the responsibilities of financial institutions, including savings banks, in preventing the use of the U.S. financial system to fund terrorist activities. Among other provisions, the USA PATRIOT Act and the related regulations of the FRB require savings associations operating in the United States to develop new anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations; and

• | The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which placed limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.

Holding Company Regulation
 
General. Oritani Financial Corp. is a non-diversified savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the HOLA. As such, Oritani Financial Corp. is registered with the Federal Reserve Board and subject to Federal Reserve Board regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Oritani Financial Corp and its subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution. As a Delaware corporation, Oritani Financial Corp. is generally subject to state business organization laws. Oritani Financial Corp. is subject to the requirements of Delaware law that generally limit dividends to an amount equal to the difference between the amount by which total assets exceed total liabilities and the amount equal to the aggregate par value of the outstanding shares of capital stock. If there is no difference between these amounts, dividends are limited to net income for the current and/or preceding year. The rights of the stockholders of Oritani Financial Corp. are governed by the Delaware General Corporate Law.
Permitted Activities. Pursuant to the HOLA and federal regulations and policy, a savings and loan holding company such as Oritani Financial Corp. may generally engage in the activities permitted for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act and certain other activities that have been authorized for savings and loan holding companies by regulation.
 
The HOLA prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including Oritani Financial Corp., directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or holding company thereof, without prior regulatory approval. It also prohibits the acquisition or retention of, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by the HOLA, or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
 
Any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state is prohibited, subject to two exceptions:
 
  
(i) | the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions.
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Qualified Thrift Lender Test. In order for Oritani Financial Corp. to continue to be regulated as a savings and loan holding company (rather than as a bank holding company), Oritani Bank must qualify as a “qualified thrift lender” under federal law or satisfy the “domestic building and loan association” test under the Internal Revenue Code. The qualified thrift lender test requires that a savings institution maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” (total assets less: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (ii) intangible, including goodwill; and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed and related securities) in at least nine out of each 12 month period. Oritani Bank currently maintains the majority of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and has met the qualified thrift lender test in each of the last 12 months.
Capital. Until recently, Savings and loan holding companies were not subject to specific regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to depository institutions themselves.  The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implements the Dodd-Frank Act's directive as to savings and loan holding companies.  The consolidated regulatory capital requirements applied to savings and loan holding companies to the same extent as bank holding companies as of January 1, 2015.  As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer is being phased in between 2016 and 2019.
Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has issued regulations requiring that all bank and savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.
Dividends. Oritani Bank must notify the Federal Reserve Board thirty days before declaring any dividend to the Company. The Federal Reserve Board may object to the payment of the dividend if it deems it to be unsafe or unsound or violative of a law, regulation or order or if the institution will be undercapitalized after the dividend. An inability of the subsidiary institution to pay dividends may restrict the parent savings and loan holding company's ability to pay dividends.

With respect to the payment of dividends by Oritani Financial Corp., the Federal Reserve Board has issued a supervisory letter regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies that it has also made applicable to savings and loan holding companies. In general, the supervisory letter provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The guidance provides for prior Federal Reserve Board review of capital distributions in certain circumstances, such as where the company's net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund a dividend or the company's overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company's capital needs and overall financial condition. Stock repurchases are also subject to prior regulatory review under certain circumstances. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Oritani Financial Corp. to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions. The financial impact of a holding company on its subsidiary institution is a matter that is evaluated by the regulator and the agency has authority to order cessation of activities or divestiture of subsidiaries deemed to pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the institution.
Acquisition. Under the Federal Change in Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a savings and loan holding company. Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found that the acquisition will not result in control of the company. A change in control definitively occurs upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock. Under the Change in Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Certain acquisitions of control of a New Jersey savings bank or its parent company require the prior approval of the NJDOBI.

FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION
 
Federal Taxation
 
General. Oritani Financial Corp. and Oritani Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below.  On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act").  Among numerous provisions included in the Act was the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Oritani Financial Corp. or Oritani Bank.
Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Oritani Financial Corp. currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal and state income tax returns.
Bad Debt Reserves. Historically, Oritani Bank has been subject to special provisions in the tax law regarding allowable tax bad debt deductions and related reserves. Tax law changes were enacted in 1996, pursuant to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”), that eliminated the use of the percentage of taxable income method for tax years after 1995 and required recapture into taxable income over a six year period of all bad debt reserves accumulated after 1988. Oritani Bank recaptured its reserve balance over the six-year period ended December 31, 2003.
 
Currently, the Oritani Bank consolidated group uses the specific charge-off method to account for bad debt deductions for income tax purposes.

Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income should Oritani Bank fail to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests.
 
At June 30, 2019, our total federal pre-base year reserve was approximately $15.1 million.  However, under current law, pre-base year reserves remain subject to recapture should Oritani Bank make certain non-dividend distributions, repurchase any of its stock, pay dividends in excess of tax earnings and profits, or cease to maintain a bank charter.
 
Alternative Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") imposes an alternative minimum tax ("AMT") at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences ("alternative minimum taxable income" or "AMTI"). The AMT is payable to the extent such AMTI is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the regular income tax. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of AMTI. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. Oritani Financial Corp. and Oritani Bank have not been subject to the AMT and have no such amounts available as credits for carryover.  As a result of the Act, AMT was eliminated effective January 1, 2018.
Net Operating Loss Carryforward. A financial institution may carry back net operating losses (“NOL”) to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years.  At June 30, 2019, Oritani Bank had no net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes.  As a result of the Act, NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 can no longer be carried back but can be carried forward indefinitely.
State Taxation
 
New Jersey State Taxation. Oritani Financial Corp. and its subsidiaries file New Jersey Corporation Business income tax returns on a calendar year basis.  Generally, New Jersey income, which is calculated based on federal taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, is subject to New Jersey tax.  New Jersey corporate tax is imposed in an amount equal to the corporate business tax ("CBT") at 9% of taxable income or the minimum tax due per entity, whichever is greater.  However, if Oritani Investment Corp, a subsidiary of the Bank, meets certain requirements, it may be eligible to elect to be taxed as a New Jersey Investment Company, which would allow it to be taxed at a rate of 3.6%.  On July 1, 2018, the State of New Jersey enacted new legislation that imposes a temporary surtax of 2.5% for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019, and of 1.5% for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021.  The legislation also requires combined filing for members of an affiliated group for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2019, changing New Jersey’s current status as a separate return state.  In addition, the legislation modifies the dividends-received deduction for tax years beginning after December 31, 2016 by reducing the amount of the exclusion from 100 percent to 95 percent for 80% or more owned subsidiaries.
New York State Taxation. Oritani Financial Corp. files New York State tax returns on a calendar year basis.  New York State imposes a corporate income tax, based on net income allocable to New York State at a rate of 6.5%.  In addition, New York State imposes a tax surcharge allocable to business activities carried on in the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District.
New York City Taxation. Oritani Financial Corp. is also subject to the New York City Financial Corporation Tax calculated, subject to a New York City income and expense allocation, on a similar basis as the New York State Tax, at a rate of 8.85%.
Delaware State Taxation. As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, the Company is exempt from Delaware corporate income tax but is required to file annual returns and pay annual fees and a franchise tax to the state of Delaware.
 
The Company's New York state tax return for the tax years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 was audited during fiscal year 2018.  The Company’s New Jersey, New York City, and Delaware returns are not currently under audit and have not been subject to an audit in the past five years.
