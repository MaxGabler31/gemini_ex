Company Overview
 
Immune Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Company”) was initially incorporated in Florida on December 2, 1993 as Resort Clubs International, Inc. (“Resort Clubs”). It was formed to manage and market golf course properties in resort markets throughout the United States. Galliano International Ltd. (“Galliano”) was incorporated in Delaware on May 27, 1998 and began trading in November 1999 through the filing of a 15C-211. On November 10, 2004, Galliano merged with Resort Clubs. Resort Clubs was the surviving corporation. On August 23, 2010, Resort Clubs changed its name to pH Environmental Inc. (“pH Environmental”).
 
On April 23, 2012, pH Environmental completed a name change to TNI BioTech, Inc., and on April 24, 2012, we executed a share exchange agreement for the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of TNI BioTech IP, Inc. On September 4, 2014, a majority of our shareholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, to change our name to Immune Therapeutics, Inc. We filed our name change amendment with the Secretary of State of Florida on October 27, 2014 changing our name to Immune Therapeutics, Inc.
 
The Company currently operates out of Orlando, Florida. In July 2012, the Company’s focus turned to acquiring patents that would protect and advance the development of new uses of opioid-related immune- therapies, such as low dose naltrexone (“LDN”) and Methionine [Met5]-enkephalin (“MENK”). The Company’s therapies are believed to stimulate and/or regulate the immune system in such a way that they provide the potential to treat a variety of diseases. We believe our therapies may be able to correct abnormalities or deficiencies in the immune system in diseases such as HIV infection, autoimmune disease, immune disorders, or cancer; all of which can lead to disease progression and life-threatening situations when the immune system is not functioning optimally.
 
In October 2012, the Company formed TNI BioTech International, Ltd., a BVI company in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, which was set up to allow the Company to market and sell LDN in those countries outside the U.S. in which we have been able to obtain approval to sell the Company’s products.
 
In August 2013, the Company formed its United Kingdom subsidiary, TNI BioTech, LTD (the “UK Subsidiary”). The UK Subsidiary received approval to be considered a micro, small or medium-sized enterprise (“SME”) with the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) on August 21, 2013. The designation provides the UK Subsidiary with significant discounts when holding meetings or submitting filings to the EMA. On September 19, 2013, the UK Subsidiary submitted a pre-submission package to the EMA regarding Crohn’s Disease. The EMA granted the UK Subsidiary a meeting that took place on September 27, 2013. The UK Subsidiary is eligible to benefit from the provisions for administrative and financial assistance for SMEs set out in Regulation (EC) No 2049/2005. The Company will apply to obtain EMA benefits once funding becomes available.
 
In December 2013, the Company formed a subsidiary, Cytocom Inc., to focus on conducting LDN and MENK clinical trials in the United States. In December 2014, the Company finalized the distribution of common stock of Cytocom Inc. to its shareholders. As part of the transaction, the Company transferred to Cytocom certain of its rights, title and interest in or relating to intellectual property (i) patents, patent applications, and all divisional, continuations and continuations-in-part thereof, together with all reissues, reexaminations, renewals and extensions thereof and all rights to obtain such divisionals, continuations and continuations-in-part, reissues, reexaminations, renewals and extensions, and all utility models and statutory invention registrations and any other such analogous rights, (ii) trademarks, service marks, Internet domain names, trade dress, trade styles, logos, trade names, services names, brand names, corporate names, assumed business names and general intangibles and other source identifiers of a like nature, together with the goodwill associated with any of the foregoing, and all registrations and applications for registrations thereof, together with all renewals and extensions thereof and all rights to obtain such renewals and extensions, (iii) copyrights, mask work rights, database and design rights, moral rights and rights in Internet websites, whether registered or unregistered and whether published or unpublished, all registrations and recordings thereof and all applications in connection therewith, together with all renewals, continuations, reversions and extensions thereof and all rights to obtain such renewals, continuations, reversions and extensions, and (iv) confidential and proprietary information, including, trade secrets and know-how. Cytocom licensed back to the Company a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license to use the assigned intellectual property for veterinary indications and for the marketing rights to emerging markets, access to all clinical data, use of the formulation for LDN and MENK. The parties have informally agreed that until such time as Cytocom was funded, the Company would be responsible for all payments to employees, ongoing general and administrative expenses, licensing fees, patent fees, and drug development costs. When Cytocom becomes self-sustaining and fully funded, it expects to reimburse the Company for all funds spent by the Company since the spin-out.
 
On December 8, 2014, the number of Cytocom Inc. shares of common stock that were issued to our shareholders totaled 113,242,522 shares. In connection with the transaction, Cytocom Inc. issued 140,100,000 shares of its common stock to the Company, which gave the Company a 55.3% stake in Cytocom Inc. on that date. In April 2016, the Board of Directors and a majority of shareholders of Cytocom approved a reverse stock split of Cytocom’s outstanding common stock with one new share of stock for each twenty old shares of common stock. Cytocom effectuated and finalized the reverse split in June 2016. At December 31, 2017, the Company’s equity interest had been further reduced to 9.3%, by subsequent issuances of Cytocom common stock.

In March 2014, the Company incorporated Airmed Biopharma Limited, an Irish corporation with an address in Dublin, Ireland, and Airmed Holdings Limited, an Irish company domiciled in Bermuda. The Irish companies were set up to benefit from incentives granted by the Irish government for the establishment of pharmaceutical companies (many of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies have located in Ireland), and so that the Company could take advantage of Ireland’s status as a member of the European Union and the European Economic Area. An Irish limited liability company enjoys a low corporate income tax rate of 12.5%, one of the lowest in the world. The Irish-domiciled company hopes to qualify for tax incentives for Irish holding/headquartered companies and to benefit from the network of double tax treaties that reduce withholding taxes. TNI BioTech International, Ltd. will manage our international distribution, using product that is manufactured in Ireland and elsewhere.
 
Today, Immune Therapeutics is focused on the commercialization of affordable non-toxic immunotherapies focused on the activation and rebalancing of the body’s immune system. Stimulating the body’s immune system remains one of the most promising approaches in the treatment of Cancers, HIV, Autoimmune Diseases, inflammatory conditions and other opportunistic infections for chronic often life-threatening diseases through the mobilization of the body’s immune system in Emerging Nations using existing clinical data.
 
Cytocom Inc, is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of the first affordable non-toxic immunodulator for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, immune-related disorders, and cancer and is responsible for the development of our patented therapies with the FDA and EMA.
 
As of this date, neither we nor our collaboration partners are permitted to market our drug candidates in the United States until we receive approval of a New Drug Application from the FDA. Neither we nor our collaboration partners have submitted an application for or received marketing approval for any of our drug candidates. Obtaining approval of an NDA can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process.
 
Some of the Company’s more substantial risks include, but are not limited to, its lack of operating history, its high needs for capital, strict government regulation, risk of law suits from trial participants and otherwise, requirement for drug approvals which may never occur, changes in the industry, failure of the Company’s products to make it through trials, reliance on third parties to conduct trials and manufacture and distribute the Company’s drugs, and fierce competition. All of these factors and more could affect investors’ investments in the Company.
 
The Company is a clinical late stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development two immunomodulating therapies - IRT-103 Low-Dose Naltrexone, LDN or “LodonalTM,” and IRT-101 Methionine Enkephalin or “MENK” - for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, cancer and HIV/AIDs. Our product candidates are also intended to combine with other mechanisms of action across the oncology and autoimmune landscape including chemotherapy radiation, and immunosupressive drugs. 
 
Current treatments for autoimmune disease are hampered by the non-specificity of immunomodulatory interventions, having to accept broad suppression of immunoresponsiveness with potentially serious side effects, such as infection or malignancy. 
 
The development of antigen-specific approaches, downregulating pathogenic immune responses while maintaining protective immunity, would be a major step forward. Clinical trials with our immunomodulating therapies have been shown to bolster immune response without the serious side effects of existing therapies. 
 
In clinical trials, Lodonal has been shown to modulate the immune system by increasing the production of T cells, which block TLR signaling and decrease glial cell activation, decrease cytokines, decrease neuroinflammation, modulate T and B lymphocyte production, and shift of immune response from TH2 to TH1 to increase the benefit to patients. Lodonal potentially places the Company at a central place in the treatment paradigm, including Crohn’s Disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), HIV/AIDs and Chronic Pain due to inflammation.

LDN and MENK work by triggering a number of receptors, including the opioid and T Cell receptors on immune cells, which then activate or balance various cells of the immune system. Other receptors triggered by IRT-101 include tolling receptors to shift Th1 (pro-inflammatory) to Th2 (anti-inflammatory), which is critical when dealing with autoimmune and inflammatory disease. 
 
While traditional drug development targets each drug to a particular disease, such as drug A for disease A, drug B for disease B, etc., we are approaching the process by identifying and targeting survival or activation immunology pathways that cross over between different disease indication. Lodonal, our lead product, has shown the success of this model with the approval for use in Nigeria as an immune system regulator in the management of HIV patients. 
 
Lodonal/LDN
 
IRT-103/Lodonal/LDN is an immune modulating drug “IMD” that inhibits Toll-Like receptors including TLR2, TRL4 and TRL9 as well as p receptors to mediated inflammation. In addition to binding to Toll Like receptors, IRT-103 works on the body’s natural opioid system to restore immune balance by Shifting Th1 (pro-inflammatory) to Th2 (anti-inflammatory-). Through its effect on the opiate receptor, IRT-103 has been shown to increase production of Natural Kills Cells, Helper T-Cell CD4, CD8, T-Cells and cytokine production. IRT-103 has completed over 40 Phase II clinical trials that have provided proof of concept for Crohn’s Disease, Fibromyalgia, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, Diabetic Neuropathy and Neuropathic Corneal Pain, Hematologic Cancer Patients, Advanced Brain Tumor. At this time the Company is only focused on developing treatments for HIV/AIDS and Crohn’s Disease. 
 
The Company plans to initiate a Phase 3 study in Moderate to Severe Crohn’s Disease as an adjunct to the standard of care in patients ages 12 and over, using 505(b)(2) pathway study in children with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease. The Company met recently with the FDA to review the planned study. In addition to the trials for Crohn’s Disease, the Company plans to file for a New Drug Application for Crohn’s Disease in patients with HIV/AIDS as HIV patients are unable to use the existing therapies. Currently, IMUN is marketing LDN in Nigeria where it has obtained approval for the management of patients with HIV/AIDS. Since Naltrexone is a repurposed drug with a strong safety profile, we hope we will be able to fast track our development program through the FDA for use in the U.S.
 
IRT-101/MENK
 
Our second product candidate, IRT-101 or MENK, is a member of a group of agents collectively known as “Modulators of Opioid and Receptor Activity.” MENK interacts directly with the OGFr, which, in nonclinical studies, has delayed the cell cycle by modulating cyclin-dependent inhibitory kinase pathways. The IRT-101/MENK axis is an inhibitory pathway that plays a role in the onset and progression of autoimmune diseases, viral diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, and cancer. MENK’s role is to maintain cell growth, function and homeostasis. Exogenous MENK administration has been shown to significantly inhibit growth of multiple cancer cell lines in culture compared to control cells; these cancer types include: thyroid cancer, ovarian cancer, triple negative breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, pancreatic cancer, renal cancer, neuroblastoma, and colon cancer.
 
MENK has established Proof of Concept in HIV/AIDS, Pancreatic Cancer and Kaposi Sarcoma. Clinical Trials suggest activity in treatment of solid tumors, blood cancer, lung and melanoma. 
 
In clinical trials MENK showed significant increase in a subpopulations of individual CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cells (Treg), natural killer cells (NK). Our results indicated that MENK showed a strong inhibiting effect on Treg cells while it stimulated marked proliferation of other lymphocyte subpopulations. MENK when you in conjunction with the standard of care provided evidence of to extend life and most importantly, there were no changes in the blood laboratory tests with MENK. Compared to standard chemotherapy that reduces the blood count from bone marrow toxicity, the blood count remained stable with MENK. Lin E, Freedman JE, Beaulieu LM.

Our Product Pipeline
 
The following table describes our intended product pipeline:
 

Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel immunotherapy treatment of autoimmune diseases, HIV and cancer without the toxic side effects of existing drugs. The Company plans to use Cytocom, Inc. to supervise and perform all development work for Lodonal and MENK that will require approval of the FDA, EMA or any of the G7 countries. The Company will submit all trials and pay fees on Cytocom’s behalf until such time as Cytocom is sufficiently funded to cover the cost of these trials. At this time, the INDs have not been transferred to Cytocom. Studies and trials in countries that are not part of the G7 are being conducted directly by the Company.
 
The key elements of our strategy include:
 

● | Advance the development of LodonalTM for autoimmune diseases. Our short-term focus on finalizing our Phase IIB/III pivotal trials with the FDA. We will have interim analysis (24 weeks post enrollment of final subjects) confirming efficacy of this product in the clinic in these indications. We will file for an New Drug Application and IRB for an exploratory trial leading in patients with HIV/AID’s Once this data is obtained, if compelling we will proceed with Phase 3 confirmatory studies to support NDA submissions with the FDA. As data is obtained in these indications, we will examine the initiation of clinical trials in other autoimmune disorders in which there is nonclinical and/or clinical data to suggest efficacy, such as in patients with MS or fibromyalgia. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Advance the development of IRT-101/MENK for solid tumors. After a Type C meeting with the FDA, we agreed to complete a dosing and PK study in parallel with a Phase 2b clinical trial. Providing Phase 2b data that is statistically robust in patients with solid tumor cancers will assist in confirming efficacy of this product as a therapy or as an adjunct treatment to chemotherapy. Once this data is obtained, we will proceed with Phase 3 confirmatory studies in the appropriate tumor types that will support filing an NDA with the FDA.

The immune system is a network of cells and tissues throughout the human body that work together to protect the body from invasion and/or infection. The immune system consists of two parts: acquired and innate immunity. Acquired immunity is developed by the body as a person ages and the body is exposed to invasions; the body “remembers” these invaders so that it can fight if they return. When the immune system is working properly, foreign invaders provoke the body to activate immune cells against the invaders and to produce antibodies that will recognize and destroy the foreign invaders. Innate immunity activates white blood cells to destroy invaders, without the use of the antibodies. 
 
When a person has an autoimmune disease they have a problem with the acquired immune system’s reactions. In an autoimmune reaction, antibodies and immune cells will target and attack the body’s own healthy tissues. Autoimmune diseases can affect almost any part of the body, including the heart, brain, nerves, muscles, skin, eyes, joints, lungs, kidneys, digestive tract and blood vessels. A typical symptom of an autoimmune disease is inflammation, which can cause redness, heat, pain, and swelling. Many autoimmune diseases don’t restrict themselves to one part of the body and can affect many parts of the body simultaneously. The cause of autoimmune diseases is not fully understood and in most cases, a combination of factors may be the underlying cause.
 
Prevalence rates for all autoimmune disorders are expected to continue to rise in the next several years. Autoimmune diseases represent a diverse collection of diseases in terms of their demographic profile and primary clinical manifestations. There are as many as 80 types of autoimmune diseases. Many of them have similar symptoms, which makes them very difficult to diagnose. It is also possible to have more than one at the same time. They usually fluctuate between periods of remission (little/no symptoms) and flare-ups (worsening symptoms). There are currently no cures for autoimmune diseases, so treatment focuses on relieving the symptoms. 
 
Autoimmune disorders include inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, MS, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, myasthenia gravis and type-1 diabetes. According to a 2015 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), it is estimated 1.3% of U.S. adults (3 million) reported being diagnosed with IBD (either Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis).1. This was a large increase from 1999 (0.9% or 2 million adults).2. According to the CDC, fibromyalgia prevalence in the U.S. affects about 4 million US adults, about 2% of the adult population. The USA had approximately 1.12 million people living with HIV at the end of 2015 (https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/overview/ataglance.html). Nearly one in eight of these people are unaware they have HIV. A crude estimate of the prevalence of myasthenia gravis in the U.S. is approximately 50,000 patients and Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most widespread disabling neurological condition of young adults around the world. The Multiple Sclerosis Foundation estimates that more than 400,000 people in the United States and about 2.5 million people around the world have MS. About 200 new cases are diagnosed each week in the United States. For many of these autoimmune diseases, there is a chronic inflammation without known cause and continuous chronic therapy is required to maintain remission. 
 
Thus, the identification of an alternative, safer therapy prior to the use of medications that hold the potential for severe side effects, like TNF-alpha inhibitors, is very important; especially for those patients who cannot tolerate or who do not want to be placed on such medications. With its excellent safety profile and potential clinical efficacy, LodonalTM may be able to address this unmet medical need as a first line therapy in patients with autoimmune diseases.

Crohn’s Disease, a form of inflammatory bowel disease, is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by transmural, patchy, granulomatous inflammation of the ileum and/or colon, resulting in symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, malabsorption, and weight loss. Crohn’s disease accounts for significant morbidity and decreased quality of life. Although clinical response rates to anti-TNF agents are about 50%, mucosal healing is reported in only approximately 30% of patients with Crohn’s disease (SONIC trial, Colombel, J. F., Sandborn, W. J., Reinisch, W., Mantzaris, G. J., Kornbluth, A., Rachmilewitz, D., Lichtiger, S., D’Haens, G., Diamond, R. H., Broussard, D. L., Tang, K. L., van der Woude, C. J., and Rutgeerts, P. Infliximab, azathioprine, or combination therapy for Crohn’s disease. N.Engl.J.Med. 2010; 362: 1383-1395).Clinical Trials and data have shown that antiretroviral therapy for the treatment of HIV/AID treatments do not fully restore immune health; in fact suppress the immune system as a consequence, a number of inflammation-associated and/or immunodeficiency complications such as cardiovascular disease, chronic infections and cancer are increasing in numbers. Cumulative toxicities from exposure to antiretroviral drugs for decades cause clinically relevant metabolic disturbances and end-organ damage. 
 
There are growing concerns that the multi-morbidity associated with HIV disease may impact healthy aging and could overwhelm some health care systems, particularly those in resource-limited regions that have yet to fully develop a chronic care model. Given the problems inherent in treating and caring for a chronic disease that might persist for several decades, a global effort to identify a cure or a therapy to offset the toxic side effects if needed. 
 
Lodonal™ in clinical trials has shown to provide an alternative and safe approach for immune dysfunction, cancer and chronic inflammatory state. In FDA phase II trials for HIV, Crohn’s Disease, Fibromyalgia, Adjunct to Chemotherapy, MS, RA, that have been proven to increase CD 4 count, decrease viral loads, suppress autoimmune reactions; decrease inflammatory cytokines, slows growth of malignant cells and Increases production of T-Cell, Helper, NK, Toll-Like receptor TRL4 and TRL9 as well as p receptors. Lodonal works on the body’s natural opioid system to restore immune balance by Shifting Th1 (pro-inflammatory) to Th2 (anti-inflammatory). TNI BioTech International, a subsidiary of Immune, received NAFDAC (National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control) approval to market and distribute LodonalTM, the Company’s breakthrough treatment for HIV/AIDS. The Company and its strategic partners received regulatory approvals and contracts for the first sales of the product in Nigeria in 2018.
 
The approval is for a one-day Immune System Regulator for the management of HIV/AIDS, which is based on the results of the Company’s 90-day bridging trial in Nigeria that resulted in a 44% increase in CD4 count versus an 11% increase for standard of care patients. Additionally, there was a reduction in opportunistic infections plus several Phase II multi-center, randomized studies that demonstrated improvements for patients treated with Lodonal™ when compared to placebo or standard of care.
 
MS is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that is characterized by progressive neuronal loss that manifests clinically as worsening physical disability occurs. The key pathophysiological hallmark of MS is the loss of myelin, a layer of lipids and proteins produced by cells called oligodendrocytes that wrap around the neuron and act like an insulating sheath to facilitate electrical conduction along the nerve. Destruction of myelin by an inflammatory cascade leads to neuronal degeneration. As a result, we believe that there is a substantial unmet need for effective treatments for chronic progressive MS as well as a need for therapies that are more conveniently delivered, such as oral agents or less frequently administered injectable drugs.
 
Fibromyalgia is an autoimmune disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. Researchers believe that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain processes pain signals. Symptoms sometimes begin after a physical trauma, surgery, infection or significant psychological stress. In other cases, symptoms gradually accumulate over time with no single triggering event. Women are much more likely to develop fibromyalgia than are men. Many people who have fibromyalgia also have tension headaches, temporomandibular joint disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety and depression. While there is no cure for fibromyalgia, a variety of medications can help control symptoms. Most of those drugs are immuno-suppression drugs with numerous side effects.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune neuromuscular disease that leads to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue. The hallmark symptom of myasthenia gravis is muscle weakness that increases during periods of activity and improves after periods of rest. Certain muscles such as those that control eye and eyelid movement, facial expressions, chewing, talking, and swallowing are often involved in the disorder. The muscles that control breathing and neck and limb movements may also be affected. Current therapies help patients to have a normal life expectancy; however, quality of life and relief from symptoms still needs significant improvements in patients with this disease.

Cancer is a term used for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control and these cells have the ability to invade other tissues within the body by traveling through the blood and lymph systems. Cancer consists of many different types of diseases. Currently, there are more than 100 different types of cancer with the majority of cancers named for the organ or type of cell in which they start. For example, cancer that begins in the colon is called colon cancer. Cancer can also be grouped into broader categories, which include:

● | Carcinoma - cancer that begins in the skin or in tissues that line or cover internal organs; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Sarcoma - cancer that begins in the bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels, or other connective or supportive tissue; 
● | Leukemia - cancer that starts in blood-forming tissue such as the bone marrow and causes large numbers of abnormal blood cells to be produced and enter the blood; 
● | Lymphoma and myeloma - cancers that begin in cells of the immune system; and 
● | Central nervous system cancers - cancers that begin in tissues of the brain and/or spinal cord. 

 
The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2014 over 1.6 million people in the United States are expected to be diagnosed with cancer and over 585,000 people will die from cancer. Cancer remains the second most common cause of death in the U.S. contributing to one in four deaths. As evidence by these numbers, and despite advances in the field of cancer research, there remains a significant unmet medical need in the treatment of cancer.
 
A common treatment option for cancer is surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. While these therapies are the most widely used class of anti-cancer agents, they are associated with extremely high levels of toxicity, potentially severe adverse events and at times a lack of efficacy. As a result, there is a substantial unmet medical need for alternatives or adjunct treatments to existing chemotherapy drugs and/or radiation therapy in order to address the associated toxicities and lack of efficacy from these drugs.
 
Background
 
Naltrexone is short for Naltrexone Hydrochloride and is an orally effective opioid receptor antagonist, used as a treatment for opiate addiction. Naltrexone was originally synthesized in 1963 and was originally patented in 1967 by the specialty pharmaceutical company Endo Health Solutions Inc. At the time, it seemed unlikely that naltrexone would be developed because the experimental drug had relatively low market potential, and naltrexone’s patent protection would likely expire before the completion of clinical trials. With the assistance of DuPont, a division of Merck & Co. that acquired Endo Health Solutions, Inc. in 1969, the U.S. government’s National Institute on Drug Abuse advanced naltrexone through the FDA approval process, leading to approval for marketing as a treatment for heroin addiction in a 50 mg dose in 1984. Although its patent expired that same year, Naltrexone gained seven additional years of marketing exclusivity for DuPont when the FDA designated it an orphan drug.

11 | P a g e
------------

 

Marketing exclusivity provides a pharmaceutical company the right to sell its drug for a certain length of time free of competition from generic versions of the drug and is often granted to encourage companies to develop a use for a drug whose patent has expired or to encourage a company to develop an already approved drug for a new use. With market exclusivity, the anticipated returns on investment are higher, improving the profitability of a drug. With funding provided by the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the potential to gain three additional years of post-approval market exclusivity for naltrexone, DuPont advanced naltrexone through additional clinical trials, and gained FDA approval for a 50 mg dose as a treatment for alcohol abuse in 1995. As naltrexone had already been on the market for 10 years as a treatment for heroin addiction, the FDA’s confidence in its safety resulted in approval only six months after naltrexone’s regulatory application was submitted.
 
Naltrexone has a black box warning for liver toxicity, which is included based on liver enzyme elevations reported with daily dosing at 100 mg-300 mg. These doses were evaluated in clinical trials conducted by third parties for obesity; however, they have not been approved for this use. Review of the literature and adverse effect reports in naltrexone clinical trials did not demonstrate a risk for liver damage with daily dosing at 50 mg or lower. Although the black box warning does remain, the FDA has stated that Naltrexone does not appear to be a hepatotoxin at the recommended doses for the currently approved indications. Other than its small potential association with liver toxicity at high doses, the most common adverse effects reported with naltrexone are non-specific gastrointestinal complaints such as diarrhea, mild nausea, and abdominal cramping. Naltrexone has not shown any significant increase in adverse effects in placebo-controlled trials in patients known to be free of opioids for at least seven days.
 
At lower doses (approximately 1-10 mg/day), Naltrexone has been termed LDN and has been gaining popularity as a treatment for signs and symptoms of autoimmune diseases and immune disorders such as Crohn’s disease, viral infections such as HIV/AIDS and cancer. Research studies conducted by Dr. Zagon and colleagues at Penn State University have indicated that the short-term blockage of opioid receptors on circulating and tissue cells by administration of LDN was followed by a substantial rebound in opioid receptor expression and increased levels of β-endorphin and met-enkephalin. In addition to Dr. Zagon’s findings, Dr. Bernard Bihari, a New York physician who previously studied immune responses primarily in AIDs patients, provided a 3-fold mechanistic approach to the use of LDN, showing that LDN administration has the following effects on the immune system:
 

● | Increase in met-enkephalin (an endorphin produced in large amounts in the adrenal medulla) and β-endorphin in the blood stream; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increase in the number and density of opiate receptors on the tumor cell membranes, thereby making them more responsive to the growth-inhibiting effects of the already present levels of endorphins, which in turn induces apoptosis in the cancer cells; and 
● | Increase in absolute numbers of circulating cytotoxic T cells (CD8+/TH1) and natural killer cells (“NK cells”) as well as NK cell activity. 

 
To date, Lodonal™ (“low dose naltrexone” and “LDN”) has been administered to patients across multiple indications to include autoimmune diseases and disorders, viral infections and cancer; both under clinical trials and through off-label prescription use. It has been estimated, based upon Dr. Bihari’s research and direct interactions with pharmacies, that just within the U.S. there are approximately 30,000-40,000 people taking Lodonal™ daily. Most of the states in the U.S. have licensed compounding pharmacies to prepare the appropriate formulations of LDN for these indications and at least one compounding pharmacy in the U.S. is licensed to dispense LDN to 48 of the 50 states. 
 
LDN is currently being studied in a number of clinical trials by other companies in the U.S., as is shown in the following tabular summary.
 

Title | Indication | Dose | Status 
-------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+-------+-----------------------
Low Dose Naltrexone for the treatment of Complex Regional Pain | Complex Regional pain | 4.5mg | Recruiting 
Low Dose Naltrexone for Chronic Pain Arthritis | Osteoarthritis Arthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis | 4.5mg | Not yet recruiting

Clinical Data has shown that LDN has the potential to be a successful treatment for immune dysfunction, immune dysregulation, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancer. LDN in HIV/AID’s has shown to slow disease progression, reduce inflammation that cannot only control the disease itself, with no toxic side effects. For example, in Crohn’s disease, five published clinical trials in patients with moderate to severe disease have been conducted, two in adults and one in children, and have shown significant disease and quality of life improvement by 12-weeks. LDN was able to reverse the inflammatory activity, promote mucosal healing, and significantly decrease histologic inflammation when compared to placebo-treated controls.
 
Clinical Trials
 
Significant published clinical trial evidence indicates that LDN, particularly daily dosing at 3mg - 4.5 mg, stimulates the immune system and is effective in the treatment of some immunodeficiency diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, and advanced cancer. In addition, LDN has been used quite widely for treatment of a variety of autoimmune diseases and immune disorders. 
Clinical Trials: Crohn’s Disease
 
The first clinical trial results with LDN for immune disorders were published only recently in a peer-reviewed medical journal in 2007 which evaluated LDN treatment in a pilot Phase II study of 17 patients with moderate to severe, active Crohn’s disease. The open-label pilot study was conducted by Penn State University to evaluate LDN response, safety and toxicity. Patients were treated with LDN orally each evening at a dose of 4.5 mg for 3 months. A total of 17 patients were enrolled, 16 of whom completed the study. No laboratory abnormalities were noted. The most common side effect was sleep disturbances (occurred when dosing at night, at about bed-time), occurring in seven patients (41%). Two-thirds of patients in this study went into remission after 4.5 mg daily LDN treatment (p < 0.001), with 89% of patients overall showing some degree of response. Blood inflammatory markers were also analyzed, specifically c-reactive protein, or c-RP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or ESR. C-RP levels decreased from a median value of 2.6 (normal <0.8) at baseline to a value of 0.9 by the twelfth week of treatment, which was statistically significant (p = 0.03). The ESR decreased from a mean baseline value of 23.3 ± 0.4 mm/h to 17.9 ± 0.3 mm/h, which was also significant (p = 0.04). Baseline plasma enkephalin levels were 9.5 ± 2.8 pg/mL, and decreased to a value of 3.6±1.0 pg/mL at week 12 of LDN therapy.
 
A second clinical study was conducted by Penn State University as a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study to test the efficacy and safety of LDN for 12 weeks in adults with moderate to severe active Crohn’s disease. Forty subjects were enrolled in the study. Randomized patients received daily oral administration of LDN (4.5 mg/day) or placebo. Fatigue was the only side effect reported of statistical significance, and it was greater in subjects receiving placebo. Thirty percent of patients in this study went into remission (defined as a Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (“CDAI”) score ≤ 150), with 88% of patients overall showing some degree of response. Blood inflammatory markers, c-RP and ESR, were analyzed. Patients who exhibited a 70-point drop in CDAI scores with LDN had higher c-RP values at baseline (2.0 ± 0.5 mg/dl) compared to those subjects on LDN who did not exhibit a response (0.8 ± 0.3 mg/dl); however, this difference was not statistically significant (all values were included in the analysis including those subjects who flared during the study). Based upon this data, patients with high c-RP levels may be more likely to demonstrate a clinical response to treatment with LDN.

A pilot Phase II clinical trial was conducted by Penn State University in children with moderate to severe active Crohn’s disease. Fourteen subjects were enrolled, 12 subjects were randomized and treated with a mean age of 12.3 years (range 8-17 years). Children were randomized to placebo or LDN (0.1 mg/kg or a maximum dose of 4.5 mg) orally for 8 weeks followed by open-label treatment for an additional 8 weeks of LDN at the same dose of 0.1 mg/kg or 4.5 mg. Results showed a significantly greater reduction of baseline pain in those taking LDN than in those taking placebo (28.8% reduction versus 18.0% reduction; p = 0.016). LDN was also associated with improved general satisfaction with life (p = 0.045) and with improved mood (p = 0.039), but not improved fatigue or sleep. Thirty-two percent of participants met the criteria for response (defined as a significant reduction in pain plus a significant reduction in either fatigue or sleep problems) during LDN therapy, as contrasted with an 11% response rate during placebo therapy p = 0.05). LDN was rated equally tolerable as placebo and no serious side effects were reported. Laboratory parameters for inflammation, specifically white blood count, c-RP and ESR all improved from baseline to Week eight; however, the results were not significant.
 
An open-label Phase II trial was conducted for Naltrexone as Therapy for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease Twelve patients received naltrexone 4.5 mg/day. Duration (mean ±SD) of naltrexone treatment was 46 ±75 weeks (maximum 270 weeks). One patient withdrew after 8 weeks owing to insomnia. Positive clinical responses were reported in 6/12 patients. Two clinical responders had colonoscopy before and after naltrexone and each had complete mucosal healing. (Leonard B.

Clinical Trials: HIV/AIDS
 
A single blind 90 day with 4 week f/u randomized completed a 90-day bridging trial for the treatment of patients with HIV AIDS. The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) approval is based on previous clinical data and the Nigeria Bridging Trial. The trial was a single center, open labeled, randomized, bridging study consisting of one hundred and fifty [150] patients of both genders between the ages of 18-60, each of whom was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
 
The 90-Day Bridging Trial was undertaken at the State Specialist Hospital in Asubiaro, Osogbo, Osun State, Nigeria with the primary objective to confirm Lodonal™ has a beneficial effect on the immune system of immune deficient patients and that it is safe. The trial separated the patients into a Control (placebo) Group and a Treatment Group (which was administered Lodonal™). The efficacy of increasing CD4 count [cell/mm3] between Day-1 and Day-90 by at least 25% was set as the criteria for demonstrating beneficial effect on the immune system. Safety was demonstrated through quality of life assessment and vitals both of which were not adversely affected. Treatment Group patients were given a daily dose of 4.5-mg/kg of Lodonal™.
 

14 | P a g e

The results yielded an average increase of 44% increase in CD4 count in the Lodonal™ Treatment Group compared to an 11% increase in the Control Group. Additionally, there were no reported opportunistic infections and no toxicity levels uncovered. Liver function remained normal and there was no negative impact on other systems based on blood results. No significant sleep disturbance or vivid dreams were present enough to justify trial discontinuation. No significant adverse CNS, renal, cardiac, hepatic, musculoskeletal, hematopoietic side effects were present. NAFDAC issued drug and marketing approval of Lodonal™ in July of 2017 in the management of HIV/AID’s and immune dysfunction.
 
A single blind nine-month randomize clinical trial and a single prospective cohort study were conducted in Mali to evaluate the impact of LDN on asymptomatic HIV+ adults. Results of the nine-month study showed an improvement in cluster of differentiation 4 (“CD4”) count in the treatment groups that was significantly greater than the control group at 6 months (p = 0.041) and marginally at 9 months (p = 0.067). Results of the single prospective cohort study showed 71% of subjects that completed the study did not show any indication of clinical AIDS symptoms, side effects or a loss of CD4 count that would warrant initiation of antiretroviral therapy (“ART”) medication.
 
A 12-week, placebo-controlled trial of LDN was conducted from 1985-1986 in 38 patients with AIDS by Dr. Bihari and his colleagues. Patients who participated in this trial showed a significant difference in the incidence of opportunistic infections with 5 out of 16 patients (31%) on placebo developing opportunistic infections in comparison to 0 of the 22 patients in the LDN group. Other differences between placebo and LDN treated patients included: lymphocyte mitogen responses declined on placebo and not on LDN; pathologically elevated levels of acid-labile alpha interferon declined significantly in the patients on LDN and not in those patients on placebo.
 
After the conclusion of the above clinical trial, Dr. Bihari began to use LDN in his own medical practice. Of 158 patients in his practice that were evaluated, only ten (6%) were on antivirals. Patients of Dr. Bihari who had taken the drug regularly as prescribed showed no drop in CD4 cells. The average CD4 number in these patients before starting LDN was 358, and the average 18 months later increased to 368. There were 55 patients who had not taken the drug, or had taken it only sporadically (non-compliant). These patients showed a drop of CD4 cells from an average of 297 to 176 in 18 months. This represented a drop in CD4 of approximately 80 per year, which corresponds to the average drop observed in patients with HIV receiving no treatment. The stabilization of CD4 cells in patients who were administered LDN was also accompanied by disease stabilization. The 55 patients who were non-compliant experienced 25 opportunistic infections, in comparison to the 103 compliant patients who only experienced eight. Survival between the two groups was also significantly different, 13 deaths occurred in the 55 non-compliant patients compared to only one death in the compliant group of 103. At the time of this referenced article (Bihari et al., Sept 1996), patients in Dr. Bihari’s practice had been on LDN for seven to eight years, with no disease progression, no drop in CD4 levels and no evidence of resistance to the beneficial effects of LDN. None of the patients experienced side effects while on LDN.
 
Dr. Bihari also examined CD4 changes in 19 patients who were on the combination treatment regimen of 3TC (Epivir), azidothymidine (“AZT”), and LDN. The rise in CD4 counts at 6 months in Dr. Bihari’s patients was compared with the rise in CD4 counts reported by an investigator working for Glaxo Smith Kline. In both groups, none of the patients had taken AZT previously; however, Dr. Bihari’s patients simultaneously were treated with LDN, which the Glaxo Smith Kline group did not receive. The patients on LDN had an average baseline CD4 count of 88 while the Glaxo Smith Kline group had an average baseline value of 352. The Glaxo Smith Kline patients experienced an average rise in CD4 of 40 at six months; or an increase of 11.3%. The LDN patients experienced an average rise of 106 CD4’s at 6 months, representing a 128% increase. Of the 19 LDN patients, each patient experienced an increase of at least 30%. In 18 of the 19 LDN patients, a significant increase in energy, appetite and mood was observed. In those LDN patients who were severely underweight, weight gains of ten to 50 pounds were observed in the first two months of treatment.

Clinical Trials: Fibromyalgia
 
LDN has been utilized in a number of trials to investigate its use for the treatment of fibromyalgia. Studies conducted to date in adult patients have typically used an LDN dose of 4.5 mg/day in comparison to placebo.
 
LDN was assessed for the treatment of fibromyalgia, in a single-blind, crossover trial in which ten women were enrolled. This study utilized the following treatment schedule: Baseline (2 weeks) →Placebo (2 weeks) → LDN 4.5 mg/day (8 weeks) →Washout (2 weeks) LDN reduced fibromyalgia symptoms in the entire cohort, with a greater than 30% reduction of symptoms over placebo. As observed in other studies with LDN, side effects were rare, minor and transient, and included sleep disturbances such as insomnia and vivid dreams.
 
In a second study, 31 women with fibromyalgia participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced, crossover study. During the active drug phase of the study, participants were administered oral LDN at a dose of 4.5 mg daily. This study showed a benefit with LDN in comparison to placebo for the treatment of fibromyalgia. A significantly greater reduction of baseline pain was observed in those taking LDN in comparison with those taking placebo (28.8% reduction versus 18.0% reduction). LDN was also associated with improved general satisfaction with life and with improved mood. Thirty-two percent (32%, n=9) of participants met the criteria for response (defined by the study as at least a 30% reduction in pain, plus a 30% reduction in fatigue or a 30% improvement in sleep) during LDN therapy, as contrasted with an 11% (n=3) response rate during placebo therapy. Both LDN and placebo were tolerated equally and no serious adverse events were reported.
 
Clinical Trials: MS
 
A PILOT TRIAL OF LOW-DOSE NALTREXONE IN PRIMARY PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS was run at the University of Pennsylvania by Dr. Ian Zagon and Pat McLaughlin:
 
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of 4.5mg nightly naltrexone on the quality of life of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.
 
METHOD: A sixth month phase II multicenter-pilot trial with a low dose of the opiate antagonist Naltrexone (LDN) has been carried out in 40 patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). The primary end points were safety and tolerability. Secondary outcomes were efficacy on spasticity, pain, fatigue, depression, and quality of life. Clinical and biochemical evaluations were serially performed. Protein concentration of beta-endorphins (BE) and mRNA levels and allelic variants of the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) were analyzed.
 
RESULTS: Five dropouts and two major adverse events occurred. The remaining adverse events did not interfere with daily living. Neurological disability progressed in only one patient. A significant reduction of spasticity was measured at the end of the trial. BE concentration increased during the trial, but no association was found between OPRM1 variants and improvement of spasticity. The data indicates that LDN is safe and well tolerated in patients with PPMS.
 
PILOT TRIAL ON LOW-DOSE NALTREXONE AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS:
 
OBJECTIVE: evaluate the efficacy of 4.5mg nightly naltrexone on the quality of life of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.
 
METHODS: This single-center, double-masked, placebo-controlled, crossover study evaluated the efficacy of 8 weeks of treatment with 4.5mg nightly naltrexone (low-dose naltrexone, LDN) on self-reported quality of life of MS patients.

16 | P a g e
------------

 

RESULTS: Eighty subjects with clinically definite MS were enrolled, and 60 subjects completed the trial. Ten withdrew before completing the first trial period: 8 for personal reasons, 1 for a non-MS-related adverse event, and 1 for perceived benefit. Database management errors occurred in 4 other subjects, and quality of life surveys were incomplete in 6 subjects for unknown reasons. The high rate of subject dropout and data management errors substantially reduced the trial’s statistical power. LDN was well tolerated, and serious adverse events did not occur. LDN was associated with significant improvement on the following mental health quality of life measures: a 3.3-point improvement on the Mental Component Summary score of the Short Form-36 General Health Survey (p = 0.04), a 6-point improvement on the Mental Health Inventory (p < 0.01), a 1.6-point improvement on the Pain Effects Scale (p =. 04), and a 2.4-point improvement on the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire (p = 0.05). LDN significantly improved mental health quality of life indices. Further studies with LDN in MS are warranted.
 
A PILOT TRIAL OF LOW-DOSE NALTREXONE IN PRIMARY PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS:
 
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of 4.5mg nightly naltrexone on the quality of life of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients some with relapsing-remitting MS and some with secondary progressive MS.
 
METHODS: This single-center, placebo-controlled, study evaluated the efficacy of 17 weeks of treatment with 4.5mg nightly naltrexone (low-dose naltrexone, LDN) on self-reported quality of life of MS patients.
 
RESULTS: The results on LDN’s effect on quality of life (as measured by physical and mental health) was not clearly proven, with no statistically significant differences shown between the LDN-dosed group and the placebo group many have argued the reason for the problem with this trial was the crossover design which have shown in the past not to provide good results when treating with LDN. Data indicates that LDN is safe and well tolerated in patients with PPMS.
 
RETROSPECTIVE CHART REVIEW OF MS PATIENTS RECEIVING LOW DOSE NALTREXONE (LDN) TO ASSESS SAFETY, TOLERABILITY, AND EFFECT ON FATIGUE:
 
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the safety, tolerability, and benefits (fatigue, reduction) of LDN in patients with MS. It reviewed the number of patients who stopped taking LDN and if there were specific reasons for stopping the LDN. The frequency and variety of side effects that were specific to LDN use are reported.
 
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on 435 charts of MS patients who were seen in the Penn State Hershey out- patient Multiple Sclerosis Clinic between 1/1/2005 and 5/31/2012. There were 215 MS patients having exposure to LDN during the time of this study. RESULTS: The study confirmed an improvement in quality of life with the use of LDN over a long period of time. In addition to the assessment we review Brain MRIs and Spinal Cord MRIs that were obtained as part of the clinical status of the patient and standard of care. There were essentially no MRIs obtained immediately before LDN was started as would have been ideal in a prospective study. The average number of days of the Brain MRI before treatment with LDN was started was 444 days with a maximum of 4751 days. The average number of days to the latest Brain MRI after LDN was started was 708 with a maximum of 1772 days of 215 patients on LDN 113 MRI scans showed stable, 14 showed improvement, 28 slightly worse. The Slightly Worse MRI series indicated that new but inactive lesion(s) were identified when compared to the pretreatment study MRI. On the quality of life surveys showed 83 patients said they had improved, 92 patients said they were stable and 9 worse. The remainder of the patients did not continue on LDN.
 
Despite the number of small studies conducted to date, as well as all of the antidotal evidence from patients and doctors that either take LDN for MS or prescribe LDN for MS, Cytocom believes that results are promising, which the Company feels could bode well in larger studies as existing treatments are not every effective.

Our Clinical Trial Program for Lodonal™/LDN
 
The Company held a Type C meeting in January 2018 with the FDA to discuss clinical protocol design and to seek guidance for the clinical development program in the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with Crohn’s disease using a 505(b)(2) pathway to support an NDA. Use of the 505(b)(2) pathway will allow us to seek FDA approval of LodonalTM without the need to conduct a full development program consisting of both safety and efficacy trials. This will help us to shorten our development pathway and time to NDA submission. We plan to rely on the two drugs using naltrexone that have been approved by the FDA. The first drug approved 50 mg product as the reference listed drug, published literature and historical data and all of the historical data from the 50mg trials and to leverage recent Contrave® approval for safety/PK support at 4mg, 6mg and 8mg with approval granted for Naltrexone at 16mg with Wellbutrin to support the Phase II/III clinical trials and the ultimate filing of the NDA as a 505(b)(2) submission to the FDA. To date, nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology data and clinical safety data has been established from these sources, in addition to multiple Phase I/II studies conducted under our INDs.
 
To support the NDA filing, we plan to conduct the following pivotal studies:
 

● | Phase IIb, dose-response study/ies in patients with specific autoimmune disease(s); that will rollover into our 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase III, randomized, double-blind study/ies based upon Phase IIB results. 

 
If NDA approval of Lodonal is granted, in addition to the patents the FDA grants three-year marketing exclusivity granted by law, we expect this product to be protected by patents that extend through at least 2023 for adults 7 year exclusive rights from date of approval for pediatric Crohn’s disease due to orphan indication. During which time it should not be subject to generic substitution. We plan to continue to support the Lodonal program with new patent applications as we obtain data from the clinical evaluation of our new formulation in healthy human subjects and in patients.
 
If the Phase 2B study of Lodonal is successful, we expect to quickly rollover into the Phase 3 confirmatory study to support product registration.
 
Based upon the indication chosen, the FDA has stated that a long-term (approximately 1 year) safety study of Lodonal™ will need to be conducted; however, all nonclinical studies to support the safety of the product and NDA submission are complete.
 
Developing LDN using the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway lowers the hurdle for FDA approval. Because naltrexone is an FDA-approved product for alcohol or opiate dependence, the FDA’s 505(b)(2) pathway for approval is available and opens the door for us to gain FDA approval of LDN for new diseases. With the opportunity to use previous findings of safety, we intend to use the 505(b)(2) pathway to study and gain approval for our own product.
 
IRT-101/MENK
 
The role of opioid peptides in cancer cell growth have been examined in both tissue culture models and in vivo studies. These studies have revealed that the pentapeptide MENK, or IRT-101, is the most potent opioid peptide that influences DNA synthesis and cell growth. Because of MENK’s ability to have a direct impact on the growth factor action, MENK has also been termed Opioid Growth Factor (“OGF”). MENK or OGF is an endogenous opioid peptide that interacts with the OGFr, which delays the cell cycle by modulating cyclin-dependent inhibitory kinase pathways. The OGF-OGFr axis is an inhibitory pathway that plays a role in the onset and progression of autoimmune diseases and cancer.
 

18 | P a g e
------------

 

The OGF-OGFr peptide and receptor have been detected in a wide variety of cancers, including thyroid cancer (e.g. follicular-derived thyroid cancers), ovarian cancer, triple negative breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, pancreatic cancer, renal cancer, neuroblastoma, and colon cancer.
 
It has been shown in a number of research studies that the OGF-OGFr axis can be directly targeted by the administration of exogenous MENK. MENK, at suitable doses, can inhibit cancerous cell growth by MENK’s direct interaction with OGFr creating a competitive inhibition profile and subcellular location that is different from other well-known opioid receptors [mu (µ), delta (δ) and kappa (κ)]. The other “classic” opioid receptors [mu (µ), delta (δ) and kappa (κ)] have not been found to have any impact on cell growth; thus there is specificity in the MENK-OGFr interaction which regulates cell proliferation. MENK has been shown to act directly on cells to inhibit proliferation as documented by tissue culture models that lack feedback loops or whole animal autocrine systems. Studies in vitro have shown that MENK has no effects on the apoptosis pathways or cell differentiation.
 
Based upon data from multiple in vivo and in vitro studies conducted by Zagon et al. over the past 15 years, the onset and/or progression of some cancers may be related to defects in MENK and/or OGFr, which would promote or exacerbate tumorigenesis. These findings show there may be an advantage in up-regulating the peptide (e.g., MENK administration) to enhance anti-cancer activity.
 
The Ian Zagon/Patricia McLaughlin-led team at Penn State University has focused their non-clinical in vitro and in vivo research studies on the direct anti-tumor effects of MENK and inhibition of OGFr. These studies have shown that OGFr is required for the action of MENK, and overexpression of OGFr can delay progression, or even prevent appearance of pancreatic tumors in nude mice.
 
The researchers at Penn State University have also demonstrated in tissue culture that the combination of MENK and gemcitabine show a potent inhibitory effect on the growth in vitro of at least two cell lines of human pancreatic cancer. In a mouse xenograft model of pancreatic cancer, the effects of MENK and/or gemcitabine on tumor incidence, appearance, and size, as well as metastasis, were examined in vivo. MIA PaCa-2 cells of human origin (106 cells/mouse) were injected into the right scapular region via a subcutaneous injection followed by treatment within one hour of the injection with MENK, gemcitabine or MENK + gemcitabine. The anti-growth action of the combination of MENK and gemcitabine was greater than that observed with the individual drugs. In a number of instances the effect of the combination of drugs exceeded that of the sum of the individual drugs, suggesting that the action of a combination of MENK and gemcitabine was synergistic.
 
Dr. Nicholas Plotnikoff, while a faculty member at Oral Roberts University, discovered that all three of the classical opioid receptors are expressed on most subsets of immune cells, and that either in vitro incubation with MENK or parenteral administration of MENK in vivo increased the number and functional activities of T cells, including cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and also NK cells. Several other investigators observed that administration of MENK to mice and humans, especially those with immunodeficiencies associated with cancer or HIV/AIDS, increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and increased various immune functions, including cytotoxic activities of both T cells and NK cells. More recently, Drs. Fengping Shan and Nicholas Plotnikoff have reported that MENK treatment of mice stimulates the cytotoxic activities of T cells and NK cells and reduces levels of T regulatory cells, and augments therapeutic effects in tumor-bearing immunocompetent mice. Additional published results show that MENK alone or in combination with Interleukin-2 (“IL -2”) or Interferon-γ (“IFN-γ”) can enhance the production of IFN-γ or IL-2 from CD4+T cells, respectively. MENK also appears to be more potent than IL-2 or IFN-γ, alone, two widely known cytokines that have been approved by the FDA for marketing.
 
Studies in the laboratories of Zagon and McLaughlin have demonstrated that MENK/OGF inhibited in a direct, receptor-mediated, and reversible manner stimulated T and B cells isolated from spleens of normal mice and grown in culture. Thus, the immunomodulatory effects of MENK/OGF appear to result from the repression of proliferative T and B lymphocytes.
 
Research results to date indicate that MENK, at suitable doses, in addition to inhibiting cancerous cell growth, can also boost the immune system through the following possible mechanisms:
 

19 | P a g e
------------


● | increasing proliferation and functional activities of CD4+T-cells and CD8+T-cells which will play a role in anti-virus and anti-tumor activities; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | increasing maturation of dendritic cells which will initiate and intensify T-cell responses; 
● | increasing secretion of cytokines such as IL-2, TNF, IL-12 and IFN-γ which will amplify the T-cell response and mediate interaction among immune cells, forming a modulated and balanced immunity; 
● | increasing functions of macrophages, resulting in enhanced cellular immunity through secreting a set of cytokines; and 
● | increasing activity of NK cells which have the ability to kill cancer cells and virus-infected cells. 

Background
 
Standard therapy for patients with advanced cancer include chemotherapy, or treatment options that are toxic to the cells, that suppress the immune system and carry significant risks of life-threatening infections and other toxicities. Despite effective cancer therapies that induce clinical response, including complete remission, minimal residual disease (“MRD”), a term referring to disease that is undetectable by conventional morphologic methods, often remains and serves as a source of cancer recurrence. For years, scientists have studied ways to enhance the patient’s immune system to target cancer cells, maintain remission and possibly even eradicate all cancer cells in the body. Researchers believe that a cure for cancer might be possible if immunotherapy is successfully applied to the treatment of cancer.
 
The most common immunotherapy studied to date involves the use of targeted humanized monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab (anti-CD20) or trastuzumab (anti-HER2/neu). These antibodies bind targets that are over-expressed on cancer cells and promote cell death by a number of immune mechanisms, including antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (“ADCC”). In ADCC, the most common mechanism of tumor killing, the antibody tags the cancer cell and recruits the cells from the patient’s immune system to attack the tumor. Immune cells recruited by the antibody to kill the cancer include granulocytes, macrophages and NK cells.
 
Another common therapy that activates the innate immune system involves the administration of high dose Interleukin-2, or IL-2. Through binding to the IL-2 receptor, IL-2 activates NK cells to attack cancer cells. After high-dose IL-2 therapy, NK cells are activated to search out and kill cancer cells. Unfortunately, the use of IL-2 therapy is limited because of its severe side effects, which include severe life-threatening infusion reactions and induction of autoimmune disease.
 
The importance of cytokines to NK cells in the host system’s defense against cancer was recognized by Dr. Nicholas Plotnikoff at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa and Dr. Ian Zagon and others from Penn State Medical Center at Hershey where they noted that patients who could mount an immune response to their HIV/AIDS infection or cancer, specifically pancreatic or liver had a higher survival rate compared to standard historical medications used. Researchers identified that a key to the successful immune response of the patient’s immune system was the NK cell. Dr. Zagon and Dr. Plotnikoff both determined that activated NK cells were the key to eliminating certain cancer cells and that NK cells require two signals to kill a tumor cell—a priming signal followed by a trigger signal. The “priming signal” can be provided by either cytokines, such as high dose IL-2 or IL-15 or possibly by administration of IRT-101. In contrast to IL-2 or IL-15, NK cells activated by IRT-101 ex vivo retain their activated state after cryopreservation and thawing. One of the most important features of IRT-101 therapy in cancer patients with advanced metastatic disease is the marked improvement in clinical benefit that has been observed in the Phase I/II clinical trials conducted to date. Clinical benefit is based upon parameters that reflect the overall wellbeing of the patient, including pain control, performance status, and body weight.
 
Clinical Trials
 
MENK has been safely used in several clinical studies to treat human subjects with cancer. Wybran and Schandené (1987) administered MENK intravenously to seven previously untreated patients with lung cancer and found significant increases in T-cell immunity. Plotnikoff, Wybran and colleagues have reported improvement in the size and coloration of Kaposi’s sarcoma nodules in AIDS patients. Phase I and Phase II studies have been conducted under IMUN’s IND (previously held by Penn State University) that have demonstrated that MENK can be delivered safely to patients suffering from advanced pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (PI: Eric Kimchi, M.D. at Penn State University) and advanced head and neck cancer (PI: David Goldenberg, M.D., FACS at Penn State University).

The maximum tolerated dose has been found to be 250 µg/kg using the intravenous route of administration over a 30-min infusion time in a Phase I trial in fourteen normal volunteers and eight cancer patients. This maximum tolerated dose was later confirmed in Phase I and Phase II trials in patients with advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer.
 
Patients with Kaposi’s sarcoma (9 patients), lung cancer (12 patients), melanoma (3 patients), hypernephroma (1 patient), or pancreatic cancer (1 patient) were treated with MENK for one week to 12 months at doses of 10 µg/kg three times per week up to 80 µg/kg 3 times per week. After 1-2 weeks increases in T cell subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD2 positive cells) were observed. An increase also occurred in IL-2 receptor expression. NK cell activity was measured in 14 patients and an increased NK activity was present in 12/14 patients. No toxicity attributable to treatment with MENK was observed in any patient.
 
Two case studies have been reported in an infant and a 20-month old child who were treated with MENK. The infant was diagnosed with hepatoblastoma and was treated with one course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy at approximately one week of age. Due to significant complications from the chemotherapy (neutropenic fever, pneumonia and sepsis), the patient’s parents declined further chemotherapy, and the infant was treated with surgical resection and MENK/LDN. She is currently close to ten years disease–free survival. The 20-month-old child was diagnosed with hepatoblastoma. Due to existing comorbidities (including autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease and hypertension), and biopsy results that indicated the tumor might be insensitive to chemotherapy, the parents elected not to proceed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The patient was treated with surgical resection and MENK/LDN, and is currently at more than five years disease-free survival.
 
Multiple clinical trials have been performed by Dr. Jill Smith and her colleagues at the Penn State University School of Medicine. A total of five advance cancer studies have been conducted with MENK via intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection. Three studies were conducted in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, one study in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and one study in patients with advanced head and neck cancer. Across the five studies, MENK therapy has been observed to be safe with limited toxicity when given to adults with advanced cancer. The patients with pancreatic cancer had failed prior chemotherapy regimens and were either treated with MENK or were entered into a hospice program. Clinical benefits were experienced by 53% of MENK-treated patients, whereas historical controls with similarly advanced disease had only 23.8% and 4.8% for gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), respectively. Of the MENK- treated patients surviving more than eight weeks, 62% showed either a decrease or stabilization in tumor size by computed tomography. The median survival time for the MENK-treated patients was three times that of the untreated hospice patients (65.5 versus 21 days, p < 0.001). No adverse effects on hematologic or chemistry parameters were noted, and quality of life surveys suggested improvement with MENK.
 
The use of MENK therapy at earlier stages of disease or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents may further improve the outcome of these and other very aggressive malignancies.
 
Our Clinical Trial Program for IRT-101/MENK
 
To date MENK has been administered in multiple indications including a range of cancers (including pancreatic, hepatocellular, and head and neck) and viral diseases, such as HIV/AIDS. When utilized for such indications, the typical dose administered to adults for efficacy while not compromising safety has been 150-250 µg/kg. Dosages up to 400 µg/kg have been used in other trials without toxicity in certain indications.

We will rely on available information and historical data to support the Phase II/III clinical trials and the ultimate filing of the NDA to the FDA. Clinical safety data has been established from multiple Phase I/II studies conducted under IMUN’s INDs and initial toxicology studies that have been completed.
 
To support the NDA filing, we plan to conduct the following studies:
 

● | Long-term toxicology studies in two species; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase I, PK assessment of MENK in healthy adult volunteers; 
● | Phase II, dose-response study in oncology patients; and 

 
Phase III, randomized, double-blind study in oncology patients is to be anticipated in Q2 2018 in Kenya and by Q4 of 2018 in the United States.
 
International Drug Development Plan 
 
Nigeria
 
The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary TNI BioTech International., completed a 90-day bridging trial for the treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS in Nigeria in 2017. The trial consisted of a total of one hundred and fifty patients of both genders between the ages of 18-60, each of whom was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The trial was undertaken at the State Specialist Hospital in Asubiaro, Osogbo, Osun State, Nigeria and the primary objective was to confirm that LodonalTM has a beneficial effect on the immune system of immune deficient patients and that it is safe. The trial separated the patients into a Control (placebo) Group and a Treatment Group (which was administered LodonalTM). The efficacy of increasing CD4 count [cell/mm3] between Day-1 and Day-90 by at least 25% was set as the criteria for demonstrating beneficial effect on the immune system. Safety was demonstrated through quality of life assessment and vitals both of which were not adversely affected. Treatment Group patients were given a daily dose of 4.5-mg/kg of Lodonal™.
 
The results yielded an average increase of 44% increase in CD4 count in the Lodonal Treatment Group compared to an 11% increase in the Control Group. Additionally, there were no reported opportunistic infections and no toxicity levels uncovered. Liver function remained normal and there was no negative impact on other systems based on blood results. No sleep disturbance or vivid dreams were present enough to justify trial discontinuation. No appreciable adverse CNS, renal, cardiac, hepatic, musculoskeletal, hematopoietic side effects were present.
 
In May 2017, the Company received approval from the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control of Nigeria (“NAFDAC”) to market and distribute LodonalTM in Nigeria. The approval is for a one-day Immune System Regulator for the management of HIV/AIDS
 
Malawi
 
The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary TNI BioTech International, received permission from the Pharmacy, Medicines and Poisons Board (PMPB) and The College of Medicine, University of Malawi to initiate a clinical trial for a Single Visit Approach to Cervical Cancer Prevention in the Republic of Malawi. The PMPB issued drug approval to import the drug in 2016 for the trial.
 
The Malawi Clinical Trial’s primary endpoint includes Safety, Acceptability, and Feasibility of a Single Visit Approach to Cervical Cancer Prevention in patients. (Trial number: VIA-LDN-401 -0 I). The secondary objective is to determine life extension; to improve the immune system of HIV and Cancer positive patients by starting treatment with LDN (“LodonalTM”) and to ensure marked improvement in Clinical benefit based upon parameters that reflect the overall well- being of the patient, including Pain control, performance status, and body weight under the supervision of Dr. Frank Taulo, Dr. Gladys Gadama, Dr. Effie Chipeta as Principal Investigators. The recruitment of study participants, testing and follow up is still on-going. The first evaluation report from the doctors involved is expected by the end of the second quarter as per the study protocol.

The Company intends to initiate a number of additional trials in Africa in the next 12 months, which will include trials as an adjunct to chemotherapy in Kenya and Ghana and HIV/AIDS in Malawi.
 
Competitive Advantage 
 
The Company believes many of the same advantages of our therapies apply to both the US market as well as the African market. LodonalTM could provide the first affordable, non-toxic approach for treatment of immune dysfunction, cancer and chronic inflammatory state.
 
Some of the Competitive Advantages and Benefits of LodonalTM include the following: 
 
Lower production costs and sales price of treatments
 
Today the majority of the drugs under development are both more expensive and more toxic. We do not believe this is the right way to move forward. Biologic agents cost between $12,000 and $150,000 a year.
 
LodonalTM/ IRT-103 can be manufactured and delivered in Emerging Nations for under $.90 cents a day and we estimate a price of $3,600 a year in developed country underwritten to $10 to $15 per month. When costs are not underwritten, the Company will provide LodonalTM to patients for $30 a month.
 
Lodonal™ should be able to substantially reduce health care costs for a number of reasons, including:
 

● | Lodonal™ can provide a new, non-toxic inexpensive method of medical treatment by mobilizing the natural defenses of one’s own immune system. It can be used as a stand-alone therapy or an adjunct to existing immunosuppressive therapies by reducing the toxic side effects of immunosuppressive drugs. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Lodonal™ does not require the medical supervision of antiretroviral or immunosuppressive therapies. 
● | Lodonal™ has not been found to have toxic side effects as it is an immunomodulator and activates and re-balances the immune system. 
● | Lodonal™ as an immunomodulator has a way of helping what is now referred to as “non-AIDS morbidity”, and, in the popular press, “premature aging”. 
● | Lodonal™ studies show that the drug enhances maturation of bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs). 
● | Lodonal™ studies show it does not compromise the immune system. 
● | Lodonal™ has been shown to reduce the number of opportunistic infections with HIV/AIDS. 
● | Lodonal™ may improve compliance. When used correctly, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is effective. However, according to recent studies, ART regimens require 70–90% adherence in order to be effective. Sustaining adherence to ART over the long term requires accurate and consistent monitoring, and this is a particular challenge for countries in sub-Saharan Africa. 

Recent Accomplishments
 
In May 2017, the Company received approval from the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control of Nigeria (“NAFDAC”) to market and distribute LodonalTM in Nigeria. The approval is for a one-day Immune System Regulator for the management of HIV/AIDS, which is based on the results of the Company’s 90-day bridging trial in Nigeria. The first shipments of product under this approval took place in February 2018.
 
In September 2017, the Company became registered under the U.S. Government’s System for Award Management to sell LodonalTM to Nigeria through the United States Agency for International Development (“USAID”) and UNAIDS. At the same time, the Company and AHAR filed for regulatory approval of the use of LodonalTM with the National Agency for the Control of AIDS in Nigeria (“NACA”). Once NACA approves the use of LodonalTM as a treatment for AIDS, it will be able to purchase LodonalTM directly from the Company and AHAR.
 
In addition to the work with NACA, USAID and UNAIDS, AHAR and the Company are moving forward with applications to NAFDAC to permit the sale of Lodonal™ in Nigeria for additional indications. We expect to submit those applications in the first quarter of 2018. Those indications include the use of the drug as an adjunct to treatment of chemotherapy, opportunistic infections and cancer.

In September of 2016, the Company retained the services of GLOBALMEDLINE SARL in Senegal to assist the drug registration of Lodonal™ in Senegal for HIV/AIDS and Cancer. The filing in Senegal is part of the Company’s program to register Lodonal™ throughout the francophone (French-speaking) countries in Africa using our approval in Senegal to fast track the process.
 
The Company is currently in the process of filing in Kenya, Ghana, Liberia, Mali, Senegal and Uganda. We expect to file in additional countries in 2018. The Company expects to have responses from regulatory authorities in Kenya by the end of the second quarter of 2018.
 
The Company has been assigned three provisional patent applications in the United States: No. 62/296,759, a Method for Inducing a Sustained Immune Response; No. 62/379,272, a Method for Treating and Preventing Protozoan Infection; and No. 62/450,635, Methods and Compositions Useful for Treating Cancer Application. The Company expects to file additional patent applications in the U.S. in the coming months. Our intellectual property portfolio includes biotech assets acquired either through acquisition or exclusive licensing. The Company converted the provisional patent for method for inducing immune response into a US patent, and a PCT application was filed on February 17, 2017 under number PCT/IB2017/000124.
 
The Company’s Board has authorized continued discussions with a number of potential partners in Far East as well as discussion with drug development partners in both the US and EU.
 
Patent License Agreements
 
On August 13, 2012, the Company signed an exclusive License Agreement with Ms. Jacqueline Young (the “Young Agreement”) for the intellectual property developed by Dr. Bernard Bihari relating to treatments with opioid antagonists such as naltrexone and Met-enkephalin for a variety of diseases and conditions including malignant lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, chronic herpes virus infections, chronic herpes viral infections such as chronic genital herpes caused by the herpes simplex virus Type 2 and chronic infections due to the Epstein-Barr virus and a treatment method for humans infected with HTLV-III (AIDS) virus, including patients clinically diagnosed as suffering from AIDS and those suffering from AIDS-related complex (ARC). The Bihari patents were acquired in exchange for 540,000 shares of the Company’s common stock with a fair value of $972,000 and assumed liabilities of $400,000, which was payable to Ms. Young over a twenty-four month period in equal installments to reimburse her for the costs of a New York City office in accordance with the Young Agreement. The cost of the patent totaled $1,372,000. Additionally, the Company will pay the licensor a royalty payment of 1% of gross sales. Due to the fact that there have been no sales of licensed product to date, the Company has been required, since the beginning of 2015, to make a minimum royalty payment of $100,000 annually to the licensor. The Young Agreement is valid for the life of the patents and expires on a country by country basis in each country where patent rights exist, upon the expiration of the last to expire patent in each country or in the event the patent in such country is held to be invalid and/or unenforceable (by a court or government body of competent jurisdiction) or admitted to be invalid or unenforceable. Additionally, the Company can cancel the Young Agreement upon 120 days’ written notice and shall pay all royalties and fees that have accrued under the Young Agreement. We have the exclusive rights to the intellectual property; however, Ms. Young retains a right to practice the patents licensed under the Young Agreement solely for noncommercial, academic research purposes.
 
The Young Agreement allows for the sub-license of the Bihari intellectual property from the Company to Cytocom. In accordance with the Agreement, In December 2014 the Company assigned the sub-license to Cytocom. In 2017, Ms. Young wrote to the Company alleging breach of the Young Agreement. The Company has responded denying any breach. Since inception of the Young Agreement, the Company has made payments to Ms. Young in excess of US$650,000, which it believes meets the requirements of the Young Agreement.
 
On December 24, 2012, the Company signed an agreement for the acquisition of patent rights (the “Smith Agreement”) for the intellectual property of Dr. Jill Smith and LDN Research Group, LLC (collectively, the “Licensor Parties”), whose members are Dr. Ian S. Zagon, Dr. Patricia J. McLaughlin and Moshe Rogosnitzky and orphan drug designation by the FDA to a novel late-stage drug, trademarked “LDN,” for the treatment of Pediatric Crohn’s disease. The patent covers methods and formulations for treatment of the inflammatory and ulcerative diseases of the bowel, using naltrexone in low doses as an opioid antagonist. These patents were acquired in exchange for 300,000 shares of our common stock with a fair value of $2,715,000 and payment of $165,384 (consisting of a $100,000 initial license fee and payment of $65,384 of expenses), which totaled $2,880,384.

Our common stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and we are required to file current, quarterly and annual reports and other information with the SEC. You may read and copy any document that we file at the SEC’s public reference facilities at 100 F. Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the SEC at 1-800-732-0330 for more information about its public reference facilities. Our SEC filings are available to you free of charge at the SEC’s web site at www.sec.gov. We are an electronic filer with the SEC and, as such, our information is available through the Internet site maintained by the SEC that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. This information may be found at www.sec.gov and posted on our website at www.immunetherapeutics.com.
Research and Development
 
Our research and development (“R&D”) organization focuses primarily on new uses for the opioid-related immuno-therapies, such as LDN and MENK. These therapies stimulate the immune system in such a way that provides the potential to treat a variety of diseases that have abnormalities in the immune system.
 
Our R&D priorities include development of MENK IRT-101, a small synthetic pentapeptide that is naturally occurring in the body, and LDN IRT-103, an opioid receptor antagonist. Our pipeline provides two therapies with an extremely wide range of indications that can be pursued. Both molecules have the ability to stimulate and/or regulate the immune system in order to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis, immune disorders such as Crohn’s disease, cancer, and viral infections such as HIV/AIDS.
 
Our R&D is overseen and managed internally, working with individuals, universities, and Contract Research Organizations (“CROs”) in order to utilize patents that we have licensed or acquired since our inception. We continue to seek to expand our pipeline by reviewing other compounds, technologies or capabilities. We also seek out promising compounds and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects.
 
Drug discovery and development is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable. According to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), out of 5,000-10,000 screened compounds, only 250 enter preclinical testing, five enter human clinical trials and one is approved by the FDA. The process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take more than 10 years. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research.
 

31 | P a g e
------------

 

As of December 31, 2015, we had two compounds (IRT-101 and IRT-103) in research and development. In 2015 our development programs focused on both compounds, one in oncology and one in Crohn’s disease; which we are expecting to move into Phase II clinical trials.
 
The following table provides information about notable regulatory actions by, and filings pending with the FDA and regulatory authorities in the EU, as well as additional indications and new drug candidates in late-stage development.
 

NEW DRUG CANDIDATES IN LATE-STAGE DEVELOPMENT 
-------------------------------------------------
CANDIDATE | INDICATION | REGULATORY ACTIONS 
IRT-101 | Pancreatic Cancer | End-of-Phase 1 Meeting with FDA Complete 3Q 2013 
IRT-103 | Crohn’s Disease | Type C Meeting with FDA Complete 2Q 2013 Scientific Advice with EMA Complete 1Q 2014 Type C meeting in January 2018 with the FDA to discuss clinical protocol design and to seek guidance for the clinical development program in the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with Crohn’s disease using a 505(b)(2) pathway to support an NDA. 

 
The Company expects it will incur future research and development expenditures in the next 12 months through Cytocom. Cytocom plans to conduct a Phase III trial for patients with Moderate to Severe Crohn’s Disease age 12 and over as an adjunct therapy to the standard of care and a phase IIb/III trial for Mild to Severe Crohn’s Disease in age 2 to 11. The cost of both trials would be $16,500,000. If the trials do not commence before the end of 2018, the Company will be required to make a payment of $100,000 in December 2018 under its license agreements. In prior years, the Company has been able to raise funds through sales of notes payable, and it expects to do the same for the payment due in 2018. With its own funding, Cytocom will be responsible for the development of IRT-101 MENK for pancreatic cancer.
 
Government Regulations
 
United States
 
The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries with regulations differing from country to country. Neither we nor our collaboration partners are permitted to market our drug candidates in the United States until we receive approval of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) from the FDA. Neither we nor our collaboration partners have submitted an application for or received marketing approval for any of our drug candidates. Obtaining approval of an NDA can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process.
 
Prior to receiving approval to commercialize any of our drug candidates in the United States or abroad, we and our collaboration partners must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory authorities abroad, that such drug candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Results from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Regulatory approval of an NDA or NDA supplement is not guaranteed, and the approval process is expensive and may take several years.
 
Before a drug can be tested in people, the sponsor (in this case the Company) performs laboratory and animal tests to discover how the drug works and whether it’s likely to be safe and effective in humans. As LDN and MENK have previously been used in clinical trials, this phase of development was not required by the Company to initiate clinical trials under its applications.
 
Next, a series of tests in people (i.e. clinical trials) is begun to determine whether the drug is safe when used to treat a disease and whether it provides a real health benefit. The clinical phase typically starts at Phase 1 and progresses to Phase 3. The Company will have an abbreviated list of clinical trials that need to be conducted due to published literature on previously conducted studies, as well as utilizing the approval of naltrexone previously at 50 mg by the FDA.
 

32 | P a g e
------------

 

Upon completion of the clinical trials, the Company will send the FDA and/or the EMA the evidence from these tests to prove the drug is safe and effective for its intended use (New Drug Application (NDA) in the US or Marketing Authorization Application in the EU). The regulatory bodies will review these data and determine if the sponsor has approval to market the product at the specified dose(s) and formulation(s) for the specified indication(s) (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/default.htm).
 
Once regulatory approval has been granted, the approved product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review by the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Any regulatory approval that we or our collaboration partners receive for our drug candidates may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing follow-up studies to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. In addition, if the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities approve any of our drug candidates, we will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements by the FDA and other regulatory authorities with regard to the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for our products. In addition, manufacturers of our drug products are required to comply with current cGMP regulations which include requirements related to quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Further, regulatory authorities must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our drug products, and these facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations.
 
European Union
 
We intend to seek distribution and marketing partners for IRT-101 (MENK) and IRT-103 (LDN) in the European Union (“EU”). To market our future products in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) (which is comprised of the 27 member states of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”).

● | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a member state of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another member state through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the Decentralized Procedure. 

 
Under the procedures described above, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 
Our IND is being conducted per 21 Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, Part 312. In addition, we follow ICH guidelines, including good clinical practices (ICH E6) and current good manufacturing practice (ICH Q7) throughout the development process. After completion of Phase III clinical trials, the Company will file our NDA for LDN (IRT-103) as a 505(b)(2) application. IRT-103 products will follow the 505(b)(2) pathway relying on the Reference Listed Drug (RLD) REVIA to support the safety of the product. Efficacy will be submitted by the Company directly to the LDN NDA. IRT-101 products will follow the traditional approval pathway as a Reference Listed Drug (“RLD”, a drug used to compare effects and safety with FDA trial drug) is not available for MENK. However, published literature will support this program.

Nigeria 
 
NAFDAC is the equivalent in Nigeria of the FDA. It undertakes registration of food, drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, agrochemicals and other similar products in Nigeria. At the end of the process, a registration number is given to the product and a registration certificate is issued to the applicant.
 
In May 2017, the Company received approval from NAFDAC to market and distribute LodonalTM in Nigeria. The approval is for a one-day Immune System Regulator for the management of HIV/AIDS, which is based on the results of the Company’s 90-day bridging trial in Nigeria.
 
Many of the African countries do not have a local FDA equivalent organization or agency. We plan to use the NAFDAC Registration as the guideline for submission in Africa for countries that do not have their own application and approval procedures.
 
Malawi
 
No formal governmental agency is in place in Malawi to govern the application of a new drug. Malawi is a member of the Southern Africa Development Community (“SADC”). The SADC has been making efforts to synchronize the regulation of medication in the SADC countries.
 
The guidelines require filing an application prior to approval of registration. However, these guidelines are preliminary. The Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (“RISDP”) is a comprehensive development and implementation framework guiding the Regional Integration agenda of the SADC over a period of fifteen years (2005-2020). It is designed to provide clear strategic direction with respect to SADC programs, projects and activities in line with the SADC Common Agenda and strategic priorities, as enshrined in the SADC Treaty of 1992.
 
In July 2014, the Republic of Malawi approved Lodonal™ as an adjunct for the treatment of cancer. Protocols for a Lodonal™ trial were approved in November 2015. The Brewer Group, Inc. paid for production of the first shipment to Malawi of Lodonal™ in 2015.
 
The Company and the Brewer Foundation arranged for the donation of the Wallach LL100 Cryosurgical system that were necessary to run the trial and treat patients with cervical cancer. In July 2014, the Republic of Malawi approved Lodonal™ as an adjunct for the treatment of cancer. Protocols for a Lodonal™ trial were approved in November 2015.
 
In 2012, the Company started its collaboration with the Brewer Foundation and the Brewer Group. Over the last two years, The Brewer Group and Foundation has worked directly with the Government of Malawi on the approval of the clinical trials and protocols. Once the protocols were approved the Brewer Group help to arrange funding for the trials.
 
The Brewer Group has entered into a distribution agreement with Airmed Bioparhma Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, to distribute Lodonal™ in emerging markets. The distribution agreement was entered into in 2014 and has a term of 5 years. Pursuant to the distribution agreement the Company shall sell Lodonal™ to The Brewer Group at a 25% discount to the list price. The Brewer Group has also arranged a number of meetings with various hedge funds in New York to assist with the funding of the company.
 
The Company’s relationships with the Brewer Group and Brewer Foundation are contractual, with the rights and obligations of the parties dictated by their respective agreements. The Brewer Group, Brewer Foundation and certain of their affiliates may also now own, or in the past owned, minority share positions in the Company via their investments or shares granted for services.

China
 
On October 18, 2012, the Company and Hubei Qianjiang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Qianjiang Pharmaceutical”), signed a Venture Cooperation Agreement on New Drug Methionine Enkephalin (the “Venture Agreement”) pursuant to which Qianjiang Pharmaceutical acquired an exclusive license for the production of MENK in China. The Venture Agreement requires that Qianjiang Pharmaceutical conduct drug research and pilot testing for MENK, organize pre-clinical studies, and apply for clinical trials for MENK with the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration. Under the Venture Agreement, Qianjiang Pharmaceutical must open a co-administration account for the development of MENK in China. Qianjiang Pharmaceutical must pay the Company, upon the marketing of MENK products, a half-year amount equaling 6% of its gross sales from MENK of the preceding half year.
 
Qianjiang Pharmaceutical is required to obtain all approvals and permits required for the importation and sale of the Company’s products in China.
 
The Company may cancel the Venture Agreement if Qianjiang Pharmaceutical does not pay expenses for a period exceeding nine months or does not commence clinical trials within 12-months after receiving certain approvals. Qianjiang Pharmaceutical may cancel the Venture Agreement if the Company fails to perform its obligations for a period of nine months or the failure to receive approval of clinical trials is due to the Company’s MENK technologies.
 
On August 6, 2014, the Company entered into a Supplementary Agreement on New Drug Methionine – Enkephalin Cooperation (the “Amendment”) with Qianjiang Pharmaceutical, amending the Venture Agreement, as amended. The Company and Qianjiang Pharmaceutical executed the Amendment to accelerate clinical trials in both the United States and China, and agreed to immediately initiate three month Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) Toxicology Studies (rat and dog) within 30 days of signing the Amendment. The Amendment requires that the GLP Toxicology Studies Trials are conducted in China in accordance with international standards and standards acceptable to the FDA.
 
The Company modified the agreement one more time due to the fact toxicology studies were not completed by the end of 2015 as others steps were required before the studies could start.
 
Qianjiang has completed the formulation and required Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (“CMC”) for Methionine–Enkephalin. All work was completed in China in accordance with international cGMP standards acceptable to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration with Chinese Peptide Company (“CPC”). CPC is among only a handful of companies in the world that can claim both ISO Certification and cGMP licensing. In February 2012, we became the first peptide company to successfully pass US FDA inspection outside of US and Europe regions.
 
Dominican Republic
 
In October 2016, the Company and Acromax Dominicana, SA (“Acromax”) entered into a contract for the manufacture of LDN tablets, capsules and/or creams (“Agreement”). Acromax is located in Santo Domingo; in the Dominican Republic. It is both cGMP certified and ISO 9001: 2008 certified. Acromax exports over 160 products and has sold throughout the Caribbean and Central and South America. More information about Acromax is available at http://acromaxdominicana.com/.
 
The Agreement has an initial term of five years unless terminated by either party in accordance with the terms. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Acromax will obtain all necessary licenses and permits to carry out the manufacturing and packaging of LDN in exchange for a fixed fee per tablet plus an additional fee for packaging, shipping and customs clearance. In 2017, Acromax received approval from the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance to manufacture and sell Naltrexone both in the Dominican Republic as well as for export on behalf of TNI BioTech International under the trademark name Lodonal™. The company was granted and issued a Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (“COPP”) for the following countries: Nigeria, Senegal, Kenya and Malawi. We expect to add additional countries to the COPP in 2017.
 
In January of 2017, Acromax obtained from the Dominican Republic Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance and Medications a Specialized Pharmaceuticals Registration Certification for LodonalTM, which allows for the manufacture and sale of LodonalTM in the Dominican Republic and for export. The Ministry also issued a Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product for Nigeria, Kenya, Senegal and Malawi, which will allow for the export of LodonalTM to those countries where we have drug and marketing approval.

Business Strategy
 
The Company’s short-term business strategy focuses on several key areas described below, all of which are being undertaken simultaneously.
 
International Regulatory Approval in 2017: The Company has been in discussions with drug regulators regarding the regulatory and approvals process for sale of its products in 2017 in a number of countries: South Africa, Nigeria, Malawi, Kenya, Angola, Niger, Gabon, Egypt, Sri Lanka, and China. The process can take between four to 12 months depending on the local authorities. In May 2017, the Company received approval from the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control of Nigeria (“NAFDAC”) to market and distribute LodonalTM in Nigeria. The approval is for a one-day Immune System Regulator for the management of HIV/AIDS, which is based on the results of the Company’s 90-day bridging trial in Nigeria.
 
In 2017, using the results from the trial in Nigeria, the Company applied to the Kenyan Pharmacy and Poisons Board for approval to distribute Lodonal in Kenya. The Company is currently completing the submission of the trial data in Kenya, and expects to receive approvals to distribute the product by the end of the second quarter of 2018.
 
While working on regulatory approval throughout Africa, The Company has begun discussions with a number of international organizations including the World Health Organization, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and PATH, an international nonprofit organization dedicated to saving lives and improving health, especially among women and children. The Company expects to reach agreements with them in the coming year.
 
Establish Partnerships in Africa: Receipt of the recent approvals in Nigeria will allow the Company to establish partnerships in Africa with large employers that maintain onsite clinics; there is increasing recognition that health creates wealth and advances GDP. HIV and AIDS have had a significant negative impact on labor and productivity. The vast majority of people living with HIV in Africa are of working age 15-49 years old. The Company believes that Lodonal™ can be used as a prophylactic to avoid many of the standard opportunistic infections accompanied with HIV and cancer. The Company will now move forward on this program if it receives approval for Lodonal™ sales in Nigeria.
 
Funding Cytocom Inc. Clinical Trials: As of the date of filing of this Form 10-K, there is no formal agreement in place between the Company and Cytocom for the Company to fund research and development to be undertaken by Cytocom. Cytocom is currently pursuing its own initiatives to raise funds to support its R&D initiatives in the U.S. If the Company generates significant revenue from sales to Africa, and if Cytocom is not successful in raising its own funding, we believe that in 2018 we will be able to enter into a formal arrangement to commit financial resources to help fund Cytocom’s clinical trials in the United States and Europe to validate the use of Lodonal LDN in a number of indications.
 
Clinical Studies:
 
In 2017, the Company focused on receipt of approvals in Nigeria to conduct clinical development programs for Lodonal™. We completed a trial in Nigeria in December 2017, and in December 2017 we received final NAFDAC approval to commence sales in Nigeria. The first shipments took place in February 2018.
 
The Company also expects to complete a bridging trial for cancer in 2018 in the Republic of Malawi for Lodonal™ as a stand-along therapy. The recruitment of study participants, VIA testing and follow up of patients is still on-going. The first evaluation report from the doctors involved is expected by the end of June 2018 as per the study protocol. Since we have a cancer trial with Lodonal as an adjunct, we decided to hold off requesting final approval for the second trial until we complete our first trial, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2018.
 

36 | P a g e
------------

 

On the regulatory front, Cytocom has held constructive dialogue with the FDA with respect to appropriate trial designs and study protocols for Lodonal™ for Crohn’s Disease. According to minutes from a Type C meeting held on January 16, 2018, the Company, on behalf of Cytocom, and the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) met to discuss next steps in the development of Lodonal™ as an adjunct therapy to the standard of care for moderate to severe Crohn’s disease in patients age 12 and over and mild to severe Crohn’s in pediatric patients aged 2 to 11. Cytocom will move forward with its IND 067442 submission for the Phase 3 pivotal clinical program for moderate to severe Crohn’s disease in patients 12 and over and will file for a New Drug Application for its pediatric trial. Subject to the availability of funding, the Company expects to start recruitment for this Phase 3 trial before the end of 2018.
 
In addition to the trial design as described immediately above, the Company intends to undertake a Toxicologist and PK study in China with its partner, Hubei Qianjiang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, for IRT-101 for the purpose of furthering its understanding of the effect of the pharmacokinetics of IRT-101. The trial has been delayed until 2018 because the State Food and Drug Administration of the People’s Republic of China on the Safety of Drugs and Medical Devices (SFDA) has required chemistry, manufacturing and controls to be completed before the start of the toxicology study. Quinjiang expects to have the PK and Toxicology studies completed before the end of the year. This will allow the Company to better understand the potential for drug interactions to further optimize treatment for Phase 3 development of IRT-101 for cancer in both the United States and China. These trials are required before Hubei can file for a phase III trial for liver cancer with the SFDA
 
The Company recently received the pharmacology and toxicology reports for MENK completed at GLP Lab by Hubei Qianjiang on. In addition to the pharmacology and toxicology, China Peptide Company has completed the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) required to file with both the SFDA and the FDA, as no pivotal trial can be started without CMC.
 
Strategy for Growth:
 
Since 2015, the Company has worked aggressively to build the business both upward and outward. It has worked to create a multi-faceted leader in immunotherapies by exploring opportunities beyond HIV/AIDS and cancer in emerging nations.
 
The goal and strategic vision is to build a diverse pipeline and to develop and commercialize novel drug treatments to improve the lives of patients suffering from chronic often life-threating disease.
 
To fulfill these goals, the Company has received funding from the sale of stock, the exercise of stock warrants and issuance of notes payable totaling approximately $2 million in 2017. The Company anticipates generating revenues in 2018 from a number of sources, including revenues from the use of its formulation and patents and the sale of Lodonal™ in Nigeria and Kenya.
 
Company Growth:
 
To build visibility and positive awareness of the Company, management has made presentations at key investor and industry conferences internationally.
 
The Company believes it will be able to use approvals for the sale of LDN in Nigeria to “fast track” the approval process in a number of African nations that will accept NAFDAC Nigeria’s approval of Lodonal™ for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.
 
Focus on HIV/AIDS
 
HIV/AIDS remains one of the three global public health threats. This disease results in substantial morbidity, mortality, negative socioeconomic consequences, and human suffering. Despite the significant increase in financial support and recent progress in addressing HIV/AIDS, many obstacles and unmet priorities remain.
 

37 | P a g e
------------

 

Disease-specific interventions must be developed to ensure successful treatments of this disease. Apart from human suffering, the associated high adult mortality caused by HIV/AIDS, negatively impacts the socioeconomic development in some countries, especially in Nigeria and South Africa.
 
Adopting a treatment regimen for life that involves taking daily medication with potential side effects, presents many challenges that must be overcome if patients are to successfully remain on treatment. If drug resistance occurs through failure to adhere to antiretroviral treatments (“ARVs”), far more expensive second line therapy may be necessary. In some cases drug-resistant strains of HIV are transmitted, which can impact national treatment programs. Drug resistance has been found to be more prevalent the longer a country has provided antiretroviral therapies.
 
The Company believes Lodonal™ can provide an alternative in areas where patients have stopped taking their therapies due to side effects, or cost; Lodonal™ has been shown in trials to lessen the toxic side effects of ARVs. In those countries where people must travel monthly for a medical check-up (and lose a day’s pay), Lodonal™ can cost-effectively provide the ability to slow the progression of the disease without any toxic side effects.
 
Nigeria: In Nigeria, it is estimated that more than 3.6 million people are living with HIV/AIDS, with the annual number of new infections for adults at 323,000 and 57,000 for children. Currently, only 600,000 people receive HIV treatment (see http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/).
 
South Africa: Based on a wide range of data including the household and antenatal studies, UNAIDS (see http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries) estimated that HIV prevalence was 17.3% among 15-49 year olds at the end of 2011. The high and low estimates were 16.6% and 18.1%, respectively. This implies that approximately 5.6 million South Africans were living with HIV at the end of 2011, including 460,000 children under 15 years old. By October 2012, only two million people were receiving ARVs. The biggest problem is compliance with prescribed treatment, as people are required to take pills 2 to 3 times a day at specific times and many times with food with considerable toxic side effects. In contrast, Lodonal™ is taken only once per day, does not have to be taken with food, and has no toxic side effects.
 
Agreements to Promote Development and Sale of Company Products
 
The Company is focused on its lead therapies designed for the treatment of cancer, HIV/AIDS, Crohn’s disease, fibromyalgia and MS. Management believes the pharmaceutical industry is eager to acquire advanced clinical-phase and approved products. However, despite the strong demand for advanced clinical-phase products, nearly 4,000 known compounds have had their development suspended in Phase II or earlier. Many of these are promising therapeutic drug candidates, but their development was discontinued because of strategic or financial constraints rather than for clinical reasons. Therefore, management believes there are clear market opportunities with a significant amount of unmet needs and a robust potential for partnering activities.
 
To further the business strategy, the Company has entered into relationships with a number of groups to promote the sale of its products outside the U.S., focusing initially on countries in Africa. They include: The Brewer Group, Inc.; GB Oncology & Imaging Group, LLC; American Hospitals and Resorts Limited (“AHAR”), an advanced surgical and medical facility, as well as a number of U.S. doctors that own and operate clinics in the U.S. and Nigeria.
 
The Brewer Group, Inc. is an international business advisory firm engaged in the business of identifying and capitalizing on opportunities with international governments, non-government organizations and professional athletes. The CEO of The Brewer Group is also the founder and Executive Director of The Jack Brewer Foundation. The Jack Brewer Foundation seeks to provide the Company with medical equipment where it is needed. Under the Engagement Agreement for Corporate Advisory Services dated February 5, 2013, the Brewer Group agreed to evaluate the Company’s options for expansion and growth into certain international markets, including Africa and, upon request, markets in Haiti, the Dominican Republic and/or Panama. Pursuant to the Engagement Agreement, the Brewer Group agreed to endorse the Company publicly and assist the Company in securing strategic partnership deals to enhance brand and market awareness. The initial term of the Engagement Agreement was 12 months, with an option for either party to terminate upon 30 calendar days with written notice to the other party. The agreement has been extended through 2017.

Since the receipt of NAFDAC approval to sell LodonalTM in Nigeria, AHAR and the Company have held discussions to commence distribution of Lodonal under their agreement. The Company has received an initial order for 400,000 capsules over a 12-month period in equal quarterly instalments. The first order was shipped in February 2018. AHAR has opened discussions with a small number of wholesalers in Nigeria for the purchase of LodonalTM.
 
On August 22, 2017, the Company entered into a Distribution Agreement with TNI BioTech International Ltd. (“TNI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary, and Omaera Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (“Omaera”). Pursuant to the Agreement, Omaera will be the sole distributor of the Company’s Products, as listed in Section 2 of the Agreement, for sale in Kenya. The Products to be distributed by Omaera will be manufactured by Acromax Dominicana, SA. The term of the Agreement began on August 22, 2017 and is to continue for a period of three (3) years, unless earlier terminated.
 
On October 18, 2012, the Company and Hubei Qianjiang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Qianjiang Pharmaceutical”), signed a Venture Cooperation Agreement on New Drug Methionine Enkephalin (the “Venture Agreement”) pursuant to which Qianjiang Pharmaceutical acquired an exclusive license for the production of MENK in China. The Venture Agreement requires that Qianjiang Pharmaceutical conduct drug research and pilot testing for MENK, organize pre-clinical studies, and apply for clinical trials for MENK with the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration. Under the Venture Agreement, Qianjiang Pharmaceutical must open a co-administration account for the development of MENK in China. Qianjiang Pharmaceutical must pay the Company, upon the marketing of MENK products, a half-year amount equaling 6% of its gross sales from MENK of the preceding half year. The Company may cancel the Venture Agreement if Qianjiang Pharmaceutical does not pay expenses for a period exceeding nine months or does not commence clinical trials within 12-months after receiving certain approvals. Qianjiang Pharmaceutical may cancel the Venture Agreement if the Company fails to perform its obligations for a period of nine months or the failure to receive approval of clinical trials is due to the Company’s MENK technologies. The Venture Agreement was amended on February 24, 2013 to expand the clinical trials from pancreatic to both pancreatic and liver cancer and amended on March 6, 2014 to require Qianjiang Pharmaceutical to commence studies and clinical trials in China and place funds in the co-administration account.
 
On August 6, 2014, the Company entered into a Supplementary Agreement on New Drug Methionine – Enkephalin Cooperation (the “Amendment”) with Qianjiang Pharmaceutical, amending the Venture Agreement, as amended. The Company and Qianjiang Pharmaceutical executed the Amendment to accelerate clinical trials in both the United States and China, and agreed to immediately initiate three month Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) Toxicology Studies (rat and dog) within 30 days of signing the Amendment. The Amendment requires that the GLP Toxicology Studies Trials are conducted in China in accordance with international standards and standards acceptable to the FDA.
 
In February 2013, the Company signed a Strategic Framework Agreement for Cooperation with Qianjiang Pharmaceutical. Under the agreement, the parties will work together to further the development of new products and conduct research and development on the Company’s licensed patented technology. Specifically, the parties aim to co-invest to develop and market products focusing on HIV, cancer and related autoimmune system therapies, develop co-ventured manufacturing facilities in China, and develop co-ventured distribution of the developed products in China and Africa. The agreement does not have a definitive term, as each new agreement resulting from the cooperation will set forth the material terms, including, but not limited to, fees, duration and termination therein.
 
In accordance with these agreements, Qianjiang Pharmaceutical has acquired MENK material for the preclinical and clinical trial. MENK toxicology studies are in process under the trial, including a six-month toxicology study in animals. Other studies, including stability and general pharmacology (on normal animals to determine the effect to heart, blood pressure, etc.) have commenced. All FDA-required tests, including formulation and quality control tests, are in process in China.
 
The Company recently received the pharmacology and toxicology reports for MENK at GLP lab completed by Hubei Qianjiang. In addition to the pharmacology and toxicology, China Peptide has completed the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) required to file with both the SFDA and the FDA, as no pivotal trial can be started without CMC.

In January 2017, Acromax obtained from the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance a Medications and Specialized Pharmaceuticals Registration Certification for LodonalTM, which allows for the manufacture and sale of LodonalTM in the Dominican Republic and for export. The Ministry also issued a Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product for Nigeria, Kenya, Senegal and Malawi, which will allow for the export of LodonalTM to those countries where the Company has drug and marketing approval.
 
In February 2018, the Company shipped the first Lodonal products made by Acromax to Nigeria.
 
The Company has contracted with QS Pharma, located in Boothwyn, PA, to formulate Low Dose Immediate Release in 1mg, 1.5mg, 3mg and 4.5mg and liquid for pediatric purposes in the USA. QS Pharma’s facility consists of over 43,000 sq. ft. of Analytical Laboratories and Drug Product Manufacturing space available which include cGMP suites and non-GMP development laboratories. There are 14 manufacturing suites with dedicated Air and HVAC systems and the suites and equipment can accommodate batch sizes ranging from <1kg to over 500kg. Cytocom will assume all rights and obligations under the contract.
 
Immune has also contracted with Complete Pharmacy & Medical Solutions, LLC (“Complete Pharmacy”), located in Miami Lakes, FL., to manufacture Lodonal for all clinical trials initiated by Cytocom. Complete Pharmacy is registered with the FDA as a 503B outsourcing facility under the Drug Quality and Security Act. A 503B outsourcing facility must report specific information about the products that it compounds, including a list of all of the products it has compounded during the previous six months, and information about the compounded products, such as the source of the ingredients used to compound (section 503B(3)). In addition, the outsourcing facility must meet other conditions described in the law, including reporting adverse events and labeling its compounded products with certain information (section 503B(b)(5) and section 503B(a)(10)). The facility specializes in the manufacture of sterile and non-sterile prescription drugs. Complete Pharmacy offers high quality, custom or statutory formulations for hospital and clinical operations.
 
Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers
 
The Company has decided to enter into third-party manufacturing agreements; accordingly, we rely on third parties for clinical production of our products and product candidates.
 
The active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) for initiating clinical trials in the United States has been and will continue to be sourced from a cGMP-established vendor that has filed or will file a Type II Drug Master File in the United States. Prior to sourcing, a quality due diligence/vendor qualification will be completed that will include, but is not limited to, a review of the vendor’s inspection and compliance history with the FDA and, as relevant, the vendor’s inspection and compliance history with other regulatory bodies (i.e. the European Medicines Agency, or EMA).
 
The Company expects that the Finished Pharmaceutical Product (“FPP”) for initiating the proposed clinical trials will be prepared by a U.S. vendor with extensive cGMP experience, a strong record of compliance with FDA regulations as evidenced by a site Quality Audit, and an extensive history of manufacturing products administered to humans in the U.S.
 
American Peptide Company is the Company’s supplier of the API in MENK. S.A.L.A.R.S SpA supplies the API in LDN.

Competition
 
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, reliability, and price and reimbursement level.
 
Many of our potential competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Further, the development of new treatment methods for the conditions we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
 
Lodonal™/LDN
 
The key competitive factors affecting the success of Lodonal™, if approved, are likely to be efficacy, safety, tolerability, frequency and route administration, convenience and price, the level of branded and generic competition and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 
The markets for medicines to treat Crohn’s disease, fibromyalgia, MS, HIV and other autoimmune diseases are well developed and populated with established drugs marketed by large and small pharmaceutical, biotechnology and generic drug companies. Pfizer (Lyrica), Eli Lilly (Cymbalta) and Forest Laboratories/Cyprus Biosciences (Savella) market FDA approved drugs for fibromyalgia. We are aware of several companies pursuing treatments for fibromyalgia, including Chelsea Therapeutics, Johnson and Johnson, Meda, Pfizer, Synthetic Biologics, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and Theravance. Clinical trials in the U.S. are registered with the FDA and reported on the FDA’s website at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
 
Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in cancer research, some in direct competition with us. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 
We expect Lodonal™, if approved for the treatment of Crohn’s disease, to compete directly with Centocor Ortho Biotech Inc.’s Remicade (infliximab), UCB S.A.’s Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) and Abbott Laboratories’ Humira (adalimumab), each of which is currently approved for the treatment of various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, and several other products. Lodonal, if developed and approved for the treatment of MS, would compete with Biogen Idec’s Avonex (interferon beta-1a), Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals’ Betaseron (interferon beta-1b) and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd.’s Copaxone (Glatiramer Acetate) and several other products. New developments, including the development of other pharmaceutical technologies and methods of treating disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries at a rapid pace.

IRT-101/MENK
 
The key competitive factors affecting the success of IRT-101, if approved, are likely to be efficacy, safety, tolerability, frequency and route administration, convenience and price, the level of branded and generic competition and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 
Each cancer indication for which we are developing products has a number of established therapies with which our candidates will compete. Most major pharmaceutical companies and many biotechnology companies are aggressively pursuing new cancer development programs, including both therapies with traditional, as well as novel, mechanisms of action. Some of the anticipated competitor treatments for acute myelogenous leukemia include Genzyme Corporation’s Clolar (clofarabine), currently approved as a treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Eisai Corporation’s Dacogen (decitabine), currently approved as a treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome, Celgene Corporation’s Vidaza (azacitidine), currently approved as a treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome, and Vion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s Onrigin (laromustine) currently being developed as a treatment for acute myelogenous leukemia, any or all of which could change the treatment paradigm of acute leukemia. Each of these compounds is further along in clinical development than is IRT-101 activated NK cell product.
 
Customers
 
In 2017, there were no product sales to customers. In 2016, the Company recorded Lodonal™ sales totaling $3,463 to individuals in the USA.
 
In 2018, the Company commenced shipment of LodonalTM tablets to Nigeria under its agreement with AHAR.
 
The Company expects to commence deliveries to Kenya under its agreement with Omaera in 2018.
