Item 1. BUSINESS 
Overview
We are a leader in the design, development, and marketing of advanced high-speed wireless communication solutions enabling wireless local area networking. Our solutions are designed to deliver leading-edge Wi-Fi performance to support an increasing number of connected devices accessing a rapidly growing pool of digital content. We apply our wireless systems and software expertise with high-performance radio frequency, mixed-signal and digital semiconductor design skills to provide highly integrated Wi-Fi solutions to our customers. Our technical expertise and focus on innovation enable us to address the increasing complexity inherent in managing Wi-Fi network access for multiple client devices with different high-bandwidth content streams, while simultaneously delivering superior network speed, broad coverage area, and high capacity and reliability. Our innovative solutions have historically addressed the communications service provider, or service provider, market for home networking applications, including home gateways, repeaters, mesh nodes and video clients such as set-top boxes, or STBs, but we are seeking to increasingly address additional end markets, with solutions for retail, outdoor, small and medium business, enterprise, industrial and consumer electronics. As a pioneer in high performance Wi-Fi solutions, we believe that we are well positioned to serve the rapidly evolving Wi-Fi needs of customers in both our existing and future end markets. We also believe our significant engineering expertise in wireless and communications can expand our addressable market beyond Wi-Fi.
Wi-Fi is a ubiquitous standard for wireless network connectivity, defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, or IEEE, 802.11 standardization body working group that is rapidly evolving to deliver continued performance improvements while maintaining backward compatibility. According to ABI Research, in 2018 approximately 2.9 billion Wi-Fi-enabled devices are expected to ship, of which approximately 0.8 billion were non-portable devices, and cumulatively, over 18 billion Wi-Fi-connected devices are expected to ship worldwide as of the end of 2018. The rapid growth in Wi-Fi connected devices, coupled with the steadily rising volume of global Internet Protocol-based, or IP-based, traffic, such as web browsing, email, Internet audio and video, file sharing, cloud computing and online gaming, has significantly increased the performance requirements of access points that power Wi-Fi networks. The Cisco Visual Networking Index forecasts that monthly worldwide IP traffic over Wi-Fi will grow from 54 exabytes per month in 2017 to 202 exabytes per month in 2022, a compound annual growth rate of 30%. Such requirements have led to the adoption of ever faster and higher performing Wi-Fi with every standard iteration. 
The current generation of Wi-Fi standard is 802.11ac, which experienced its initial adoption in 2013. Due to its higher order modulation and spatial streams, which increased to eight compared to four in the prior generation, as well as its introduction of multi-user, multiple input and multiple output (MU-MIMO), the 802.11ac standard provided an opportunity for us to differentiate our solution from our competitors and gain market share by meeting the full performance and standard requirements. The next Wi-Fi standard is 802.11ax, designated as “Wi-Fi 6” by the Wi-Fi Alliance in October 2018, is currently in draft form and anticipated to be ratified in late 2019. Wi-Fi 6 is the latest revision of the 802.11 Wi-Fi standard, which offers improvement in network speeds over its predecessor and accommodates more users and client nodes. Wi-Fi 6 makes use of orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA), which allows better multiplexing of various users. We believe once again that our solutions meet the Wi-Fi 6 standard and will differentiate us from our competitors and give us more opportunities to gain market share. Given the limited wireless spectrum available for Wi-Fi networks and the rapidly increasing demand for Wi-Fi-enabled services, the IEEE standardization body continues to define more advanced capabilities for future revisions of the standard, in particular a new standard to be based on the EHT (extremely high throughput) study group which seeks to advance 802.11 technology to the 6 gigahertz, or GHz, unlicensed bands, which offers more than twice the total spectrum the current 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi unlicensed bands. The 802.11 standard implementation is left to the chipset vendors, and the inherent complexity and many optional features of the standard result in trade-offs leading to wide-ranging levels of Wi-Fi chipset functionality, performance, power and cost.
As the performance requirements of next generation Wi-Fi increase, a more advanced approach to the design of high-speed wireless communication products is required to address numerous challenges such as increasing Wi-Fi speeds, spectrum sharing, competing traffic, evolving standards, legacy Wi-Fi processing architecture and network interferences. We have pioneered significant enhancements to advanced features such as higher-order Multiple Input and Multiple Output, or MIMO, Multi-User MIMO, or MU-MIMO, transmit beamforming, and additional technologies to achieve superior Wi-Fi performance relative to our competition. Our competitive strengths include support of the most advanced specifications, proprietary technology 
- 1 -

architectures, and advanced software and system-level algorithms. Furthermore, we have created a series of software products and tools that augment our silicon solutions. These include: ViSiON, a cloud-based Wi-Fi analytics and monitoring platform that remotely diagnoses network inefficiencies; SONiQ, intelligent self-optimizing network software for seamless mesh connectivity between multiple repeaters and multi-access points; and Qdock, a software layer that resides on all of our silicon solutions, enabling an interface for third-party developers and partners to develop new features on our Wi-Fi ecosystem.
Customers choose our Wi-Fi solutions to offer products with differentiated network speed, coverage area, reliability, and capacity. Our solutions portfolio is currently comprised of multiple generations of our radio frequency chip and our digital baseband chip, which together support the IEEE Wi-Fi standards, including 802.11n, 802.11ac and the draft Wi-Fi 6 standard. Radio frequency chips use a combination of analog, digital and high frequency circuits to transmit and receive signals in certain frequencies, such as 2.4 gigahertz and 5GHz for Wi-Fi. Digital baseband chips transmit and receive data to and from radio frequency chips. These chips are typically sold together as a chipset combined with software and system-level reference designs that constitute a highly integrated Wi-Fi solution. We maintain our product differentiation by designing and implementing a variety of innovative system architecture features, as well as advanced software and system-level algorithms.
According to ABI Research, the global market for Wi-Fi chipsets is expected to grow from $4.0 billion in 2017 to $5.5 billion in 2022. We have shipped over 200 million chips to our customers across four semiconductor process generations. Our chips consist of transistors using various advanced semiconductor fabrication technology nodes, which are measured in nanometers, or nm, to address different system requirements. We are currently in volume production in 90nm, 65nm, 40nm and 28nm. During the year ended December 30, 2018, our global original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, and original design manufacturer, or ODM, customers included Arris International plc, or Arris, Foxconn Technology Group or Foxconn, Mitrastar Technology Corp. or Mitrastar, Sagemcom Broadband SAS, or Sagemcom, and Technicolor SA, or Technicolor. During the same period, these OEM and ODM customers supported a number of major service providers in the United States as well as internationally. For the year ended December 30, 2018, our revenue was $220.5 million and our net income was $3.1 million, and we had an accumulated deficit of $124.1 million as of December 30, 2018. 
Industry Background 
Global growth in IP data traffic and the proliferation of Wi-Fi connected devices are driving demand for increased and higher performance Wi-Fi connectivity. In addition, the types of IP traffic carried over Wi-Fi are also expanding. When Wi-Fi was first introduced into homes and enterprises, the predominant applications were email and Internet access. Today, the number of applications supported over Wi-Fi has grown to also encompass voice over IP, high-definition audio, Ultra High Definition television, or UHD, TV, cloud computing, gaming and over-the-top video, which refers to the delivery of video over the subscriber’s broadband connection without the involvement of traditional TV service providers. We believe that Wi-Fi will become the most prevalent method to carry these applications. 
To meet these demands, service providers, retail OEMs, enterprise OEMs, and consumer electronics OEMs are increasingly focused on integrating the best Wi-Fi capabilities into their products. 

• | Service Providers. Service providers, including AT&T, Inc., or AT&T, Comcast Corporation, or Comcast, Cox Communications, Orange S.A., and Telefonica, S.A., are seeking to deploy and manage the best Wi-Fi infrastructure inside the home to enable the connectivity of a growing number of Wi-Fi devices, and to offer a richer complement of value-added services such as high-speed Internet, UHD TV, voice over IP, home security, energy management, cloud computing and gaming. To meet the connectivity and bandwidth demands of such wireless infrastructure, service providers have migrated from home gateways with single-band 2.4GHz 802.11n to dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz home gateways and mesh nodes, which include support for 802.11ac and the draft Wi-Fi 6 standards. The Wi-Fi 6 standard not only supports faster speeds but also allows more devices to be simultaneously connected within the home, which is a crucial requirement as the average number of connected devices per household will continue to grow rapidly. Furthermore, service providers desire to offer their customers a seamless Wi-Fi connectivity experience outside the home. They have increased investments in the deployment of Wi-Fi hotspots to support sophisticated roaming and authentication with other hotspots and with customers’ home gateways. As a result, service providers use Wi-Fi to offer a higher performance, lower cost alternative to traditional mobile cellular services.


• | Retail OEMs. Retail OEMs, including Asus, Belkin International, Inc. and NETGEAR, Inc. are focusing on higher performance Wi-Fi as consumers are increasingly motivated to invest in higher-performance Wi-Fi for their homes. Consumers desire high-performance Wi-Fi throughout the home to connect many devices including laptops, 

- 2 -

smartphones, tablets, TVs, gaming consoles, wireless speakers, thermostats, smoke detectors, home security and other Internet of Things, or IoT applications. As a result, retail OEMs strive to offer routers and mesh repeaters with the latest Wi-Fi technology and performance to provide customers’ homes with the fastest and most reliable speeds. Accordingly, we believe high-performance Wi-Fi routers will constitute an increasing portion of retail OEM router sales. 

• | Enterprise OEMs. Enterprise OEMs for enterprise networking are seeking to meet the demands of an increasingly mobile workforce that is connecting to the network via multiple devices beyond a desktop or laptop, such as smartphones and tablets. Enterprises are also seeking to optimize the costs of their networking infrastructure by adopting cost-effective wireless architecture. As a result, enterprise OEMs are increasingly adopting higher performance Wi-Fi in their products to achieve higher speeds and improved wireless network capacity. Capacity refers to the amount of data that can be supported in a given frequency or channel. 802.11ac access points can support almost three times the capacity of 802.11n access points, and Wi-Fi 6 provides even more capacity. Higher capacity translates into a lower cost per bit, which is an important metric when tens, hundreds, or even thousands of access points are deployed in a given enterprise environment. We believe that the combination of higher capacity and lower cost per bit translates into greater enterprise demand for high-performance Wi-Fi enterprise access points.


• | Fixed Wireless Access (FWA). Wireless technology performance has improved to a point where it can provide reliable gigabit level transmissions. This allows wireless to be a viable alternative to fixed line technologies, such as fiber and cable, for last mile broadband access since it does not require the easement and implementation costs to physically deploy the connection. While most FWA systems in the past have used cellular or even proprietary technologies, Wi-Fi (due to its advancements starting with 802.11ac) is now comparable in performance to these incumbent technologies. In addition, Wi-Fi based systems, due to their simplicity versus cellular, have lower costs for not only the base station but also the modems at the end-customer. This may provide an augmentation to the base station connectivity for a next generation 5G network build. Our massive MIMO technology in addition to other features, allows FWA systems to extract the most performance and reliability at the lowest possible costs for FWA. We have existing and new relationships with suppliers and service providers to explore FWA systems.


• | Consumer Electronics OEMs. A more robust Wi-Fi network inside the home has enabled a proliferation of connected Wi-Fi devices and has driven an increasing need for better delivery of content to those Wi-Fi-enabled devices. As a result, consumer electronics OEMs are seeking to incorporate high-performance Wi-Fi in their products. We believe high-performance Wi-Fi is becoming a differentiator in consumer purchase decisions for high-end products which deliver optimal user experience and, as a result, we believe consumer electronics device OEMs will increasingly enable devices, such as 4K UHD TVs, over-the-top set top boxes, and gaming consoles with higher performance Wi-Fi. 

Industry Challenges 
Designing Wi-Fi solutions to provide the highest levels of performance is imperative to address increased traffic demands, yet remains very challenging due to the following factors. 
Increasing Wi-Fi Speeds. 802.11ac-based devices are up to 10 times faster than prior generation devices, and Wi-Fi 6 will be even faster, sending data at gigabits per second through the wireless channel, an unpredictable medium filled with physical obstacles, such as walls, doors, and furniture, as well as radio interference, such as Bluetooth, Zigbee, microwave ovens, car alarms, cordless phones and baby monitors. As a result, more advanced digital signal processing techniques, such as MIMO, MU-MIMO, and explicit transmit beamforming, are required to keep up with the increasing performance requirements. A device incorporating MIMO technology transmits signals using more than one antenna and receives signals using more than one antenna, which allows the device to have increased speed and range. MU-MIMO allows multiple client devices to be served by a Wi-Fi access point simultaneously. Explicit transmit beamforming is a technique that enables gateways and access points to direct their signals toward a client rather than covering a larger area, which increases transmission efficiency and ultimately improves Wi-Fi speed, range and reliability. Together, these techniques increase the performance level of 802.11ac and 802.11ax solutions with improved range and more reliable connections, while serving an increased number of simultaneous users.
Spectrum Sharing. Wi-Fi operates in a limited, unlicensed wireless spectrum, as regulated in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC. While the 5GHz spectrum used by 802.11ac and Wi-Fi 6 is inherently wider relative to the 2.4GHz spectrum, it is not always entirely available due to regulatory constraints that vary from country to country. For example, in many parts of the world, much of the 5GHz spectrum is reserved for military, weather radar, and air traffic control applications. These regulations mandate that Wi-Fi devices vacate such reserved spectrum upon detection of higher priority applications. To reliably achieve maximum speeds with 802.11ac and Wi-Fi 6, some of this restricted spectrum needs 
- 3 -

to be utilized. Therefore, a method referred to as Dynamic Frequency Selection, or DFS, needs to be implemented to accurately detect when these channels are available for Wi-Fi use. As bands become wider, it becomes increasingly critical for Wi-Fi applications to operate in the DFS spectrum. In the United States, in the 5GHz frequency band, there are 16 DFS channels that can be used in addition to the nine non-DFS channels. Therefore, a network that can use these DFS channels will increase total system capacity by almost threefold. Implementing efficient use of DFS channels requires complex algorithms. 
Competing Traffic. The types of traffic carried by Wi-Fi are rapidly increasing as technology providers seek to enable more device connectivity and value-added services. Each type of traffic has unique quality metrics that must be met in order to create a satisfactory user experience. For example, voice and video latencies must be low to ensure that users do not perceive any gaps in performance. Internet webpage and email traffic are sporadic by nature and typically do not have strict latency guidelines. As a result, certain traffic types need to be prioritized over others. A comprehensive Quality of Service, or QoS, mechanism is needed to prioritize traffic types, guarantee on-time delivery of specific traffic types ahead of others, and scale to meet the increased number of Wi-Fi clients in a network.
Rapid Evolution of Industry Standards. The IEEE standardization body continually strives to improve Wi-Fi functionality and performance. For example, from 1997 to 2013, Wi-Fi maximum speeds increased from 1Mbps under the 802.11 standard to 6.8 gigabit per second, or Gbps, with the 802.11ac revision, and 9.7 Gbps for draft Wi-Fi 6. All competitors in the Wi-Fi solutions market design their products according to the same IEEE Wi-Fi standards, which have become more complex as each subsequent standard includes an increasing number of specifications for both basic and optional features. While all Wi-Fi products need to incorporate all of the basic specifications under the standards, competitors in the high-performance Wi-Fi solutions market distinguish themselves by the speed with which they introduce new products and the degree to which their products are able to support advanced specifications and optional features such as explicit transmit beamforming, high-order MIMO, and MU-MIMO. Some competitors decide to only implement the mandatory specifications and leave more complex optional features out of their products.
Legacy Wi-Fi Processing Architecture. There are seven distinct layers of software functions needed for one Wi-Fi device to transmit data to another under IEEE Wi-Fi standards. Layers one and two comprise the Wi-Fi protocol stack, and layers three and above are referred to as higher-layer network functions. Historically, Wi-Fi chipsets were architected such that the host central processing unit, or CPU, inside a gateway or access point handled the majority of the higher-layer network processing activity. However, as Wi-Fi speeds increase, the ability of the CPU to sustain maximum Wi-Fi data bandwidth while also performing other tasks is compromised. As a result, in order for the end product to meet its performance specifications, the Wi-Fi chipset must be capable of processing a greater proportion of both the Wi-Fi protocol stack and network functions to ensure that host CPUs have the bandwidth to operate properly.
Network Interference Management. As Wi-Fi usage increases, higher levels of network congestion will occur. This was especially common with 802.11b 2.4GHz networks, which only had three non-overlapping channels. The limited number of channels meant that there was a high likelihood that competing devices were using the same channel, thereby degrading performance. While the industry’s transition to 5GHz networks temporarily helped to alleviate such degradation by offering more channels, similar congestion and degradation of performance may occur over time. A Wi-Fi management system is needed to constantly monitor and optimize Wi-Fi network performance. Such a system would not only oversee one access point or gateway within a particular home, but would also have the capability to monitor a whole network of access points, which can comprise millions of Wi-Fi clients.
Our Solution and Competitive Strengths
Our four generations of Wi-Fi solutions have been designed to achieve and maintain market leadership. Historically, in each case where we have introduced a new high-performance Wi-Fi solution compliant with the 802.11 IEEE standard, we have done so well before our competitors have introduced a comparable product with the same features. This first-mover advantage has enabled us to market and monetize our solutions and capture key new customers and design wins while our competitors were still in the product development phase. This advantage has been particularly evident in the service provider market for home networking applications. Due to long design and deployment cycles, service providers may only undertake major product updates every few years. As a result, the ability to secure a service provider design win for a solution with advanced features can create a market advantage that lasts for months to years, depending on various factors, including how quickly a competitor releases a comparable product, how the performance of the competing product compares to ours, and how the timing of such release relates 
- 4 -

to the service provider’s design and deployment cycle. We believe our success in pioneering previous Wi-Fi solutions has also given us a head start in the development of next generation Wi-Fi solutions. 
We strive to deliver the industry’s highest speed, broadest coverage, highest capacity, and most reliable performance through advanced software and system-level algorithms, Wi-Fi protocol processing using embedded CPUs, and the introduction of a cloud-based Wi-Fi network analytics and monitoring solution. Our solutions allow us to address the industry challenges posed by increasing Wi-Fi speeds, limited spectrum, increasing traffic, legacy Wi-Fi processing architectures and network interference management. We deliver proprietary feature set extensions beyond standard requirements, offering significant performance advantages to the user. Our innovative solutions have historically addressed the service provider market for home networking applications such as home gateways, repeaters, and STBs, and we are increasingly addressing additional end markets, with solutions for home networking and small and medium business applications (e.g., routers and repeaters), enterprise networking (e.g., access points), FWA and consumer applications, including wireless streaming of audio and video, wireless TVs, and wireless speakers.
Performance Benefits We Provide Our Customer Partners and their End Users
We believe our Wi-Fi solutions enable the highest overall level of Wi-Fi performance in the market relative to network speed, range, capacity and reliability. A high-performing solution results in a positive user experience and high level of satisfaction from customers, service providers and their subscribers. The performance benefits that we provide to our customer partners and their end users are set forth below.

• | Integrated 2.4GHz and 5GHz Solutions. Our most recent solutions include both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz capabilities. As a result, our customer partners only need to design in a single chipset, instead of one for each frequency band. This integrated solution not only enables a more streamlined design process, but also maximizes interoperability and performance.


• | Streamlined Integration and Faster Time to Market. We have designed host offload technology, which allows the majority of Wi-Fi functions to be executed within our baseband chips. This offload software capability streamlines the integration of our chipsets into customer and reference design partner platforms. In addition, our experienced customer engineering support team engages with our OEM and ODM customers and partners early in their respective design cycles, which we believe accelerates their product development and ultimately optimizes product performance.


• | Improved Subscriber Experience and Increased Subscriber Retention. Our Wi-Fi solutions are high-performance solutions, which helps create a positive subscriber experience when using Wi-Fi. Our Wi-Fi solutions also provide enhanced network performance capabilities, which enable service providers to offer their subscribers a broader range of value-added products and services such as wireless phone service, wireless set-top boxes and seamless streaming of ultra-high definition video. By offering such premium products and services, we believe service providers are able to generate more revenue per subscriber and deliver a better subscriber experience, which contributes to improved subscriber retention.


• | Premium Product Positioning. Because of our customers’ product benefits, we believe our high-performance Wi-Fi solutions allows them to command a premium with subscribers, or in the case of retail-oriented products, the end consumer. This allows greater profitability and customer satisfaction for our customer partners.


• | Longer Lifecycle and Reduced Capital Investment. Subscribers desire the most up-to-date technologies from their service providers. Devices featuring our solutions offer the leading edge of Wi-Fi technology, and therefore have a longer lifecycle and time to obsolescence. Additionally, a high-performing Wi-Fi infrastructure results in lower network expenditures for service providers by offloading cellular data, thereby reducing the burden on the cellular network.


• | Fewer Service Disruptions and Lower Support Costs. Because our Wi-Fi solutions support the most advanced IEEE Wi-Fi optional specifications, they provide higher speed, greater range and better reliability than our competitors’ products, which increases the quality of data transmission and improves Wi-Fi connectivity within a given area. We believe the high quality and reliability of our Wi-Fi solutions results in fewer service disruptions, and therefore reduces customer complaints and the need for support calls and on-site service requests.


• | Automated Network Management. We have a cloud-based Wi-Fi analytics and monitoring platform which allows us to remotely collect data from our products in the field. The dataset helps us to efficiently support our customers, improve

- 5 -

future performance of our products and improve our customers’ ability to ramp deployments, ultimately accelerating our time to market. 
Our competitive strengths include:

• | Market Leadership through Support of the Most Advanced Specifications. We design Wi-Fi solutions that support the most advanced IEEE Wi-Fi optional specifications, which allow us to be a leader in terms of both performance and innovation. For example, we shipped the world’s first 4x4 MIMO solution when our competitors were providing products with support for only 2x2 or 3x3 MIMO. Today, we are the first and only company shipping the full 8x8 MIMO specification of both 802.11ac with our QSR10G Wi-Fi solution, and Wi-Fi 6 with our QSR10GU-AX solution currently sampling, which we believe allows us to offer the highest speed as well as the farthest range. Also, we are the first and only company shipping samples of a 5x5 MIMO solution, which is addressing the Wi-Fi 6 standard. While some of our competitors offer a wider variety of products, many of those products incorporate only basic features for low-performance applications outside our target market segments. In contrast, we focus on segments of the market where advanced features are critical for the targeted application to provide higher performance, such as whole home coverage or video delivery over Wi-Fi. 


• | Proprietary Technology Architectures. We design proprietary technology architectures that we deliver through our high-performing chipsets. The 802.11 standard does not dictate implementation and a significant portion of the design is vendor discretionary. We were the first to commercially introduce several new technology architectures, including the first 4-stream and only 802.11n 4x4 chipset in 2010, the first 4x4 802.11ac chipset in 2013 ,the first 802.11ac 8x8 chipset in 2015, and first 802.11ax 8x8 chipset in 2017. In 2018, we introduced the concept of adaptive MIMO at 5GHz, which allows dynamically switching between 8x8 MIMO and dual 4x4 MIMO depending on radio conditions. We were also the first to introduce a 5x5 MIMO chipset architecture. We were the first Wi-Fi solution provider to have integrated 12 chains on a single baseband chip die and eight transmit and eight receive chains on a single radio frequency chip, or RFIC, die as part of a 10Gbps Wi-Fi access point solution. Transmit and receive chains refer to circuitry in the RFIC responsible for transmitting and receiving data, respectively. We believe our proprietary architectures are a key part of what enables us to successfully compete against our larger, more established competitors. 


• | Advanced Software and System-Level Algorithms. We enable our innovative Wi-Fi solutions with advanced proprietary software and system-level algorithms that provide superior functionality. For example, we were the first to commercially introduce a number of features built on the 802.11 standards, such as 4x4 MIMO, 5x5 MIMO, 8x8 MIMO, MU-MIMO, and 4x4 universal beamforming. We have integrated advanced digital signal processing, or DSP, algorithms in each of our baseband chips. The process of detecting and decoding the desired data from a noisy environment requires sophisticated DSP algorithms, which we have developed over the last 10 years. These algorithms include explicit transmit beamforming, MIMO, MU-MIMO, and others. We believe these algorithms are crucial to the performance and stability of products integrating our solutions.


• | Pure Focus on High-Performance Wi-Fi Solutions and Deep Wireless Engineering Expertise. Our research and development, engineering, manufacturing, sales, and marketing activities are focused mainly on high-performance Wi-Fi solutions, which we believe gives us an advantage over many of our competitors who do not focus exclusively on Wi-Fi.


• | Deep Relationships with Our Customers and Reference Design Partners. We have built collaborative relationships with our customers and reference design partners, many of whom are industry leaders. We believe these relationships provide us with enhanced visibility into their future requirements. We often collaborate with these leaders at the front end of the design cycle and help them architect their next-generation products. We believe we have a strong industry reputation for responsiveness and delivering Wi-Fi solutions that meet or exceed our customers and reference design partners’ technological requirements, as well as their overall business needs.

Our Strategy
The key components of our strategy include the following: 

• | Continue to Deliver Wi-Fi Innovation. The Wi-Fi industry is constantly evolving as new technologies emerge and standards are updated. We intend to continue our investment in research and development to drive further innovation, including new Wi-Fi standards, and performance differentiation, so as to maintain a market leadership position in the Wi-Fi marketplace.


• | Expand Share in Service Provider Market. We intend to leverage our growing number of service provider and OEM and ODM relationships to aggressively market our solutions’ competitive advantages and increase our footprint among service providers. This market is characterized by long product lifecycles and stable customer engagements with greater visibility into future revenue. In addition, we intend to expand our geographic reach beyond North America and Western Europe, which are currently the predominant end markets for our Wi-Fi solutions.


• | Leverage Industry Partnerships to Promote Adoption of Our Solutions. We maintain partnerships with several technology industry leaders to ensure the compatibility of our solutions with other components of the end product, and to promote the adoption of our Wi-Fi solutions. We will seek to broaden and strengthen these partnerships to drive design wins and establish incumbency.


• | Address Other Wi-Fi Market Segments. We have addressed only a small portion of the retail Wi-Fi and the small and medium business market opportunities, and we have not yet entered the broader enterprise, FWA and consumer electronics markets. We intend to leverage our existing technologies and solutions, as well as broaden our Wi-Fi solutions portfolio, to continue to expand our presence in the retail Wi-Fi market and address the small and medium business, enterprise, consumer electronics, industrial and other markets.


• | Broaden Solutions Beyond Wi-Fi. We believe our existing technologies and wireless engineering expertise, as well as our deep industry relationships, provide us an opportunity to expand beyond the Wi-Fi market through a combination of organic investments and acquisitions.

Our Products and Technology 
Our differentiated Wi-Fi system architecture typically consists of a radio frequency integrated circuit (RFIC) and a digital baseband system-on-chip, or baseband SoC. The RFIC transmits and receives at a particular frequency, and the baseband SoC implements system-level algorithms to process physical layer (layer one) functions and additional logic that executes software to process 802.11 protocols from the signals received to and from the RFIC. The RFIC and baseband SoC are placed on a printed circuit board called a “reference design”, where they interact with the rest of the hardware and software system of the end product. In more recent implementations our architecture includes two RFICs to address dual-band capability, while still operating with one baseband SoC.
The typical applications that use our current solutions are:

• | Access Point and Gateways. These applications are at the core of wireless home networking and enterprise access. Our initial solutions supported 2-stream applications with 4x4 5GHz 802.11n, and we have continuously innovated to deliver increasing speeds, culminating in our latest 12-stream (8x8 5GHz + 4x4 2.4GHz), 10Gbps, dual-band dual-concurrent Wi-Fi 6 offering. Our solutions have also evolved from primarily supporting real-time video delivery over Wi-Fi to supporting voice, video, and data. We seek to extend our industry-leading position by continuing to develop solutions to support the next-generation of Wi-Fi applications. We believe that the increasing demands on wireless home networks and enterprise applications will help drive the need for high performance access points and gateways in the marketplace, which we believe will also contribute to greater demand for high-performance Wi-Fi solutions with higher average selling prices, or ASPs, given the benefits they provide to our customers.


• | Clients. We provide Wi-Fi solutions for non-mobile client applications such as video clients (including STBs). We believe the performance advantages of our solutions will better support the latest generation of UHD STBs, which have higher Wi-Fi speed requirements. In addition, increased speed, range, capacity and reliability can be achieved when our client solutions are used in conjunction with our access point and gateway solutions.

• | Repeaters and Mesh Nodes. In certain challenging networking environments, repeaters and mesh nodes can be used to provide extended Wi-Fi coverage. Our repeater and distributed access point solutions support advanced functionality, including setup, management, and client connectivity features. We believe repeaters, along with our access point solutions, can play an important role in addressing the growing consumer demand for whole-home coverage.

We differentiate our solutions portfolio by designing and implementing a variety of innovative system architecture and software features that are aimed at solving the challenges of high-performance wireless networking, including:
Increasing Wi-Fi Speeds

• | Transmit Beamforming. Beamforming is critical to effectively compete in the high-performance Wi-Fi market as it enables gateways and access points to direct their signals toward a client to increase transmission efficiency and improve Wi-Fi speed and range. We were the first to apply Wi-Fi transmit beamforming technology to four antennas, and have continued to optimize it for eight antennas. Beamforming is an integral part of our solutions, and our engineering team includes leading system algorithm experts to address the design and implementation challenges in this field.


• | Advanced MIMO and MU-MIMO. MIMO technology multiplies the capacity of a wireless connection by allowing access points to transmit and receive multiple streams of data at the same time. MU-MIMO technology permits not only multiple streams to a single device, but also enables multiple client devices to receive multiple streams of data at the same time. When combined, these two features allow the most efficient use of a given channel by offering the highest bits per hertz. A 4x4 MIMO transmission uses four antennas, and an 8x8 MIMO transmission uses eight antennas. We refer to these technologies as higher-order MIMO. Four antennas are used in the 2.4GHz band, and four or eight antennas are used in the 5GHz band. We were the first to commercially introduce MIMO and MU-MIMO for 4x4 802.11n, 4x4 802.11ac, 8x8 802.11ac, and 8x8 Wi-Fi 6. We have experienced wireless system architects and software engineers to lead the implementation of these technologies.

Addressing Spectrum Scarcity

• | SuperDFS Dynamic Smart Channel Selection. SuperDFS is a set of system-level algorithms that combine RFIC, baseband, and software functions to select a particular DFS channel that has the least interference and best system capacity. Our detection mechanisms have been optimized to pass strict FCC product certification guidelines without being overly reactive in DFS frequencies.

Handling Quality-of-Service with different Traffic Types

• | IQStream Advanced Traffic Management. IQstream is a proprietary system-level algorithm that classifies and prioritizes all types of Wi-Fi traffic in order for the most critical traffic to be delivered with the least interruption. For example, IQStream allows the prioritization of real-time HD video or voice call transmissions over lower priority data such as email and Internet webpage access.

Easier Integration into Existing Designs

• | Host Offload. We have implemented host offload technology, which allows the majority of Wi-Fi functions to be executed within our baseband chips. This not only frees up the resources of the host CPU, but also requires less software integration and optimization between our Wi-Fi chips and the host CPU during system design. This significantly decreases our customers’ product development time.

Network Management

• | Cloud-based Wi-Fi Monitoring and Analytics Platform. Our proprietary cloud-based platform comprises a debugging agent embedded within a product, such as an access point, which sends Wi-Fi data to an analytics and monitoring engine in the cloud. This system permits remote, real-time issue identification and resolution. This allows us to deliver enhanced customer support and Wi-Fi performance.


• | Smart Wi-Fi Management. Our smart Wi-Fi managed home solution provides a comprehensive solution for total home connectivity. This solution is comprised of a software framework, SONiQ, for the management of multiple access points or repeaters, and a range of repeater hardware reference designs. Together, these two elements manage and optimize home Wi-Fi networks and help provide maximum speed and quality of experience for our customers.

We are currently shipping our second generation 4x4 802.11n, third generation 4x4 802.11ac Wi-Fi solutions and fourth generation 8x8 802.11ac in volume, as well as production samples of our fifth generation Wi-Fi 6 10Gbps Wi-Fi solution.
Our Customers
Our customer relationships are primarily driven by the end user demands for our high-performance Wi-Fi solutions. This influences our customer partners, regardless of end market focus. Our primary customer partners currently consist of service providers, where we direct a majority of our strategic design efforts. Service providers seek to offer competitive products to their end user subscribers. As a result, we sell our Wi-Fi solutions directly to global OEMs and ODMs that serve these service providers and other end markets we target. In addition, we sell our Wi-Fi solutions to third-party distributors who in turn resell to OEMs and ODMs. OEMs incorporate our Wi-Fi solutions into their products, which are then sold to their own customers, such as service providers, retailers, enterprises, small and medium businesses, and retail consumers. To date, we have primarily addressed the service provider market for home networking applications, including home gateways, repeaters, and set-top boxes. We are seeking to increasingly address additional end markets with solutions for (i) retail OEMs for home networking as well as small and medium business applications (e.g., routers and repeaters), (ii) enterprise OEMs for enterprise networking applications (e.g., access points), and (iii) consumer electronics OEMs for consumer applications, including wireless streaming of audio and video, wireless TVs, and wireless speakers. We believe the life cycles of our customers’ products can range from approximately one year to five years or more depending on the end market.
Some OEMs purchase our Wi-Fi solutions directly from us and use them in the design and manufacture (directly or through their third-party contract manufacturers) of their own products. Other OEMs utilize ODMs to design and build subsystem products incorporating our Wi-Fi solutions, which the OEMs then purchase from the ODM and incorporate into the OEM products. Accordingly, we ship our Wi-Fi solutions either directly to the OEM, its contract manufacturer, or its ODM, based on the requirements of each OEM. However, we maintain close relationships with the target OEM to monitor OEM end-market demand as the initial Wi-Fi solution design win is generally awarded by the OEM.
Service providers purchase the products they sell to, or subsidize for use by, their subscribers through OEMs and ODMs. We typically do not enter into formal agreements with service providers, and our relationship with service providers varies depending on the service provider’s strategy: 

• | Service Providers Selecting Wi-Fi Technology Directly. Some service providers, typically those with large subscriber bases, require that a specific Wi-Fi solution be designed into the OEM products they purchase. As a result, although our customers are OEMs and ODMs, we maintain close relationships with these service providers since they award design wins for our Wi-Fi solutions. After a design win is achieved, we continue to work closely with the service providers to assist them and their OEMs and ODMs throughout their product development and early deployment, which can often last six to 18 months. 


• | Service Providers Selecting OEM / ODM Products. Other service providers, typically those with smaller subscriber bases, do not require that specific Wi-Fi solutions be designed into the OEM or ODM products they purchase. As a result, the OEM or ODM is the key decision maker with respect to awarding design wins and may incorporate the winning design into their products for numerous service providers. We maintain close relationships with our OEM and ODM customers to secure design wins and monitor end-market demand. 

For the years ended December 30, 2018, December 31, 2017, and January 1, 2017, substantially all of our revenues have been derived from sales of our Wi-Fi solutions to customers serving the service provider home networking market and were generated outside the United States based on ship-to destinations, and we anticipate that the vast majority of our shipments will continue to be delivered outside the United States. Although almost all shipments are delivered outside the United States, we believe that a significant number of the Wi-Fi products that include our semiconductors, such as access points, gateways, set-top boxes and repeaters, are ultimately directed and sold by OEM customers to service providers in North America and Western Europe with an increasing presence in Latin America and Southeast Asia. To date, all of our revenue has been denominated in U.S. dollars. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment Information and Operations by Geographic Area, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our operations by geographic area. While licensing and non-recurring arrangements are not part of our primary focus, we may enter into such arrangements on an opportunistic basis from time to time.

In 2018, four customers accounted for approximately 52% of our revenue. In 2017, six customers accounted for approximately 52% of our revenue. In 2016, five customers accounted for approximately 54% of our revenue. Technicolor SA, purchasing on behalf of various service providers, accounted for approximately 29% of our revenue in 2018. 
Sales and Marketing
We sell our solutions worldwide using a combination of a direct sales force and third-party distributors. We employ direct sales teams in the United States, Europe and Asia who support our OEM and ODM customers and service providers. We have located our sales and marketing teams near our existing OEM and ODM customers and larger service providers in the United States (serving North America), France, Netherlands, Spain, Singapore, China and Taiwan (serving greater Asia). Each salesperson has specific end market expertise. We also employ field application engineers, or FAEs, typically co-located with our direct sales teams, who provide technical pre-sales support to our sales team and assistance to existing and potential customers throughout their design-in and qualification cycles. Our FAE team is organized by end markets as well as core competencies in hardware, software, and wireless systems necessary to support our customers and their target service providers.
To supplement our direct sales team, we have contracts with several independent distributors in Taiwan, Korea, and China. We selected these independent distributors based on their ability to provide effective field sales, marketing communications and technical support for our Wi-Fi solutions. In the case of distributors, our customers place orders through distributors who purchase inventory from us.
Our sales have historically been made on the basis of purchase orders rather than customer specific, long-term agreements. All of our material terms and conditions are consistent with general industry practice but vary from customer to customer. We typically receive purchase orders 16 to 18 weeks ahead of the customer’s desired delivery date. Because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice, we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of our future revenue.
Our marketing team focuses on our solutions strategy and road maps, product marketing, new solution introduction processes, demand assessment and competitive analysis, marketing communication and public relations. 
Manufacturing
We use a fabless semiconductor business model and rely on third-party contractors to fabricate, assemble, and test our chipset designs. We believe this outsourced manufacturing approach gives us access to the best available process technology, reduces our capital requirements, and allows us to focus our resources on the design, development, marketing, sales and customer integration of our Wi-Fi solutions. We use industry-standard complementary metal-oxide semiconductor manufacturing process technology, which enables us to produce cost-effective products and achieve high-performance. We partner with our third-party contractors to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and to secure the necessary level of manufacturing capacity. We work closely with these contractors to improve our chipset’s manufacturability, enhance yields, lower product and manufacturing costs, and improve quality. We are committed to continuous improvements in our chipset design for better manufacturability and in our third-party contractors’ manufacturing processes to achieve the high-quality, reliability, cost, and the performance metrics targets.
Wafer Fabrication, Assembly and Testing
We purchase silicon wafers from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, or TSMC, in Taiwan, our foundry partner, which are then shipped to third-party contractors who assemble and test our chipsets. We currently use several process nodes ranging from 90nm to 28nm. We qualify and utilize multiple TSMC facilities to ensure consistent production performance and redundancy, which is a critical component of our supply chain strategy. We currently use Advanced Semiconductor Engineering in Taiwan and Signetics Corporation in Korea for assembly and testing. All of our material terms and conditions are consistent with general industry practice but vary from vendor to vendor. Our inventory is distributed from the third-party contractors and a contracted warehouse in Taiwan. We require our third-party contractors to have comprehensive quality manufacturing systems, certified at International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, 9000 levels.

Research and Development
We believe that our success depends on our ability to enhance our existing Wi-Fi solutions, develop new innovative solutions, and integrate additional capabilities to serve our existing and future target markets. We engage in research and development efforts in four core areas: 

• | System-level algorithm development (core Wi-Fi algorithms and system-level integration);


• | Digital, mixed-signal, and RFIC design (baseband and RFIC Wi-Fi silicon chipsets);


• | Software development (embedded Wi-Fi and network-level drivers); and


• | Reference hardware platforms (board designs for internal use and customer reference).

We also have a team of dedicated customer engineers to support our OEMs and service providers in their integration of our solutions into their products. We believe our competencies can be leveraged to broaden our solutions portfolio within and beyond the Wi-Fi market. 
Our research and development team is comprised of highly skilled engineers and technologists with extensive experience in digital, mixed signal, and RFIC design, system level architecture, and software development. We have assembled our engineering team in the United States, Australia, China, Taiwan, and Russia comprising of 319 engineers worldwide. 
We intend to continue to invest in research and development to support and enhance our existing Wi-Fi solutions and design and develop future product offerings. 
Intellectual Property 
We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, and contractual protections, to protect our core technology and intellectual property. As of December 30, 2018, we had 59 issued patents in the United States and 5 foreign counterpart patents issued in Taiwan. The issued patents in the United States expire beginning in 2026 through 2037. Our issued patents and pending patent applications relate to MIMO systems, algorithms, circuits, system level optimization and wireless network management. 
In addition to our own intellectual property, we also use third-party licenses for certain technologies embedded in our Wi-Fi solutions. These are typically non-exclusive contracts provided under royalty-accruing or paid-up licenses. While we do not believe our business is dependent to any significant degree on any individual third-party license, we expect to continue to use and may license additional third-party technology for our solutions. We also invest in the latest commercially available software design and simulation tools, which enable us to leverage our intellectual property portfolio, improve time to commercialization, and deliver high-performance solutions.
We generally control access to and use of our confidential information through employing internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, consultants, customers, partners and suppliers. Our employees and consultants are required to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment and consulting relationships with us. We also require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived or made in connection with the employment or consulting relationship. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our software, technology or other information that we regard as proprietary intellectual property. 
The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies. From time to time, we have received communications from other third parties, including non-practicing entities, alleging our infringement of their patents, and we may receive additional claims of infringement in the future. In addition, our customers and our customers’ customers may also receive communications regarding alleged infringement of their products that implicate our Wi-Fi solutions, which could trigger warranty and indemnity obligations from us. Any lawsuits could subject us to significant liability for damages, invalidate our proprietary rights and harm our business and our ability to compete. See the section titled “Risk Factors” for additional information.
Competition
We compete with numerous domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources with which to pursue design, development, manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution of their products.
