Our Current Business

On November 1, 2018, our company discontinued the business of selling used automobiles in the United States and Dominican Republic. Upon the change of control of our company, management began to seek a new business direction for our company. With the contribution by Robert Qin Peng of the eVeek assets, we now have a portfolio of iOS and Android applications (apps) and games (collectively the “Apps”). We will adopt different monetization strategies with each of our apps and games – some monetize using only ads, some have both ads and in-app purchases and some are paid apps. Consumers download our Apps through the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store.
Android Apps and Games

Our Android portfolio includes 6 games and 2 apps.

iOS Apps and Games

Our iPhone iOS portfolio includes 5 games and 1 app.

Our iPad iOS portfolio includes 5 games and 1 app.

We currently generate revenue from sales of our paid Apps and minimal revenue from advertisements published on certain Apps. A primary focus for us during the next 12 months is on developing new Apps and modifying existing Apps that we believe can generate increased revenue.

Our employee devotes only 10 hours per week to our affairs and provides services to others in the business of developing, marketing and selling mobile applications. There can be no assurance that concepts for mobile applications developed by our employee will be presented to our company for consideration. With respect to any new applications developed by our employee, our company’s position is that nay such applications developed while they are using the resources of our company, will be owned by our company. At this time, we do not believe that the applications our employee will develop for our company will fall within the types of applications they may develop for other companies. However, no assurance can be given that a conflict will not arise over ownership of the applications developed by our employee, or that they will not become associated with another company that develops applications similar to those of our company. In either event, our company may not have rights to the applications developed by our employee that our company believes we are entitled to own. In the event of a conflict over ownership of applications developed by our employee, our company intends to enter into discussion to resolve the conflict amicably prior to any legal rights or remedies that may be available to our company.

Competition

Management believes that the Apps have the following strengths and weaknesses, relative to the competition in the market:

Strengths and Opportunities

Unique and novel apps and reliable source codes. The market currently includes many apps which are copycat apps; our Apps however are original and novel in their category.

We believe that we can increase our revenue from the development of new apps and improving certain apps that already exist within our portfolio.

Weaknesses

Lack of marketing: Our most significant weakness is that we have never had sufficient capital to undertake any amount of marketing. If we are unable to generate proceeds from the sale of the shares offered under this offering, we will not have funds to be used in marketing to grow our business.

Android and iOS updates. So far the Apps have been updated to the latest available versions in their respective Android and iOS platforms, but future updates could break some functionalities. With each update, some of our Apps’ functionalities become unusable and we must then update our Apps to cure such broken functionalities. Typically, users of Android devices download new operating systems at slow pace and therefore it is anticipated that it will take at least 2 years for the effects to be realized.

Workability. We cannot guarantee that we can make all of our Apps will work with all versions of Android or Apple devices. Therefore, we must predict how our customer base will adopt new Android and iOS operating system versions and modify our Apps to work with the highest percentage of our customers’ devices.
Target Market

We are focused on operating through the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.

Sales & Marketing

Pricing Strategy

We primarily offer free Apps. We have currently have one paid App which is priced at $2.99. This price is seen as optimal for the current type of App. However, changes in the market happen quickly and this pricing could become obsolete or a detriment to our growth.
Marketing Strategy

Of the majority of the Apps we will develop, we intend to offer a free basic version to advertise for a paid premium version of the same App. We believe that free Apps will create the most opportunities for downloads of our Apps.

We will study analytics related to number of downloads of our Apps, daily rankings of our Apps in the Apple App Store and Amazon App Store, how often users use the Apps after purchasing, and sales of Apps. We will use the analytics to make changes to our Apps in an effort to increase sales of the Apps.

We also intend to utilize Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube in an effort to build a customer base for our Apps.

Intellectual Property and Other Contracts

We do not have any patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements, or labor contracts.

Employees

We currently have one part-time employee. Our employee is only part time and is required to only devote ten (10) hours per week to our affairs, it may have a negative impact on our business and planned operations. Further, we cannot any employee from terminating their employment with us at any time
