ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the “Predecessor,” “we,” “our,” or “us” or like terms, when referring to periods prior to September 30, 2014, refer to CNX Gathering LLC (“CNX Gathering”) our predecessor for accounting purposes. References to the “Partnership,” “we,” “our,” “us” or similar expressions, when referring to periods since September 30, 2014, refer to CNX Midstream Partners LP, including its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
We are a growth-oriented master limited partnership focused on the ownership, operation, development and acquisition of natural gas gathering and other midstream energy assets to service our customers’ production in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Our assets include natural gas gathering pipelines and compression and dehydration facilities, as well as condensate gathering, collection, separation and stabilization facilities. We are managed by our general partner, CNX Midstream GP LLC (the “general partner”), a wholly owned subsidiary of CNX Gathering. CNX Gathering is a wholly owned subsidiary of CNX Resources Corporation (NYSE: CNX)(“CNX Resources”). 
We were formed in May 2014 as a joint venture between CNX Resources and Noble Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NBL) (“Noble Energy”). On January 3, 2018, CNX Gas Company LLC (“CNX Gas”), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CNX Resources, acquired from NBL Midstream, LLC (“NBL Midstream”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Energy, NBL Midstream’s 50% interest in CNX Gathering. CNX Resources became our sole sponsor as a result of this transaction, and we refer to CNX Resources as our “Sponsor” throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please read “Developments and Highlights—CNX Resources Acquisition of General Partner” beginning on page 6 for more information related to CNX Gas’ acquisition of NBL Midstream’s indirect interest in our general partner. 
We generate substantially all of our revenues under long-term, fixed-fee gathering agreements with each of CNX Resources and HG Energy II Appalachia, LLC (“HG Energy”), to whom Noble Energy assigned its gathering agreement with us, that are intended to mitigate our direct commodity price exposure and enhance the stability of our cash flows. The gathering agreements with CNX Resources and HG Energy currently include acreage dedications of approximately 375,000 aggregate net acres, comprised of approximately 275,000 Marcellus acres and approximately 100,000 Utica acres, subject to the release provisions set forth in our gas gathering agreements. Although CNX Resources and HG Energy currently account for substantially all of our revenues, we intend to supplement our profitability and future growth by pursuing opportunities to perform gathering services for other unrelated third parties in the future. In addition, we also consider accretive acquisitions, which may include drop downs of additional interests in our existing consolidated assets.
Since our IPO in September 2014, a substantial number of wells have been turned in line in our dedication area, which contributed to our largest gross average combined throughput level of approximately 1,474 BBtu/d for the year ended December 31, 2018 (1,414 BBtu/d excluding third-party volumes under short-haul agreements). Please read “Our Acreage Dedication and Right of First Offer Assets” beginning on page 10 for more information. 
The following charts illustrate our throughput trends and well turn in line activity on our dedicated acreage for the periods indicated: 

(1) Represents average daily combined throughput for the periods presented, excluding third-party volumes under high-pressure short-haul agreements.
 (2) Represents total gross wells turned in line on our dedicated acreage in the periods presented.

Developments and Highlights
CNX Resources Acquisition of General Partner
On January 3, 2018, CNX Gas acquired NBL Midstream’s 50% membership interest in CNX Gathering for cash consideration of $305.0 million and the mutual release of all outstanding claims between the parties (the “Transaction”). In connection with the Transaction, CNX Gas entered into new 20-year fixed-fee gathering agreement with the Partnership. Please read “Our Gathering Agreements with CNX Gas and HG Energy” beginning on page 11 for more information related to our new gathering agreement with CNX Gas. 
Transactions with our Sponsor and HG Energy 
On May 3, 2018, we announced a strategic transaction with our Sponsor, pursuant to which we amended our gas gathering agreement (“GGA”) with CNX Resources to provide for the following (collectively, the “CNX Transactions”):

• | Dedication to the Partnership of approximately 16,100 additional Utica acres in our Anchor Systems (as defined below);


• | Commitment to develop 40 additional wells in the Anchor Systems by 2023, subject to the terms of the GGA;


• | Contribution to the Anchor Systems of a 20” high pressure pipeline in addition to a one-time payment to us of approximately $2.0 million in cash; and


• | Distribution of our 5% interest in the Growth Systems (as defined below) and related assets, as well as our 5% interest in the Moundsville midstream assets that were a part of the Additional Systems (as defined below), to CNX Gathering, which subsequently transferred these assets to HG Energy.

On May 3, 2018, we also announced a strategic transaction with HG Energy, pursuant to which we amended our GGA with HG Energy to provide for the following (collectively, the “HG Energy Transaction”):

• | Release from dedication of approximately 18,000 acres, net to the Partnership, which was comprised of approximately 275,000 acres (or approximately 14,000 acres, net to the Partnership) within the Growth and Additional Systems and approximately 4,200 scattered acres located in the Anchor Systems;


• | Removal of our obligation to provide gathering services or make capital investments in the Growth Systems or in the Moundsville area of the Additional Systems; and


• | Commitment by HG Energy to develop 12 additional wells in the Anchor Systems by 2021, subject to the terms of the HG Energy GGA.

Following the CNX and HG Energy Transactions, the aggregate number of well commitments in the Anchor Systems to the Partnership increased from 140 wells over the course of the next five years to 192 wells. At December 31, 2018, the Partnership has no remaining interests in the Growth Systems or the Moundsville area assets that were historically included within the Additional Systems.
Acquisition of Shirley-Penns System
At December 31, 2017, CNX Gathering owned a 95% noncontrolling interest, while the Partnership owned the remaining 5% controlling interest, in the Additional Systems, which owned the gathering system and related assets commonly referred to as the Shirley-Penns System (the “Shirley-Penns System”). On March 16, 2018, the Partnership acquired the remaining 95% interest in the Shirley-Penns System, pursuant to which the Additional Systems transferred its interest in the Shirley-Penns System on a pro rata basis to CNX Gathering and the Partnership in accordance with each transferee’s respective ownership interest in the Additional Systems. Following such transfer, CNX Gathering sold its aggregate interest in the Shirley-Penns System, which now resides in the Anchor Systems, in exchange for cash consideration in the amount of $265.0 million (the “Shirley-Penns Acquisition”). The Partnership funded the Shirley-Penns Acquisition with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of 6.5% senior notes due 2026 (the “Senior Notes”).

Our Midstream Assets
Our midstream operations consist of two operating segments that we refer to as our “Anchor Systems” and “Additional Systems” based on their relative current cash flows, growth profiles, capital expenditure requirements and the timing of their development.

• | Our Anchor Systems, in which the Partnership owns a 100% controlling interest, include our most developed midstream systems that generate the largest portion of our current cash flows, including our four primary midstream systems (the McQuay, Majorsville, Mamont and Shirley-Penns Systems), a 20” high-pressure pipeline contributed to us in the CNX Transaction and related assets.


• | Our Additional Systems, in which the Partnership owns a 5% controlling interest, include several gathering systems primarily located in the wet gas regions of our dedicated acreage. Revenues from our Additional Systems are currently derived primarily from the Pittsburgh Airport area. Currently, the substantial majority of capital investment in the Additional Systems would be funded by CNX Resources in proportion to CNX Gathering’s 95% retained ownership interest.

As a result of the CNX and HG Energy Transactions described in Business—Developments and Highlights above, the Partnership distributed its ownership interests in (i) our “Growth Systems,” which were primarily located in the dry gas regions of our dedicated acreage in central West Virginia, and (ii) in the Moundsville area assets formerly within the Additional Systems, to CNX Gathering. CNX Gathering subsequently transferred these assets to HG Energy.
In order to maintain operational flexibility, our operations are conducted through, and our operating assets are owned by, our operating subsidiaries. However, neither we nor our operating subsidiaries have any employees. Our general partner has the sole responsibility for providing the personnel necessary to conduct our operations, whether through directly hiring employees or by obtaining the services of personnel employed by CNX Resources or others. All of the personnel who conduct our business are employed or contracted by our general partner and its affiliates, including CNX Resources, but we sometimes refer to these individuals as our employees because they provide services directly to us.

Gathering Assets and Compression and Dehydration Facilities
As of December 31, 2018, we operated 14 facilities to provide our compression and/or dehydration services. The following table provides information regarding our gathering assets and compression and dehydration facilities as of December 31, 2018:

System | Pipelines (in miles) | Average Daily Throughput (BBtu/d)(1) | Maximum Interconnect Capacity(2)(3) (BBtu/d) | Compression (horsepower) | Compression Capacity (BBtu/d)
Anchor Systems | 206 | 1,336 | 2,246 | 100,100 | 1,621 
Additional Systems | 25 | 122 | 250 | — | — 
Total | 231 | 1,458 | 2,496 | 100,100 | 1,621 

(1) Excludes approximately 16 BBtu/d of 2018 activity in the Growth Systems, in which the Partnership had no economic interests at December 31, 2018.
(2) Maximum interconnect capacity is the maximum throughput that can be delivered from the system through physical interconnections to third-party facilities or pipelines.
(3) Our midstream systems currently have interconnects with the following interstate pipelines: Columbia Gas Transmission, Texas Eastern Transmission, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation and Dominion Transmission, Inc.
Condensate Handling Facilities
Our assets include condensate handling facilities in Majorsville, Pennsylvania and Shirley, West Virginia. Each facility provides condensate gathering, collection, separation and stabilization services and has a nominal handling capacity of approximately 2,500 Bbl/d. 
Our Relationship with CNX Resources and CNX Gathering 
CNX Resources, which owns a 100% interest in CNX Gathering, is a Pittsburgh-based natural gas exploration and production company, focusing on the major shale formations of the Appalachian Basin, including the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale. CNX Resources deploys an organic growth strategy focused on developing its resource base. 
CNX Gathering owns our general partner as well as a 95% noncontrolling limited partner interest in our Additional Systems, which, combined with our right of first offer on those interests, may provide opportunities for us to grow our distributable cash flow through a series of acquisitions of these retained interests over time. However, CNX Gathering is under no obligation to offer to sell us any assets, including our right of first offer (“ROFO”) assets, unless and until it otherwise intends to dispose of such assets, and we are under no obligation to buy any assets from CNX Gathering. In addition, we do not know when or if CNX Gathering will make any offers to sell assets to us. 
The Partnership owns a 100% controlling interest in the Anchor Systems and a 5% controlling interest in the Additional Systems. Through our ownership of all of the outstanding general partner interests in our operating subsidiaries, the Partnership has voting control over, and the exclusive right to manage, the day-to-day operations, business and affairs of our midstream systems. 
Our Acreage Dedication and Right of First Offer 
In January 2019, our existing dedicated acreage covered approximately 375,000 aggregate net acres, comprised of approximately 275,000 Marcellus acres and approximately 100,000 Utica acres, subject to the release provisions set forth in our gas gathering agreements. Our gathering agreement with CNX Gas provides that, in addition to our existing dedicated acreage, any future acreage covering the Marcellus Shale formation that is acquired by CNX Gas in an area that covers over 4,100 square miles in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, which we refer to as the “dedication area,” and that is not subject to a pre-existing third-party commitment automatically will be dedicated to us for natural gas midstream services, subject to the release provisions set forth in each agreement. 
Our gathering agreement with CNX Gas also grants us ROFO rights to provide midstream services on certain of CNX Gas’ acreage, which we call the ROFO acreage. The ROFO acreage currently includes approximately 195,000 aggregate net acres that are not currently dedicated to us. Our ROFO acreage also includes any future acreage covering the Marcellus Shale formation that is acquired by CNX Gas in an area that covers over 11,800 square miles in Pennsylvania, which we refer to as the “ROFO area,” and that is not subject to a pre-existing third-party commitment. There are no restrictions under our gathering agreements (discussed below) on the ability of CNX Gas to transfer acreage in the ROFO area, and any such transfer of acreage in the ROFO area will not be subject to our ROFO.  
10

In addition to the initial assets contributed to us in connection with our IPO, CNX Gathering has granted us a ROFO under the omnibus agreement to acquire (i) CNX Gathering’s retained interests in our Additional Systems, (ii) CNX Gathering’s other ancillary midstream assets and (iii) any additional midstream assets that CNX Gathering develops, before CNX Gathering sells any of those interests to any third party during the ten-year period following the completion of our IPO (the “right of first offer period”). CNX Gathering is under no obligation to offer to sell us any assets (including our right of first offer assets, unless and until it otherwise intends to dispose of such assets), and we are under no obligation to buy any assets from CNX Gathering. In addition, we do not know when or if CNX Gathering will make any offers to sell assets to us. While we believe our ROFO are significant positive attributes, they may also be sources of conflicts of interest. CNX Gathering owns our general partner, and there is substantial overlap between the officers and directors of our general partner and the officers and directors of CNX Resources. Please read “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us—We do not have any officers or employees and rely on officers of our general partner and employees of CNX Resources.”
Our Gathering Agreements with CNX Gas and HG Energy
Fees, Well Commitments and Minimum Volume Commitments 
On January 3, 2018, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated GGA, which is a 20-year, fixed-fee gathering agreement with CNX Gas that amended and restated the previous gathering agreement with CNX Gas in its entirety. Although the fees for services we provide in the Marcellus Shale for existing wells that were covered under the prior agreement remain unchanged in the new agreement, and are identical to the fees we charge to HG Energy (discussed below), the Second Amended and Restated GGA also dedicated additional acreage in the Utica Shale in and around the McQuay area and Wadestown area and introduced the following gas gathering and compression rates (shown effective January 1, 2019):
•Gas Gathering:

◦ | McQuay area Utica - a fee of $0.2310 per MMBtu; and


◦ | Wadestown Marcellus and Utica - a fee of $0.3588 per MMBtu.


• | Compression:


◦ | For areas not benefitting from system expansion pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated gas gathering agreement, compression services are included in the base fees; and


◦ | In the McQuay and Wadestown areas, we will receive additional fees of $0.0666 per MMBtu for Tier 1 pressure services (maximum receipt point of pressure of 600 psi) and $0.1333 per MMBtu for Tier 2 pressure services (maximum receipt point of pressure of 300 psi).

The Second Amended and Restated GGA also commits CNX Gas to drill and complete the following number of wells in the McQuay area within the Anchor Systems for the periods indicated, provided that if a certain minimum number of wells have been drilled and completed in the Marcellus Shale, then the remainder of such planned wells must be drilled in the Utica Shale. To the extent the requisite number of wells are not drilled by CNX Gas in a given period, we will be entitled to a deficiency payment per shortfall well as set out in the parenthetical below:

• | January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 - 30 wells (deficiency payment of $3.5 million per well)


• | January 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020 - 40 wells (deficiency payment of $3.5 million per well)


• | May 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021 - 40 wells (deficiency payment of $2.0 million per well)


• | May 1, 2021 to April 30, 2022 - 30 wells (deficiency payment of $2.0 million per well)

In the event that CNX Gas drills wells and completes a number of wells in excess of the number of wells required to be drilled and completed in such period, (i) the number of excess wells drilled and completed during such period will be applied to the minimum well requirement in the succeeding period or (ii) to the extent CNX Gas was required to make deficiency payments for shortfalls in the preceding period, CNX Gas may elect to cause the Partnership to pay a refund in an amount equal to (x) the number of excess wells drilled and completed during the period, multiplied by (y) the deficiency payment paid per well during the period in which the shortfall occurred. CNX Gas satisfied its minimum well obligation for the year ended December 31, 2018.
In connection with the Shirley-Penns Acquisition, the Second Amended and Restated GGA was amended to add a minimum volume commitment (“MVC”) on volumes associated with the Shirley-Penns System through December 31, 2031. The MVC commits CNX Gas to pay the Partnership the wet gas fee under the GGA for all natural gas we gather up to a specified amount per day through December 31, 2031. We expect to recognize minimum revenue of $21.4 million and $34.7 million, respectively, during the years ending December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 under the MVC. For all natural gas the Partnership gathers in excess of the MVC, the Partnership will receive a fee of $0.3588 per MMBtu in 2019, which will escalate by 2.5% on January 1 of each year. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Related Party Transactions for additional information.
11

In connection with the CNX Transactions, the Second Amended and Restated GGA was further amended. Following the amendment, CNX Gas is committed to drill and complete an additional 40 wells above what was outlined in the Second Amended and Restated GGA in the Majorsville/Mamont area within the Anchor Systems through 2023. To the extent the requisite number of wells are not drilled and completed by CNX Gas in a given period, we will be entitled to a deficiency payment per shortfall well as set out in the parenthetical below:

• | July 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020 - an additional 15 wells (deficiency payment of $2.8 million per well) 


• | January 1, 2021 - December 31, 2023 - an additional 25 wells (deficiency payment of $2.8 million per well)

On December 1, 2016, we entered into new fixed-fee gathering agreements with CNX Gas and Noble Energy that replaced the gathering agreements that had been in place since our IPO. Our gathering agreement with Noble Energy was assigned to HG Energy effective June 28, 2017 and was further amended in connection with the HG Energy Transaction. The fixed fee terms for our gathering of HG Energy’s dry gas, wet gas, and condensate remain unchanged following the June 2017 assignment and May 2018 amendment; however, other terms have changed related to our obligations to build infrastructure, the amount of acreage that is dedicated to us and can be released, service and system requirements, and minimum well development provisions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—“Our gathering agreements with our customers provide for the release of dedicated acreage or fee credits in certain situations” for additional details.
Under the gathering agreements with CNX Gas and HG Energy, effective January 1, 2019, we will receive a fee based on the type and scope of the midstream services we provide, summarized as follows:

• | With respect to natural gas from the Marcellus Shale formation that does not require downstream processing, or dry gas, we receive a fee of $0.442 per MMBtu.


• | With respect to natural gas that requires downstream processing, or wet gas, we receive a fee of $0.304 per MMBtu in the Pittsburgh International Airport area and a fee of $0.607 per MMBtu for all other areas in the dedication area.


• | Our fees for condensate services are $5.52 per Bbl in the Majorsville area and the Shirley-Penns area.

Each of the foregoing fees paid by CNX Gas or HG Energy, as applicable, escalates by 2.5% annually, through and including the final calendar year of the initial term. With respect to our gas gathering agreement with CNX Gas, commencing on January 1, 2035, and on each January 1 thereafter, each of the applicable fees will be adjusted pursuant to the percentage change in CPI-U, but such fees will never escalate or decrease by more than 3%. 
Upon completion of their initial 20-year terms, each of our gathering agreements with CNX Gas and HG Energy will continue in effect from year to year until such time as the agreement is terminated by either us or the other party to such agreement on or before 180 days prior written notice.
Other Gathering Agreement Matters 
We gather, compress, dehydrate and deliver dedicated natural gas for CNX Gas and HG Energy in the Marcellus Shale on a first-priority basis and gather, inject, stabilize and/or store all of CNX Gas’ and HG Energy’s dedicated condensate on a first-priority basis in the Majorsville area and gather, inject, stabilize and/or store all of CNX Gas’ dedicated condensate on a first-priority basis in the Shirley-Penns and Pittsburgh International Airport areas, subject to certain exceptions described in our respective gathering agreements.
Pursuant to the terms of our gas gathering agreements, we are entitled to receive ongoing updates from our two largest customers regarding their drilling and development operations, which include detailed descriptions of drilling plans, production details and well locations for periods that range from 24 to 48 months, as well as more general development plans that may extend as far as ten years. In addition, we regularly meet with our customers to discuss our current plans to construct the facilities necessary to provide midstream services to each of them on our dedicated acreage. In the event that we do not perform our obligations under a gathering agreement, CNX Gas or HG Energy, as applicable, will be entitled to certain rights and procedural remedies thereunder, including rate credits, the temporary and/or permanent release from dedication discussed below and indemnification from us. See Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—“Our gathering agreements with our customers provide for the release of dedicated acreage or fee credits in certain situations” for additional details.
Third-Party Services and Commitments 
Our gas gathering agreements, in certain instances, limit the scope of services we provide, which impacts the fees we charge. Under such agreements, we may provide only gathering services, while other parties may provide other services such as compression and/or dehydration. 
The most significant of these agreements is with CNX Gas and relates to the Pittsburgh International Airport area, where we only provide gathering services. With respect to this area, CNX Gas has contracted with a third party for the provision of services, such as compression and dehydration, which we are not providing. Accordingly, we charge CNX Gas a reduced fee for the services we provide with respect to all natural gas and condensate produced from the Pittsburgh International Airport area. While such arrangements have historically been the exception, we do have similar arrangements with other shippers.
12

Title to Our Properties
Our real property interests are acquired pursuant to easements, rights-of-way, permits, surface use agreements, deeds or licenses from landowners, lessors, easement holders, governmental authorities, or other parties controlling surface estate (collectively, “surface agreements”). These surface agreements allow us to use such land for our operations. Thus, the real estate interests on which our pipelines and facilities are located are held by us as grantee, and the party who owns or controls the surface lands, as grantor. We have acquired these surface agreements without any material challenge known to us relating to the title to the land upon which the assets are located, and we believe that we have satisfactory rights and interests to conduct our operations on such lands. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying title of any material surface agreements held by us or to our title to any material surface agreements, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material surface agreements.
Some of the surface agreements that were transferred to us from CNX Gathering required the consent of the grantor or other holder of such rights. CNX Gathering obtained sufficient third-party consents and authorizations and provided notices required for the transfer of the assets necessary to enable us to operate our business in all material respects. With respect to any remaining consents, authorizations or notices that have not been obtained or provided, we have determined these will not have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business should the Partnership or CNX Gathering fail to obtain or provide such consents, authorizations or notices in a reasonable time frame.
Seasonality
Demand for natural gas generally decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the summer and winter months. However, seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or mild summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. These seasonal anomalies can increase demand for natural gas during the summer and winter months and decrease demand for natural gas during the spring and fall months. With respect to our completed midstream systems, we do not expect seasonal conditions to have a material impact on our throughput volumes. Severe or prolonged winters may, however, impact our ability to complete additional well connections or complete construction projects, which may impact the rate of our growth. In addition, severe winter weather may also impact or delay the execution of our customers’ drilling and development plans.
Competition
As a result of our acreage dedications from CNX Gas and HG Energy, we do not compete for the portion of the existing operations of CNX Gas’ and HG Energy’s upstream operations for which we currently provide midstream services, and other than with respect to acreage that may be released, subject to the terms of our gas gathering agreements, we will not compete for future portions of their upstream operations that are dedicated to us pursuant to our gathering agreements. Please read “Our Acreage Dedication and Rights of First Offer.” Nonetheless, CNX Gas and HG Energy have entered into agreements with third parties for the provision of certain midstream services. Please read “Third-Party Services and Commitments” above. In addition, we face competition in attracting third-party volumes to our midstream systems, and these third parties may develop their own midstream systems in lieu of employing our assets.
Regulation of Operations 
Regulation of pipeline gathering services may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our services.
Natural Gas Gathering Pipeline Regulation
Our gathering and transportation operations are exempt from regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”). Although we believe that the natural gas gathering pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish that a natural gas pipeline is a gathering pipeline not subject to FERC NGA jurisdiction, FERC determines whether facilities are gas gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of some our gas gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts, or Congress. If FERC were to determine that our facilities or services provided by us are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by FERC under the NGA and/or the Natural Gas Policy Act (“NGPA”), which could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. 
Other FERC regulations such as policies on open access transportation, market manipulation, ratemaking, gas quality, capacity release and market center promotion, may indirectly impact our business and the markets for products derived from these businesses. Failure to comply with any applicable FERC administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders could subject us to substantial penalties and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Violation of the NGA or NGPA could also result in administrative and criminal remedies and civil penalties, as well as the disgorgement of charges collected for such service in excess of the rate established by FERC.
13

State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities and intrastate transportation pipelines generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. States in which we operate may adopt ratable take and common purchaser statutes, which would require our gathering pipelines to take natural gas without undue discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another similarly situated source of supply. The regulations under these statutes may have the effect of imposing some restrictions on our ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to gather natural gas. States in which we operate may also adopt a complaint-based regulation of natural gas gathering activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering access and rate discrimination. We cannot predict whether such regulation will be adopted and whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies. To date, our midstream systems have not been adversely affected by recent state regulations.
Our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to more stringent application of state regulation of rates and services. Our gathering operations also may be or become subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of gathering facilities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on our operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.
Pipeline Safety Regulation
Some of our natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, (“NGPSA”), as amended by the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (“PSA”), the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996 (“APSA”), the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (“PSIA”), the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 (“PIPES Act”), and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the “2011 Pipeline Safety Act”). The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of natural gas pipeline facilities, while the PSIA establishes mandatory inspections for all U.S. oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in high-consequence areas (“HCAs”).
PHMSA has developed regulations that require pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in HCAs. The regulations require operators, including us, to:

• | perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;


• | identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a HCA;


• | improve data collection, integration and analysis;


• | repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and


• | implement preventive and mitigating actions.

Should our operations fail to comply with PHMSA or comparable state regulations, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. PHMSA released a pre-publication copy of its final hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations that would significantly extend the integrity management requirements to previously exempt pipelines and would impose additional obligations on hazardous liquid pipeline operators that are already subject to the integrity management requirements, but due to the change in Presidential administrations, PHMSA’s final hazardous liquid pipeline safety rule has not yet taken effect, though PHMSA is expected to finalize its hazardous liquid pipeline safety rule soon. PHMSA’s proposed rule would also require annual reporting of safety-related conditions and incident reports for all hazardous liquid gathering lines and gravity lines, including pipelines exempt from PHMSA regulations. 
The National Transportation Safety Board (“NTSB”) has recommended that PHMSA make a number of changes to its rules, including removing an exemption from most safety inspections for natural gas pipelines installed before 1970. Accordingly, PHMSA issued a separate regulatory proposal in July 2015 that would impose pipeline incident prevention and response measures on natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline operators, and in April 2016 published a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (“NPRM”) that would significantly modify existing regulations related to reporting, impact, design construction, maintenance, operations and integrity management of gas transmission and gathering pipelines. The proposed rule addresses four congressional mandates and six recommendations by the NTSB to broaden the scope of safety coverage by adding new assessment and repair criteria for gas transmission pipelines, and by expanding these protocols to include pipelines not formerly regulated by the federal standards. This includes extending regulatory requirements to transmission and gathering pipelines of eight inches and greater in rural Class I areas. While we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives, such legislative and regulatory changes could have a material effect on our operations, particularly by extending more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations (such as integrity management requirements) to pipelines and gathering lines not previously subject to such requirements. As proposed, compliance with the rule may prove 
14

challenging and costly for operators of older pipelines due to the difficulty of locating historic records. While we expect any legislative or regulatory changes to allow us time to become compliant with new requirements, the ultimate impact of the rule on the Partnership remains uncertain until the rulemaking is finalized. 
States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines but most are certified by the Department of Transportation (“DOT”), to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. States may adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines; however, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. State standards may include more stringent requirements for facility design and management in addition to requirements for pipelines. We do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations. Our natural gas pipelines have continuous inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements.
We have incorporated all existing requirements into our programs by the required regulatory deadlines and are continually incorporating the new requirements into procedures and budgets. We expect to incur increasing regulatory compliance costs based on the intensification of the regulatory environment and upcoming changes to regulations as outlined above. In addition to regulatory changes, costs may be incurred when there is an accidental release of a commodity transported by our midstream systems, or a regulatory inspection identifies a deficiency in our required programs.
Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
General
Our natural gas gathering and compression activities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and safety. As an owner or operator of these facilities, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:

• | requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment, imposing emission or discharge limits or otherwise restricting the way we operate;


• | limiting or prohibiting construction activities in areas, such as air quality non-attainment areas, wetlands, endangered species habitat and other protected areas;


• | delaying system modification or upgrades during review of permit applications and revisions;


• | requiring investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate discharges, releases or pollution conditions associated with our operations or attributable to former operations; and


• | enjoining operations deemed to be in non-compliance with permits issued pursuant to or regulatory requirements imposed by such environmental laws and regulations.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and/or criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties and natural resource damages. Certain environmental statutes impose strict or joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, neighboring landowners and other third parties may file common law claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other pollutants into the environment.
The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. As with the midstream industry in general, complying with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations can increase our capital costs to construct, maintain and operate equipment and facilities. While these laws and regulations affect our maintenance capital expenditures and net income, we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we believe that the various activities in which we are presently engaged that are subject to environmental laws and regulations are not expected to materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability to gather natural gas. We cannot assure, however, that future events, such as changes in existing laws or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs. Below is a discussion of the material environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business.
Hydraulic Fracturing Activities
Although we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, substantially all of our customers’ natural gas production on our dedicated acreage is developed from unconventional sources, such as shales, that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the well completion process. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions and similar 
15

agencies, but the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has asserted certain regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing and has moved forward with various regulatory actions, including the issuance of new regulations requiring green completions for hydraulically fractured wells, and has disclosed its intent to develop regulations to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Some states, including states in which we operate, have adopted regulations that could impose more stringent disclosure and/or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations, or otherwise seek to ban some or all of these activities.
Scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities also continues in other ways. In June 2015, the EPA issued its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. The draft report found no systemic negative impacts from hydraulic fracturing. In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water. While the language was changed and included the possibility of negative impacts from hydraulic fracturing, it also included the guidance to industry and regulators on how the process can be performed safely. 
We cannot predict whether any other legislation or regulations will be enacted and if so, what its provisions will be. Additional levels of regulation and/or permits required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal, state or local level could lead to delays, increased operating costs and prohibitions for producers who drill near our pipelines, reduce the volumes of natural gas available to move through our midstream systems and materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.
Hazardous Waste
Our operations generate solid wastes, including some hazardous wastes, that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state laws, which impose requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste. RCRA currently exempts certain wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas, which we handle in the course of our operation, including produced water. However, these exploration and production wastes may still be regulated by the EPA or state agencies under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous solid waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws, and it is possible that certain exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous in the future. On December 28, 2016 the EPA entered into a consent order to resolve outstanding litigation brought by environmental and citizen groups regarding the applicability of RCRA to wastes from oil and gas development activities. The consent order requires the EPA to revise the applicability determination by March 15, 2019.
Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act and comparable state laws, including those states in which we operate, impose various pre-construction and operational permit requirements, noise and emission limits, operational limits, and monitoring, reporting and record-keeping requirements on air emission sources, including on our compressor stations. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations, and/or criminal enforcement actions. Such laws and regulations, for example, require permit limits to address the impacts of noise from our compression operations, and pre-construction permits for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities with the potential to emit air emissions above certain thresholds. Pre-construction permits generally require use of best available control technology, or BACT, to limit air pollutants. 
We may incur capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with complying with existing and recently proposed rules, or with obtaining or maintaining operating or preconstruction permits and complying with federal, state and local regulations related to air emissions (including air emission reporting requirements). However, we do not believe that such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
Climate Change
Climate change continues to be a legislative and regulatory focus. There are a number of proposed and final laws and regulations that limit greenhouse gas emissions, and regulations that restrict emissions could increase our costs should the requirements necessitate the installation new equipment or the purchase of emission allowances. Additional regulation could also lead to permitting delays and additional monitoring and administrative requirements, as well as to impacts on electricity generating operations. 
As part of the Obama administration’s initiative to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural gas industry, the EPA adopted rules to control volatile organic compound emissions from certain oil and gas equipment and operations. In June 2017, the EPA issued a 90-day stay of certain requirements under the methane rule. The stay was vacated in July 2017 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In the interim, in July 2017 the EPA issued a proposed rule that would stay the methane rule for two years. This not-yet-final rule is subject to public notice and comment and may be subject to legal challenges.

Additionally, while Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gas (“GHGs”), the prospect for adoption of significant legislation at the federal level to reduce GHG emissions is perceived to be low at this time. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/ or reducing GHG emissions. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations that limit emissions of GHGs could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that exploration and production operators produce, some of whom are our customers, which could thereby reduce demand for our midstream services.
Further, the EPA, under the Climate Action Plan, elected to regulate GHGs under the Clean Air Act to limit emissions of carbon dioxide from natural gas-fired power plants. On August 3, 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan Rule to cut carbon pollution from existing power plants, which became effective on December 22, 2015. Numerous petitions challenging the Clean Power Plan Rule have been consolidated into one case, West Virginia v. EPA. While the litigation is still ongoing at the circuit court level, a mid-litigation application to the Supreme Court resulted in a stay of the Clean Power Plan Rule. On September 27, 2016, an en banc panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit heard oral arguments in the case. In April 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA’s motion to hold the case in abeyance while the EPA undertakes its review of the regulations. Also in April 2017, the EPA announced that it was initiating a review of the Clean Power Plan consistent with President Trump’s Executive Order 13783, and in October 2017 published a proposed rule to formally repeal the Clean Power Plan. On August 20, 2018, the EPA issued the proposed “Affordable Clean Energy Rule.” The comment period on the proposal closed on October 31, 2018, and the EPA is considering the comments submitted. In September 2018, intervenors asked the D.C. Circuit to discontinue the abeyance and decide the merits of the case. On November 21, 2018, the EPA filed a status report in which the EPA indicated that it expected to take final rulemaking action on a replacement rule for the Clean Power Plan in the first half of 2019.
On November 30, 2016, the EPA finalized amendments to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems source category (Subpart W) of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (“GHGRP”). This final rule adds new monitoring methods for detecting leaks from oil and gas equipment in the petroleum and natural gas systems source category consistent with the leak detection methods in the NSPS. The action also adds emission factors for leaking equipment to be used in conjunction with these monitoring methods to calculate and report GHG emissions resulting from equipment leaks. The NSPS final rule would add reporting of GHG emissions from certain gathering and boosting systems, completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines.
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including sediment, and spills and releases of oil, brine and other substances into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or a delegated state agency. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.
In June 2017, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed a rule that would initiate the first step in a two-step process intended to review and revise the definition of “waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act. The EPA moved forward with the first step on December 11, 2018, when it issued a proposed, revised rule which would replace a prior 2015 rule with pre-2015 regulations and which narrowed language defining “waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act that existed prior to that time. This proposal is subject to public comment and the rulemaking process. The second step would be a notice-and-comment rulemaking in which federal agencies will conduct a substantive reevaluation of such definition. On December 11, 2018, the EPA issued a proposed revised “waters of the United States” rule which would replace the approach in the 2015 rule with pre-2015 regulation.  This proposal is subject to public comment and the rulemaking process.
The primary federal law related specifically to oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act (“OPA”), which amends and augments the oil spill provisions of the Clean Water Act and imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills, or threatened spills, in waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines. The OPA applies joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although defenses exist, they are limited. As such, a violation of the OPA has the potential to adversely affect our operations.
Endangered Species
The Endangered Species Act and related state regulation protect plant and animal species that are threatened or endangered. Some of our operations are located in areas that are or may be designated as protected habitats for endangered or threatened species, including the Northern Long-Eared and Indiana bats, which has a seasonal impact on our construction 
17

activities and operations. New or additional species that may be identified as requiring protection or consideration may lead to delays in permits and/or other restrictions.
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. Certain of our operations are also subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive material.
Employees
The officers of our general partner manage our operations and activities. All of the employees required to conduct and support our operations, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and President, are employed by CNX and are subject to the operational services agreement and omnibus agreement between us, our general partner and CNX. As of December 31, 2018, CNX had approximately 110 employees that provide direct support to our operations pursuant to the operational services agreement and omnibus agreement.
Offices
Our principal offices are located at CNX Center, 1000 CONSOL Energy Drive, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania 15317. 
Insurance
We maintain insurance policies with insurers in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent. We cannot, however, assure that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal and property damage or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices.
Financial Information about Segments 
Please read Part II. Item 8. Note 10–Segment Information, for financial information by business segment including, but not limited to, gathering revenue, net income (loss), and total assets, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
Legal Proceedings
Our operations are subject to a variety of risks and disputes normally incident to our business. As a result, we may, at any given time, be a defendant in various legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. However, we are not currently a party to any material litigation.
