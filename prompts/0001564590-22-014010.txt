ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

GENERAL
 SeaChange International, Inc. (“SeaChange,” the “Company,” “we,” or similar terms), was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on July 9, 1993. We are an industry leader in the delivery of multiscreen, advertising and premium over-the-top (“OTT”) video management solutions. Our software products and services facilitate the aggregation, licensing, management and distribution of video and advertising content for service providers, telecommunications companies, satellite operators, broadcasters and other content providers. We sell our software products and services worldwide, primarily to service providers including: operators, such as Liberty Global, plc., Altice NV, Cox Communications, Inc. and Rogers Communications, Inc.; telecommunications companies, such as Verizon Communications, Inc., and Frontier Communications Corporation; satellite operators such as Dish Network Corporation; and broadcasters.
 Our software products and services are designed to empower video providers to create, manage and monetize the increasingly personalized, highly engaging experiences that viewers demand. Using our products and services, we believe customers can increase revenue by offering services such as video on demand (“VOD”) programming on a variety of consumer devices, including televisions, smart phones, PCs, tablets and OTT streaming players. Our solutions enable service providers to offer other interactive television services that allow subscribers to receive personalized services and interact with their video devices, thereby enhancing their viewing experience. Our products also allow our customers to insert advertising into broadcast and VOD content.
 SeaChange serves an exciting global marketplace where multiscreen viewing is increasingly required, consumer device options are evolving rapidly, and viewing habits are ever-shifting. The primary driver of our business is enabling the delivery of video content in the changing multiscreen television environment. We have expanded our capabilities, products and services to address the delivery of content to devices other than television set-top boxes, namely PCs, tablets, smart phones and OTT streaming players. We believe that our strategy of expanding into adjacent product lines will also position us to further support and maintain our existing service provider customer base. Providing our customers with more scalable software platforms enables them to further reduce their infrastructure costs, improve reliability and expand service offerings to their customers. Additionally, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on new customers entering the multiscreen marketplace and increasingly serve adjacent markets. Our core technologies provide a foundation for software products and services that can be deployed in next generation video delivery systems capable of increased levels of subscriber activity across multiple devices.
 We have initiated restructuring efforts to improve operations and optimize our cost structure. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we restructured our finance department and terminated the lease to our Waltham, Massachusetts headquarters. In fiscal 2021, we reduced our headcount across all departments in response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in approximately $7.6 million of annualized savings. Additionally, in fiscal 2021, we transferred our technical support services to our Poland location in an effort to further reduce cost.
 In February 2019, we entered into a cooperation agreement (the “Cooperation Agreement”) with TAR Holdings LLC and Karen Singer (collectively, “TAR Holdings”). As of the date of the Cooperation Agreement, TAR Holdings beneficially owned approximately 20.6% of our outstanding common stock. Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, we agreed to set the size of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) at up to eight members, appointed Mr. Robert Pons to the Board as a Class II Director with an initial term that expired at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, and appointed Mr. Jeffrey Tuder to the Board as a Class III Director with an initial term that expired at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. Messrs. Pons and Tuder were subsequently re-elected in the 2019 and 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, respectively. In January 2021, our Chief Executive Officer resigned, and Mr. Pons was subsequently appointed Executive Chairman and Principal Executive Officer in the interim. Mr. Tuder resigned from the Board in May 2021 and was replaced by Mr. David Nicol. In September 2021, Mr. Peter Aquino was appointed as the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Upon the appointment of Mr. Aquino, Mr. Pons resigned as the Company’s Executive Chairman and Principal Executive Officer but remains Chairman of the Board.
 In March 2019, our Board approved and adopted a tax benefits preservation plan (the “Tax Benefits Preservation Plan”) to deter acquisitions of our common stock that would potentially limit our ability to use net operating loss 
 4


carryforwards to reduce our potential future federal income tax obligations. In connection with the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, we declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of our common stock issued and outstanding as of March 15, 2019 to our stockholders of record on that date. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan was approved by our stockholders at our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders.
 In February 2021, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which registered an indeterminate number of shares of common stock, preferred stock, Series A Participating Preferred Stock, warrants or right to purchase common stock or preferred stock, and units using a “shelf” registration or continuous offering process. Under this shelf registration, we may, from time to time, sell any combination of the securities in one or more offerings up to a total aggregate offering price of $200 million. The shelf registration was declared effective on March 16, 2021.
 In connection with the shelf registration statement, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Aegis Capital Corp. on March 30, 2021, to issue and sell 10,323,484 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share (“common stock”), at a public offering price of $1.85 per share (the “Offering”). The Offering closed on April 1, 2021 and resulted in approximately $17.5 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of 6.5%, or $0.12025 per share of common stock, and offering expenses of approximately $0.2 million. In addition to the Offering, the Company also granted the underwriters a 45-day option (the “Underwriter Option”) to purchase up to an additional 1,548,522 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $1.85 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The Underwriter Option was not exercised and has expired.
 In March 2021, we entered into a Sublease Termination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) which terminated the sublease with respect to our former headquarters in Waltham, Massachusetts, effective March 21, 2021. In connection with the early termination of the sublease, the Company paid the sublandlord termination payments of approximately $0.1 million and $0.4 million for the three and six months ended July 31, 2021. The Company also wrote off all related operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities as of the termination date, resulting in a $0.3 million non-cash gain, which partially offset the loss on the termination payments. The net $0.1 million loss on lease termination is reported as a component of severance and restructuring expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022. Prior to the execution of the Termination Agreement, the sublease had been scheduled to expire in February 2025. As a result of the Termination Agreement, we expect annualized savings of approximately $0.6 million in facilities costs for each of the next four years.
 Merger Agreement
 In December 2021, the Company and Triller Hold Co LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Triller”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which Triller will be merged with and into SeaChange, and the separate existence of Triller shall cease, with SeaChange continuing as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”). Upon the closing of the Merger, the name of the combined company (the “Post-Merger Company”) will be changed to “TrillerVerz Corp.”. 
 Pursuant and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, in addition to other contemplated transactions, (i) the parties anticipate that Triller will conduct an offering of convertible notes prior to the closing of the Merger in an amount in excess of $100 million (the “Triller Convertible Notes”), and (ii) the charter of the Post-Merger Company will provide for two classes of common stock, consisting of Class A common stock (“Buyer Class A Common Stock”) and Class B common stock (“Buyer Class B Common Stock”), which Buyer Class B Common Stock is anticipated to provide for super-voting rights to provide its holders 76% or more of the total voting rights.
 The stockholders of SeaChange will have the right to elect to receive either (i) their pro rata portion of $25 million cash consideration along with their pro rata portion of an aggregate $75 million in principal of notes (the “Notes Consideration”) to be issued by the Post-Merger Company to the holders of common stock (such cash and notes consideration, the “Cash/Notes Consideration”) or (ii) a number of shares of Buyer Class A Common Stock (the “Stock Consideration”), in an amount equal to that which such holder would have received if such SeaChange stockholder had purchased the Triller Convertible Notes in an aggregate amount equal to its pro rata portion of the Cash/Notes Consideration and then converted such Triller Convertible Notes at the conversion price at which such Triller Convertible Notes were issued and then participated pro-rata along with the Triller holders in the proposed Merger. Assuming that (i) all holders of SeaChange common stock elect the Stock Consideration and (ii) that Triller issues $250 million of Triller Convertible Notes which convert in connection with the proposed Merger at an agreed 
 5


discount of 20% to an assumed $5 billion Triller valuation, the stockholders of SeaChange would own approximately 2.3% of the Post-Merger Company and the holders of Triller would hold approximately 97.7% of the Post-Merger Company. If all stockholders of SeaChange elected to receive the Cash/Notes Consideration, such stockholders would have no equity interest in the Post-Merger Company, and the Triller holders would collectively own 100% of the Post-Merger Company. For SeaChange stockholders that elect the Cash/Notes Consideration, each would receive their pro rata portion of such Cash/Notes Consideration which would then also reduce the resulting SeaChange stockholders’ ownership percentages by taking into account the payment of the Cash/Notes Consideration and related reduction in the Stock Consideration. The notes (the “Merger Consideration Notes”) to be issued to SeaChange stockholders who elect the Cash/Notes Consideration are payable on the one-year anniversary of issuance, bear interest at a rate of 5% per annum and will be automatically converted into Buyer Class A Common Stock at such time as the market capitalization of the Post-Merger Company equals or exceeds $6.0 billion for ten consecutive trading days. The holders of the Merger Consideration Notes will have the option to convert into Buyer Class A Common Stock if the Post-Merger Company exercises its optional redemption right, which it may do at any time, in whole or in part, on the same terms set forth above. The holders of the Merger Consideration Notes will have recourse against the Post-Merger Company and its assets only to the extent of the Post-Merger Company’s interest in certain of its subsidiaries (who will also provide guarantees of the Merger Consideration Notes). The existing subsidiaries of SeaChange prior to the proposed Merger are also anticipated to provide a first lien security interest on their assets securing the Merger Consideration Notes. The Merger Consideration Notes will have limited covenants.
 Shares of Buyer Class A Common Stock to be issued in the Merger are expected to be listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “ILLR”. No fractional shares of Buyer Class A Common Stock and Buyer Class B Common Stock will be issued in the Merger, and holders of shares of common stock will receive cash in lieu of any such fractional shares. SeaChange stock options and other equity awards will generally, upon completion of the Merger, be converted into Buyer Class A Common Stock.
 The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the closing of the Merger, the board of directors of the Post-Merger Company will be composed of seven members, with all members to be designated by Triller. Upon completion of the Merger, all executive officers of the Post-Merger Company will be appointed by Triller, in each case to serve in such positions until successors are duly elected or appointed.
 The respective boards of directors of SeaChange and Triller have approved the Merger Agreement, and have agreed to recommend that SeaChange’s stockholders and Triller’s unitholders, respectively, adopt the Merger Agreement.
 Neither SeaChange nor Triller is permitted to solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or induce any alternative transaction proposals from third parties or to engage in discussions or negotiations with third parties regarding any alternative transaction proposals. Notwithstanding this limitation, prior to a party’s stockholders or unitholders, as applicable, approving the transactions, including the Merger, such party may under certain circumstances provide information to and participate in discussions or negotiations with third parties with respect to an unsolicited alternative transaction proposal that its board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal. SeaChange’s board of directors may change its recommendation to its stockholders (subject to Triller’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement following such change in recommendation by the SeaChange board of directors) in response to a superior proposal or an intervening event if the board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the exercise of the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law.
 Immediately prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, SeaChange entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, dated as of March 4, 2019 (the “Rights Agreement”), by and between the SeaChange and Computershare Inc., as rights agent. Pursuant to the Amendment, in connection with the Merger Agreement, Triller and its affiliates and associates will not be deemed an “Acquiring Person” under the Rights Agreement.
 PRODUCTS
 Our business is focused on offering video delivery solution sets available as a perpetual license, Software as a Service (“SaaS”), and/or managed services, which can be deployed on-premises and in public and private clouds. Our products provide content and service providers with a complete software delivery platform for linear, VOD and time shift TV over managed and unmanaged networks and include, but are not limited to, the following modules: 
 6


video back-office, media asset management, targeted advertising management, analytics and the client interface for set-top boxes, Smart-TVs and mobile devices. In fiscal 2020 through the first quarter of fiscal 2022, our pricing methodology was focused on selling our products in an all-inclusive bundle (historically called Framework), which included our proprietary software, support services, and sometimes hardware. However, during the current fiscal year, we modified our pricing strategy to make our products available separately from the bundle, or “a la carte”, to better serve our customers’ individual needs. Our revenue sources consist of revenue from licenses and subscriptions, hardware, and related services.
Video Back-Office
 The back-office is a comprehensive software platform that enables content and service providers to manage, monetize and deliver a seamless viewing experience to subscribers across TVs, PCs, tablets, smart phones and other IP-enabled devices. It is a modular software solution allowing customers to gradually adopt new functionality and features to expand multiscreen television distribution capabilities. 
 Media Asset Management 
 In today’s multiscreen viewing environment, programming or advertisements are reproduced with numerous variants to serve the unique requirements of multiple network types, consumer devices and geographies. Metadata, such as poster, description and pricing, associated with the programming, is also managed by the platform. At the point of content ingest, our media asset management software is used to receive, manage and publish video content for viewing on televisions, tablets, PCs and other consumer devices. Our media asset management simplifies the increasingly complex tasks of movie and television program asset tracking, metadata management, and overall content workflow processing.
 Advanced Advertising Platform
 As more video content is served to multiple consumer devices, the ability to generate additional revenue by inserting advertising across multiple platforms becomes crucial to service providers seeking to offset content rights costs and reduce subscriber fees for viewing the content. The advanced advertising platform enables service providers to maximize advertising revenue across multiscreen, broadcast, on-demand and OTT viewing and reach their audiences while viewers watch content across multiple devices. The advanced advertising platform also enables targeted, real time and programmatic advertisement insertion to optimize the revenue generation.
Client Application
 The client application empowers service providers and content owners to optimize live and on-demand video consumption on multiscreen and OTT services. The client application’s features and functionality allow operators to fully leverage the extensive content management, delivery and monetization capabilities of our platforms. The client application products provide a ready-to-deploy multiscreen user experience coupled with a UX Manager cloud service that has been designed to optimize the management of the TV screen’s user experience and customization.
Analytics
 Analytics equips operators with valuable insight into subscriber engagement with their video service in order to optimize retention and monetization. Extensive, pre-built dashboards and reports provide a robust view of VOD catalog engagement, channel lineup utilization, and promotion effectiveness for increased transactional revenues. The benefits of analytic insights include, but are not limited to, identifying at-risk subscribers to incentivize them and reduce the risk of churn, determining effective promotions to increase VOD revenues and catalog productivity, and tracking asset popularity to make accurate business decisions about content providers and VOD price points.
Services
 SeaChange offers comprehensive technical support and maintenance for our projects.  We have developed extensive capabilities in systems integration, implementation and customer engineering.  We also provide managed services capabilities offering end-to-end management of video platform in the cloud, including remote monitoring and proactive system maintenance, to help our customers quickly and confidently establish new on-demand and multiscreen capabilities.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 We have focused and streamlined our research and development efforts in recent years. We believe that our success will depend on our ability to develop and rapidly introduce new integrated solutions and enhancements to our existing products that meet changing customer requirements in our current and future customer base as well as new markets. We have made substantial investments in developing and bringing to market our next generation software products which utilize microservices-based software architectures and advanced orchestration. Our current research and development activities are focused on developing cloud-based multiscreen television platforms, content management solutions, additional user experience applications, advertising solutions and integrating the solutions we currently offer. The majority of our research and development efforts are performed by our engineering and development team in Warsaw, Poland.  
SELLING AND MARKETING 
 Our sales cycle has historically been long, in some instances up to 12-24 months. There are also engagements that span multiple years and it can be difficult to predict in what fiscal period the sale will occur. We primarily utilize a direct sales process and work closely with customers to understand and define their needs. We use several marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of our products. We also market certain features or services to systems integrators and value-added resellers. We attend and exhibit at a limited number of prominent industry trade shows and conferences, when available, and we present our technology at seminars and smaller conferences to promote awareness. 
CUSTOMERS
 We currently sell our products primarily to video service providers, such as cable system operators and telecommunications companies, as well as content providers such as broadcasters, aggregators, and producers. Historically, a significant portion of our revenue in any given fiscal period has been derived from substantial orders placed by these large organizations. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, one customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. 
 We expect that we will continue to be dependent upon a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue in the near future, even as we intend to penetrate new markets and customers. As a result of this customer concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the failure of anticipated orders to materialize and by deferrals or cancellations of orders because of changes in customer requirements or new product announcements or introductions. In addition, the concentration of customers 
 8


may cause variations in revenue, expenses and operating results on a quarterly basis due to seasonality of orders, the timing and relative size of orders received and accepted during a fiscal quarter, or the timing and size of orders for which revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied during a fiscal quarter.
 COMPETITION 
 The markets in which we compete are characterized by intense competition, with many suppliers providing different types of products to different segments of the markets. In new markets for our products, we compete based on price, functionality and delivery capabilities. In markets in which we have an established presence, we compete principally based on the breadth of our products’ features and benefits, including the flexibility, scalability, professional quality, ease of use, reliability and cost effectiveness of our products, and our reputation and the depth of our expertise, customer service and support. While we believe that we currently compete favorably overall with respect to these factors and that our ability to provide integrated solutions to manage and distribute digital video differentiates us from our competitors, in the future we may not be able to continue to compete successfully with respect to these factors. 
 In the market for multiscreen video, we compete with various larger companies offering video platforms and applications such as Synamedia, TiVo, Kaltura, Viaccess-Orca, and MediaKind, as well as in-house solutions built by the service providers. Increasingly, we are also seeing competition from integrated end-to-end solutions and many OTT providers. We expect the competition in each of the markets in which we operate to intensify in the future with existing and new competitors with significant market presence and financial resources.
 Many of our current and prospective competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. Moreover, these companies may introduce additional products that are competitive with ours or enter strategic relationships to offer complete solutions. Therefore, our products may not be able to compete effectively with these products from these companies in the future. 
 PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 Our success and our ability to compete are dependent, in part, upon the proprietary rights of our intellectual property. We currently have 16 patents in the United States (“U.S.”) expiring between 2022 and 2032. In addition, we rely on a combination of contractual rights, trademark laws, trade secrets and copyright laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products. It is possible that the validity of these patents would not be upheld. 
 It is also possible that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be distributed do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Currently, we are not party to intellectual property litigation, but we may be a party to litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or because of an allegation that we infringe others’ intellectual property.
 HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
 Our employees are among our most valuable assets and are critical to our ability to deliver on our strategic plans. Our success in delivering high quality and innovative products and solutions for our customers and driving operational excellence is only achievable through the talent, expertise, and dedication of our global team.
 We recognize that attracting, developing, and retaining skilled talent and promoting a diverse and inclusive culture are essential to maintaining our leadership positions in the markets we serve. We offer employees competitive compensation and benefits, and resources to continuously improve their skills and performance with the goal of further cultivating the diversity and expertise in our global businesses to fill key positions. We seek to hire people who share our values. We value technology and innovation and the achievement of customer-driven success. From our employees, we expect leadership at every level and to act with integrity, fairness, and respect. We invest in talent development and recognize that the growth and development of our employees is essential for our continued success.

As of January 31, 2022, we had 104 employees worldwide, of whom 24 were in our U.S. operations and 80 were in our international operations. In addition, as of January 31, 2022 we had 115 temporary employees and contractors worldwide, many of whom are utilized in the ordinary course of our business. All employees as of January 31, 2022 were full-time employees apart from 3 part-time employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Employees in certain foreign jurisdictions are represented by local works council as may be customary or required in those jurisdictions.
 Total Rewards
 We offer competitive wages, annual bonus opportunities, retirement savings opportunities, including a 401(k) retirement savings plan for U.S. employees, healthcare and insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts, tuition reimbursement, paid time off, and flexible work schedules. 
 Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued to monitor the impact of variants of the virus and the corresponding recommendations from the Center of Disease Control and implement operational changes, as necessary, with the primary objective to provide safety to our employees and to comply with government regulations. We have continued our distributed workforce model, including for some employees, a long-term, full-time work from home arrangement, while implementing additional safety measures for employees and contractors continuing essential and critical on-site work.
