The Company’s predecessor began acquiring hotels in 1976 and organized the Company in 1994.

If the merger is completed, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become a subsidiary of Holding and an indirect subsidiary of LVMH. For further information on the risks relating to the sale of the Company, see Part 1—Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Sale of the Company.

Recent History
On February 23, 2014, the Company (formerly known as Orient-Express Hotels Ltd.) announced that its board of directors had approved a proposal to operate the Company's portfolio of luxury hotels and travel experiences under a new brand name—"Belmond"—from March 10, 2014, and to change its principal internet website address to belmond.com. Belmond has retained its long-term license agreement with SNCF, the French transportation company that owns the "Orient-Express" trademark, for the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train. With the decision to introduce the "Belmond" brand, Belmond also entered into an agreement with SNCF to terminate (with effect from December 31, 2014) the "Orient-Express" license for hotel use, without any cost or penalty. At the 2014 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, shareholders approved a change in Belmond's corporate name from Orient-Express Hotels Ltd. to Belmond Ltd. in order to align Belmond's corporate identity with that of its primary luxury brand. On July 28, 2014, Belmond changed the ticker symbol of its class A common shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange from OEH to BEL.
On March 21, 2014, Belmond entered into a $657,000,000 senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $552,000,000 seven-year term loan and a $105,000,000 five-year, dual-currency revolving credit facility. The term loan comprised a $345,000,000 U.S. dollar-denominated tranche and a €150,000,000 euro-denominated tranche ($207,000,000 as of the completion date). Belmond used the proceeds from the term loan to refinance substantially all of the funded debt of Belmond (other than the debt of Belmond Charleston Place, a consolidated variable interest entity with separate non-recourse financing). On June 2, 2015, Belmond entered into an amendment to its senior secured credit facility to reduce the interest rate on the euro-denominated tranche to EURIBOR plus a 3.00% margin from EURIBOR plus a 3.00% margin. The Company amended and restated its senior secured credit facility on July 3, 2017 to increase the term loan, extend the maturity dates on the revolving credit facility and the term loan to July 3, 2022 and July 3, 2024, respectively, and decrease the interest rates imposed on borrowings. The amended and restated credit agreement consists of a $603,434,000 seven-year term loan and a $100,000,000 five-year, multi-currency revolving credit facility. The term loan consists of a $400,000,000 U.S. dollar-denominated tranche and a €179,000,000 million euro-denominated tranche ($203,434,000 as of the completion date). See Note 12 to the Financial Statements.
In August 2014, Charleston Center LLC entered into an $86,000,000 loan secured on its real and personal property. This loan had no amortization and is non-recourse to Belmond. This loan had an August 2019 maturity and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.12% per annum. In June 2016, Charleston Center LLC refinanced this loan with a $112,000,000 new loan with the same August 2019 maturity. The interest rate on the new loan is LIBOR plus 2.35% per annum, has no amortization and is non-recourse to Belmond. The additional proceeds were used to repay a 1984 development loan from a municipal agency in the principal amount of $10,000,000 and accrued interest of $16,819,000. In connection with the early repayment of the loan, Belmond negotiated a discount that resulted in a net gain, reported in the statements of consolidated operations during the year ended December 31, 2016, of $1,200,000 upon the extinguishment of the debt, including the payment of a tax indemnity to our partners in respect of their allocation of income from the discount arising on the cancellation of indebtedness. See Note 12 to the Financial Statements.
On July 8, 2014, Belmond announced the execution of a management agreement with Cadogan Hotel Partners Limited to operate Belmond Cadogan Hotel, a 64-key hotel in the Knightsbridge area of London, England. The 127-year old hotel closed at the end of July 2014 to undergo a $48,000,000 investment project. The fully renovated and re-conceptualized Belmond Cadogan Hotel opened on February 28, 2019 with refurbished public areas and the reconfiguration reduced to 54 keys in order to accommodate demand from luxury travelers for larger junior suites and suites.

The train was shipped from Australia to Peru and underwent renovations to its interiors to a luxury standard. 
On May 26, 2017, the Company acquired Cap Juluca, a 96-key luxury resort on the Caribbean Island of Anguilla, British West Indies. At the same time, the Company also entered into a 125-year ground lease with the Government of Anguilla for property that comprises approximately 167 acres, including approximately 250,000 square feet of additional developable beachfront land. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements. The resort underwent reconstruction and renovations following its acquisition and the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Jose in September 2017 and opened in December 2018.

On February 8, 2018, the Company acquired Castello di Casole resort and estate, which comprise the 39-key Castello di Casole hotel, together with high-quality vineyards and olive groves, extensive wooded Tuscan countryside, and 48 residential plots, of which 15 remain unsold, with one subject to a binding sale contract, and one subject to a non-binding reservation letter of intent to purchase. It is expected that two of the remaining 13 residential plots will be converted into new villas as part of the hotel inventory. See Note 5 to the Financial Statements.
In recent years, Belmond has sold to third parties a number of properties not considered core to Belmond’s portfolio of unique, high-valued properties. On November 2, 2017, Belmond sold its interest in the entity which wholly owned Belmond Northern Belle, a passenger day train operating in Northern Ireland. On November 6, 2017, the entity that leased Belmond Orcaella provided notice of termination to the owner in respect of its charter agreement, which resulted in a dispute that the parties resolved under a settlement agreement dated January 22, 2019. The owner of Inn at Perry Cabin notified the Company on April 27, 2017 that it was exercising its special right to any early termination of the management agreement under which Belmond was managing the hotel effective as of the end of 2018.

Third parties own a less than 2% minority interest in the hotel.

Belmond Hotel das Cataratas—187 keys—is located beside the famous Iguassu Falls in Brazil on the border with Argentina, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Belmond was awarded in 2007 a 20-year lease of the hotel from the government. It is the only hotel in the national park on the Brazilian side of the falls. First opened in 1958 on about four acres, the hotel has two restaurants, two bars, conference facilities, a swimming pool, spa, fitness center and tennis court, and tropical gardens looking onto the falls. In 2017, the hotel completed the renovation of 23 keys. Belmond had applied in 2009 to the Brazilian Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management for an amendment of the lease, but the Secretary of the Ministry denied the application in September 2014. Belmond thereafter claimed against the Federal Government for breach of the lease and received interlocutory relief at the trial court in the form of a 25% lease reduction and an injunction on the Federal Government from taking any action inconsistent with the court's decision, which was affirmed twice on appeal. The Federal Court subsequently issued a preliminary decision in October 2017 denying in part the Company's claim for modification of the lease concession and ordering the Company to pay the stated rent in the lease, which was affirmed on appeal. On April 25, 2018, the Federal Superior Court reversed the decision in Belmond's favor on all counts, so that the injunction against the Federal Government remains in place and the rent reduction was reinstated on a prospective basis. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings.

Belmond Miraflores Park—89 keys—is located in the fashionable Miraflores residential district of Lima, Peru. This all-suite owned hotel, occupying about an acre of land, faces the Pacific Ocean and is conveniently located to the city's commercial and cultural centers. Following a five-month closure for a $7,500,000 renovation project, Belmond reopened the hotel in April 2014 with refreshed guest accommodations, conference facilities and public areas. The hotel features two restaurants, large banqueting and meeting rooms and an exclusive lounge for guests staying on the upper floors. Leisure facilities include a spa, gym and rooftop swimming pool with ocean views. During 2016, the property converted former office space on its third floor into eight executive guest rooms. In 2018, the Company completed a design for the full renovation of the lobby and the renovation is expected to be completed in 2019. See also Item 3—Legal Proceedings.

Africa

Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel—198 keys—in Cape Town, South Africa is a famous historic property opened in 1899. With beautiful gardens and pools, it stands just below Table Mountain and is within walking distance of the main business, civic and cultural center of the city. The hotel has two restaurants, a ballroom, two swimming pools, tennis courts, a spa and fitness center, and a business center with meeting rooms, all situated on ten acres of owned grounds. In 2012, Belmond renovated 30 guest rooms and the restaurant overlooking the main swimming pool and gardens and, in 2013, refurbished an additional 36 guest rooms. In 2014, Belmond refurbished eight junior suites and 18 suites, including its eight garden cottages. In 2015, the hotel's original ballroom and three conference rooms were renovated and in 2016, 48 keys in the main building were upgraded and refurbished. In 2017, significant upgrades were made to the entry drive, porte cochere, reception lobby, and Tea Lounge and Bar. In 2018, two one-bedroom cottages were converted into a two-bedroom suite. The hotel has expansion potential through conversion of adjacent owned residential properties.

Belmond Khwai River Lodge, Belmond Eagle Island Lodge and Belmond Savute Elephant Lodge—39 keys in total—comprise Belmond’s African safari experience in Botswana consisting of three separate game-viewing lodges. Established in 1971, Belmond holds leases to the lodge sites in the Okavango River delta and nearby game reserves, where African wildlife can be observed from open safari vehicles or boats. The leases expire between 2020 and 2042. Botswana's Okavango Delta was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in June 2014. Each camp has 12 or 15 luxury one bedroom tents under thatched roofs, and guests travel between the camps by light aircraft. Boating, fishing, hiking and swimming are offered at the various sites. In 2015, Belmond closed Belmond Eagle Island Lodge to undertake a full refurbishment of the property and reopened it in November 2015. Belmond Savute Elephant Lodge closed in November 2017 for a full renovation and reopened in May 2018. The renovation 
10

included upgrades to the infrastructure, enhancements to finishes, new food and beverage outlets including outdoor dining, a swimming pool, and the addition of a spa tent.
Asia

Belmond Napasai—68 keys including 14 private villas—is located on its own beach on the north side of Koh Samui island of Thailand in the Gulf of Siam. It originally opened in 2004 and features two restaurants, tennis courts, a swimming pool, a spa and water sports such as sailing, diving and snorkeling in the nearby coral reef. The guest rooms and garden cottages are arranged in sea view on a total site of about 40 owned acres, which includes vacant land for future expansion. The villas, most of which are owned by third parties, are available for rent by hotel guests.

Belmond Jimbaran Puri—64 keys including 22 villas—is on the island of Bali in Indonesia and occupies seven beachfront acres under long-term lease through 2050 on the south coast of the island. Guest rooms are situated in cottages, and there are two restaurants, a spa, swimming pool and ocean water sports. Each villa has its own private plunge pool. 

Ubud Hanging Gardens—38 keys—also on Bali is located on terraces on about seven steep hillside acres above the Ayung River gorge in the rain forest interior of the island. This long-term leased hotel opened in 2005 and offers two restaurants, a swimming pool and spa, and a free shuttle bus to the nearby town of Ubud, a cultural and arts center. Each key has its own private plunge pool.
As previously reported, following an unannounced dispossession of Belmond from Ubud Hanging Gardens by the third-party owner in November 2013, Belmond was unable to continue operating the hotel. Belmond believed this action by the owner was unlawful and in breach of its long-term lease arrangement and constituted a wrongful dispossession. Accordingly, Belmond has taken appropriate legal steps to protect its interests and is currently seeking to enforce its Singapore arbitral award for $8.5 million against the owner in Indonesia. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings.

Belmond La Résidence d’Angkor—59 keys—opened in 2002 and is situated in walled gardens in Siem Reap, Cambodia. The hotel occupies a site of about two acres under long-term lease until 2066. The ancient Temples of Angkor Wat, a UNESCO World Heritage site and the principal tourist attraction in the area, are nearby. The hotel has two indoor/outdoor restaurants, swimming pool, and a spa and fitness center. The property completed a full renovation of its guest rooms and added a pool suite by combining two keys overlooking the pool in 2016. 
Belmond Governor’s Residence—49 keys—was built in the 1920s in the embassy district of Yangon, Myanmar (Burma) originally as the official home of one of the Burmese state governors and near the great Shwedagon pagoda in the city.

The hotel opened in 2001 and occupies about eight hillside acres under long-term lease until 2028. Guest rooms are in four two-story buildings surrounded by lush gardens that include a restaurant, spa and swimming pool.

Part-Owned/Managed Hotels
Peru
Belmond has a 50%/50% joint venture with local investors in Peru which operates the following five hotels under Belmond’s exclusive management.

Belmond Hotel Monasterio—122 keys—is located in the ancient Inca capital of Cusco, an important tourist destination in Peru and a UNESCO World Heritage site. The hotel was originally built as a Spanish monastery in the 16th century, converted to hotel use in 1965, and has been upgraded since then. The guest rooms and two restaurants are arranged around open-air cloisters. Many of the guest rooms are specially oxygenated due to Cusco's high altitude. In 2015, Belmond completed a three-year phased renovation of guest rooms and bathrooms. The site measures approximately three acres under long-term lease until 2047, with options to renew until 2067. In 2018, the design for a soft goods renovation of the lobby bar and two restaurants was completed and construction is expected to commence in the second half of 2019.
Belmond Palacio Nazarenas—55 keys—is located adjacent to Belmond Hotel Monasterio in Cusco and is a former palace and convent which the joint venture has rebuilt as a separate hotel and opened in June 2012. This is an all-suite hotel arranged around courtyards and features oxygenated guest rooms, an outdoor heated swimming pool, spa, and poolside restaurant and bar. During 
11

construction, archeologists discovered Incan artifacts and foundations which have been preserved and displayed in the hotel. The property is subject to a lease until 2035, with options to renew until 2042. In 2018, the joint venture completed an upgrade of its main restaurant.
Belmond Sanctuary Lodge—31 keys—is the only hotel at the famous mountaintop Inca ruins at Machu Picchu, a UNESCO World Heritage site. All of the rooms have been refurbished to a high standard. In 2016, the joint venture completed a three-year phased renovation of all guest rooms and suites, as well as the hotel's reception and public areas. In 2017, the Tinkuy buffet restaurant was refurbished. The joint venture leases the hotel as well as seven acres for possible future expansion at the foot of the ruins, close to the town on the Urubamba River where tourists arrive by train. The lease has been extended to 2025. See Item 3 — Legal Proceedings.
Belmond Hotel Rio Sagrado—23 keys including two villas—is owned by Belmond's Peru hotel joint venture and is located in the Sacred Valley of the Incas between Cusco and Machu Picchu. Opened in 2009, this rustic hotel has a spa with indoor plunge pool and extensive gardens beside the Urubamba River on a site of about six acres set against an imposing mountain backdrop.  The Sacred Valley is a popular part of holiday itineraries in Peru, and a station on Belmond’s PeruRail train service is a short distance from the hotel. During 2013, the joint venture refurbished the guest rooms, enlarged the spa and installed an outdoor heated swimming pool. In 2014, the property enhanced the main entry arrival with a new entry drive and landscape improvements and added a train platform/lounge to accommodate Hiram Bingham train guests stopping at the hotel. In 2015, the joint venture acquired an adjacent parcel of land of approximately two and a half acres on which the joint venture is contemplating further development. 
Belmond Las Casitas—20 keys—is located in Colca Canyon, a river canyon in southern Peru famed for being one of the world's deepest and a habitat for the giant Andean condor and having pre-Inca roots. It is located on a 24 hectare estate with 20 luxury individual bungalows, each with a private terrace, plunge pool, fireplace, indoor and outdoor shower, and hot tub. The resort includes a library, outdoor pool, spa, and restaurant and bar, with an on-property farm that provides organic produce for the restaurant. The Company acquired the property through its 50%/50% joint venture in Peruvian hotels in May 2017 and a soft goods renovation was completed in 2017.
Owned Trains and Cruises

Venice Simplon-Orient-Express comprises 18 historic railway cars, all of which have been refurbished in original 1920s/1930s décor and meet modern safety standards. It operates once or twice weekly principally between multiple cities and Venice from March to November each year via Paris, Zurich and Innsbruck on a scenic route through the Alps. The journey from London to Venice departs from London Victoria station on the Belmond British Pullman train; passengers then cross the English Channel by coach on the Eurotunnel shuttle train. Occasional trips are also made to Vienna, Prague, Berlin, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Budapest and Istanbul. During 2015, the bar was completely refurbished and in 2016 and 2017 respectively, air conditioning and Wi-Fi were added throughout the train. During the 2017/2018 winter closure, one carriage was converted into three grand suites with en-suite showers. Venice-Simplon-Orient-Express is made up of three dining cars, one bar car and sleeper cars carrying up to 178 passengers in 85 double and 12 single cabins. Venice Simplon-Orient-Express is also available for charter by private groups.

Belmond British Pullman consists of 11 Pullman dining cars in Britain which operate from February through December originating out of London on short excursions to places of historic, scenic or sporting interest in southern England, including some weekend trips when passengers stay at local hotels. Full fine dining is offered on every departure. One carriage of the train undergoes interior refurbishment and a full maintenance overhaul annually. 

Belmond Royal Scotsman is a luxury sleeper train owned by Belmond and comprises nine Edwardian-style cars, including five sleeping cars (each compartment with private bathroom), two dining cars and a bar/observation car, and accommodates up to 40 passengers. In 2017, the bar/observation car was renovated and a spa car with two treatment rooms was added. Operating from April to October, the train travels on itineraries of up to seven nights through the Scottish countryside affording passengers the opportunity to visit clan castles, historic battlegrounds, famous Scotch whiskey distilleries and other points of interest. A soft goods renovation of the public areas was completed in 2017. In 2019, a soft refurbishment of all sleeper carriages on the train is expected to be completed.
Belmond Grand Hibernian is a luxury sleeper train owned by Belmond and was launched in 2016 and comprises ten Georgian-styled railway cars, including five sleeping cars (each compartment with a private bathroom), two dining cars, a bar/observation car and accommodates up to 40 passengers. It operates from April to October and travels on three itineraries through the Irish countryside affording passengers the opportunity to visit castles, lakes, towns, whiskey distilleries and other places of interest. 
12

Belmond Road to Mandalay is a luxury river cruise ship on the Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy) River in central Myanmar.  The ship was a Rhine River cruiser built in 1964 that Belmond bought and refurbished. It has 43 air conditioned cabins with private bathrooms, spacious restaurant and lounge areas, and a canopied sun deck with a swimming pool. The ship travels between Mandalay and Bagan up to eight times each month and carries up to 82 passengers who may enjoy sightseeing along the river and guided shore excursions to places of cultural interest. Three- to 11-night itineraries are offered. The ship does not operate in the summer months and occasionally when the water level of the river falls too low due to lack of rainfall. During 2015, the top deck barbeque and bar venues were refurbished.
Belmond Afloat in France consists of seven luxury river and canal boats (called péniche-hôtels) owned by Belmond and operates in Burgundy, Provence and other rural regions of France. They accommodate between four and 12 passengers each in double berth compartments with private bathrooms, and some have small plunge pools on deck.

In 2018, two additional canal boats accommodating eight passengers each were added to the fleet for a total of seven river and canal boats. 
All Belmond trains and cruises are available for private charter.
Part-Owned/Managed Trains
PeruRail: Belmond and local Peruvian investors formed two 50%/50% joint venture companies (PeruRail S.A. ("PeruRail") and Ferrocarril Transandino S.A. ("FTSA")). FTSA was awarded in 1999 a 30-year concession to operate the track and other infrastructure of the state-owned railways in southern and southeastern Peru. The concession had an initial term of 30 years from 1999 with the option to apply for six 5-year extensions. In December 2017, FTSA received a denial of its third extension request. As a result, FTSA can no longer conclude that the remaining three extensions are probable and has therefore reduced its expectation of the total expected life of the concession to the contracted term of 35 years of which 16 years are remaining as of December 31, 2018. This triggered an impairment test of the assets within the joint venture and the shorter time period over which to recover the carrying value of the assets has led to an impairment charge being recorded in the year ended December 31, 2017. The life of the concession is now expected to expire in 2034. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements. 
PeruRail operates passenger and freight services in southern and southeastern Peru. The 70-mile Cusco-Machu Picchu line, carrying mainly tourists as well as local passenger traffic, is the principal means of access to the famous Inca ruins at Machu Picchu because there is no convenient road. Another carrier operates on this line in competition with PeruRail. A second rail line runs from Cusco to Matarani on the Pacific Ocean (via Arequipa) and to Puno on Lake Titicaca, and principally serves freight traffic under contract, an activity PeruRail has expanded by hauling the output of local copper mines in southern Peru to the Pacific port for export. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Segment Performance—Part-owned/managed trains—Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to year ended December 31, 2017 and year ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016. PeruRail can continue to run trains on the track after the conclusion of FTSA's concession. PeruRail, along with other third-party operators, pays a track access fee to FTSA and FTSA pays the Peruvian government fees related to traffic levels and the use of rail infrastructure, locomotives and rolling stock. 
The Cusco-Machu Picchu line connects four of Belmond’s Peruvian hotels, allowing inclusive tours served by the Belmond Hiram Bingham luxury daytime tourist train comprising two dining cars and a bar/observation car with capacity up to 84 passengers. PeruRail also operates a daytime tourist train that runs on the Cusco-Puno route through the High Andes mountains. In 2017, a new luxury sleeper train was launched under the name Belmond Andean Explorer, which runs through the Peruvian Highlands from Cusco to Lake Titicaca and Arequipa. This train consists of 21 carriages, which Belmond owned and operated in Australia until 2003 and sold to PeruRail in 2016. The train was shipped from Australia to Peru where it underwent a full renovation. It carries 70 passengers in 35 en-suite cabins, with two dining cars, a lounge car, and an observation car.

Eastern & Oriental Express: During its operating season from September to April, the Eastern & Oriental Express offers a round trip each week between Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. The journey includes two or three nights on board and side trips to Kuala Kangsar in Malaysia and the River Kwai in Thailand. Some overnight trips are also made from Bangkok to Chiang Mai and elsewhere in Thailand and to Vientiane, Laos. Longer itineraries, up to six nights on board, are offered to places of historic, scenic and cultural interest in the region. Originally built in 1970, the 24 cars were substantially refurbished in an elegant Asian décor and fitted with modern facilities such as air conditioning and private bathrooms. The train is made up of sleeping cars, three restaurant cars, a bar car and an open-air observation car and carries up to 82 passengers. The Eastern & Oriental Express is available for charter by private groups. Belmond manages the train and has a 25% shareholding in the owning company.

Management Strategies

As the foregoing indicates, Belmond has a global mix of luxury hotel and travel products that are geographically diverse and appeal to both high-end individual travelers as well as prominent meeting, incentive, and social groups. Individual travelers in 2018 made up approximately 72% of total hotel room nights, with meeting, social, and incentive groups accounting for the remaining 28%. Belmond’s properties are distinctive as well as luxurious and tend to attract guests prepared to pay higher rates for the travel experiences and high-quality service Belmond offers compared to its competitors.

Belmond benefits from long-term trends and developments favorably impacting the global hotel, travel and leisure markets, including growth trends in the luxury hotel market in many parts of the world, increased travel and leisure spending by consumers, favorable demographic trends in relevant age and income brackets of U.S., European and other populations, and increased online travel bookings. 

Under the Merger Agreement with LVMH, the Company is restricted from taking certain actions without LVMH's consent while the sale to LVMH is pending, including, among others, from making certain investments or acquisitions and selling certain assets, engaging in certain capital expenditures, and incurring certain indebtedness. 
Subject to the constraints imposed by the Merger Agreement, Belmond’s aim is to continue to be the consummate luxury experiential travel company, providing guests with a window into authentic, 'one-of-a-kind' experiences in some of the most inspiring destinations in the world. In 2016, Belmond announced a strategic growth plan intended to grow its business by focusing on three key areas:


• | Driving top-line growth and bottom-line results at the Company's existing businesses -- Belmond plans to continue owning or part-owning and operating most of its existing properties, which allows Belmond to develop each product's distinctive local character and to benefit from current cash flow and potential future gains on sale. Belmond considers its combined owner/operator role as efficient and consistent with the long-term nature of its assets. Self-management or management with equity interest has enabled Belmond to capture the economic benefits otherwise shared with a third-party manager, to control the operations, quality and expansion of the hotels, and to use its experience with market adjustments, price changes, expansions and renovations to improve cash flow and enhance asset values. The Company continues to emphasize increasing revenue and earnings at its established and recently opened properties, with a particular focus on:


◦ | maximizing RevPAR while controlling costs associated with incremental revenue;


◦ | upgrading core systems to drive greater demand, improve customer relationships and increase website conversion ratios;


◦ | investing in capital improvements at existing hotels and expanding where land or space is available, in both cases when potential investment returns are relatively high and operating costs are low;


◦ | putting a greater emphasis on margin improvements; and


◦ | increasing the utilization of its trains and cruises by adding departures and, for PeruRail, expanding its contracted freight business.


• | Continuing the Company's efforts to build brand awareness -- Many of Belmond’s individual properties, such as Belmond Hotel Cipriani, Belmond Grand Hotel Europe, Belmond Copacabana Palace and Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel, have distinctive local character and strong brand identities. Prior to introducing the Belmond brand in 2014, the Company promoted its individual hotel properties and the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train through the “Orient-Express" sub-brand. In 2014, the Company elected to migrate to more of a "hard-brand" strategy and now markets its collection under the Belmond brand. At the same time, the Company retained its long-term license agreement with SNCF, the French transportation company that owns the "Orient-Express" trademark for the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train. With the decision to introduce the Belmond brand, the Company also entered into an agreement with SNCF to terminate (with effect from December 14, 2014) the "Orient-Express" license for hotel use, without any cost or penalty.

The revised brand and marketing strategy is intended to increase consumer recognition of the broad scope of the Company's unique collection of luxury hotels and travel experiences, thereby increasing repeat and multi-property visits and enhancing revenue growth, and to heighten awareness of the entire portfolio of individual properties among existing and potential new guests. Management also expects this approach will make Belmond more attractive to third-party owners thereby facilitating the strategy of expanding into third-party management of properties that complement Belmond's existing portfolio. 
The Company has made important progress on increasing consumer and industry awareness of the Belmond brand in the approximately five years since its launch. Management believes that there is additional scope for expanding awareness 
14

and is focused on building the brand and gaining more market share within the luxury leisure brand landscape. In particular, the Company is focused on making Belmond "the brand of choice" for its specific niche by expanding brand training for employees in order to bring the brand to life for guests while on property, identifying and introducing signature programming that differentiates the Company from its competitors, and utilizing public relations and media opportunities to introduce new experiences while at the same time reinforcing the Belmond brand. In 2017, the Company launched a new global brand campaign and fully re-designed consumer website to support and help centralize these collective brand objectives.

• | Expanding the Company's global footprint -- As part of the strategic plan that the Company unveiled in 2016, Belmond identified global footprint expansion as a meaningful driver of the Company's long-term growth and value. Footprint expansion includes growing the Company's international portfolio through any or all of the following: acquisitions, long-term leases, management agreements -- with or without a related investment, franchise agreements, and construction or acquisition of new train or cruise businesses. Factors in Belmond's evaluation of a potential acquisition, lease, management or franchise opportunity include the property's fit within the Belmond brand and the Company's target geographic markets, as well as an assessment against certain Company's defined financial criteria, with a focus on maintaining conservative debt and leverage levels. In keeping with this conservative approach, the Company intends to partially finance larger acquisitions through the sale of selected assets while generally seeking to retain long-term management of any disposed asset.


As a sizeable part of its footprint expansion strategy, the Company plans to pursue long-term contracts to manage distinctive luxury hotels owned by others principally on a fee basis. These contractual arrangements may include cash, loan or other investment, including key money, by Belmond in connection with renovating or converting a property to meet Belmond's standards and to align Belmond's interest as an operator with the owner. Management agreements are desirable to the Company in that they would typically be a less-capital-intensive manner of facilitating entry into new markets for Belmond. As owner of many unique and luxury properties that Belmond operates itself, Belmond believes it is well positioned to manage comparable hotels for others.


• | Other strategic considerations -- In recent years, management executed on a strategy to reduce Belmond’s long-term debt position. A number of assets not considered key to Belmond’s portfolio of unique, high-valued properties were identified and sold with proceeds being used to reduce debt, re-invest in other properties, and more recently to repurchase the Company's class A common shares. In the last four years, Belmond sold its 50% ownership in the entity which owned Hotel Ritz by Belmond, Madrid, Spain, the Inn at Perry Cabin by Belmond in Maryland, and Belmond Northern Belle in England for combined total proceeds of $87,489,000, and removed any debt or guarantees related to these properties from its consolidated balance sheets. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements. Management continues to review Belmond's portfolio to identify additional non-core assets and expects that any future asset sales would be encumbered by long-term management agreements for Belmond. See Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Marketing, Sales and Public Relations

Belmond invested $3,000,000 in enhanced promotional and marketing initiatives in 2018.

Belmond’s sales and marketing function is primarily based upon direct sales to consumers of travel (prioritizing strategic third-party travel agents, sales representatives and tour operators, and electronic channels such as the internet and digital marketing), cross-selling and up-selling to existing customers, and public relations. Belmond has its own global sales force located in 17 cities in the U.S., Brazil, Mexico, various European countries, Australia and Japan, and has appointed third-party sales representatives in ten additional cities in Asia and the Middle East. Belmond also has local sales staff responsible for the properties where they are based.

Belmond’s sales staff identify and train preferred travel industry and distribution partners, engage with group and corporate account representatives, and conduct marketing initiatives such as direct mailings, e-commerce, trade show participation and event sponsorship. Revenue is managed using sophisticated room rate and inventory tools. Belmond participates in a number of luxury travel partner programs, such as the “Fine Hotels & Resorts" and "Centurion Hotel Program", both operated by American Express, and the “Virtuoso” travel agent consortium. Belmond offers its top travel agents and other industry partners "by invitation only" participation in Belmond’s “Bellini Club” providing training courses, special commissions and sales support for all Belmond products worldwide.

Consumer advertising, websites and digital marketing are important direct sales and marketing tools for Belmond. Through its principal website (belmond.com), Belmond provides extensive descriptions and images of the products and guest activities in 
15

English and seven other languages, in addition to bookings and brand wide promotions. The belmond.com website was fully rebuilt and re-branded in 2017, in anticipation of the launch of a global brand campaign and to support the business objective to increase bookings and revenues through online commerce. Belmond operates other internet special interest travel portals that direct customers to Belmond’s properties, and works with other selected electronic distribution channels.  Social media such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Pinterest are increasingly significant marketing tools, particularly as the brand looks to reach new markets and to target new customer demographics, including millennials.

Because repeat customers appreciate the consistent quality of Belmond’s hotels, trains and cruises, an important part of Belmond’s strategy is to promote Belmond properties through various cross-selling efforts to engage with Belmond's loyal customer base. These include gifts cards, customer relationship management systems and other customer recognition programs, worldwide preferred travel agent programs, and direct communications with customers. In 2019, the Company will continue to invest in the roll-out of a business intelligence system to further enhance the effectiveness of its marketing and communication strategy to ensure content is tailored, targeted and personalized in accordance with individual customer preferences.

Belmond’s marketing strategy also focuses on public relations, which management believes is a highly cost-effective marketing tool for luxury properties. Because of the unique nature of Belmond’s portfolio, guests often hear about Belmond’s hotels and other travel products through word-of-mouth or published articles. Belmond has an in-house public relations office in London and representatives in 14 countries worldwide, including third-party public relations firms under contract, to promote its properties through targeted newspapers, general interest and travel magazines, and broadcast, online and other media.
Corporate Social Responsibility

Belmond is committed to the implementation of responsible business practices furthering the sustainability of tourism and seeks to ensure that its properties and corporate offices engage with their local communities and environments in a positive manner through their ongoing activities. Examples of these are as follows:

• | Belmond is a member of the Sustainable Restaurant Association and will continue to be advised by its food sustainability, environmental responsibility and ethical sourcing standards during the coming year. In addition, the food and beverage operations of Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons will continue to be fully assessed in 2019 to measure and benchmark sustainability credentials. The UK hotel continues to support the local community, source local food wherever possible, and compost waste.


• | In Myanmar, the ship doctor of Belmond Road to Mandalay has run community activities along the Ayeyarwady River in a program dating back to 1995. These include a free clinic that treats an average of 2,000 people per month. Among other community activities are the construction and long-term support of 25 schools, and irrigation and solar power projects in remote villages.


• | Our diverse activities in southeast Asia include supporting a turtle conservation foundation, beach cleaning, and agricultural, water purification and recycling programs in Bali. We support an orphanage in Laos, train students of a hospitality school in Cambodia and recycle retired linens to those in need near several of our hotels. Belmond Napasi in Koh Samui has received a Silver G-Green Award from Thailand's Department of Environmental Quality & Promotion.


• | In Russia, Belmond Grand Hotel Europe works with local orphanages and youth organizations to support those in need. The hotel supports a house in the SOS children's village outside of St. Petersburg for young people without families, where five children aged between 12 and 15 years old are currently being cared for. The hotel has also introduced a greenhouse program to educate children in growing, and the importance of fresh organic vegetables.


• | In the U.S., Belmond Charleston Place created and coordinates the Charleston Chefs’ “Feed the Need” Program in which local hotels, restaurants and caterers provide weekly meals in food shelters for up to 500 persons. The hotel also introduced a "Teach the Need" program, teaching hospitality skills to at-risk high school students and helping them find employment. A new program, "Ben's Friends," helps those in the hospitality industry overcome drug- and alcohol-related problems.

Competition

17

Some of Belmond’s properties are located in areas with numerous competitors. Competition for guests in the hospitality industry is based generally on reputation and name recognition, the convenience of location, the quality of the property and services offered, room rates and menu prices, the range and quality of food services and amenities offered, and types of cuisine.

Belmond’s strategy is to acquire, invest or manage only hotels which have special locations and distinctive character, offering unique travel experiences. Many are in areas with interesting local history or high entry barriers because of zoning restrictions.  Belmond builds its competitive advantage by offering high quality service and cuisine, usually with a local flavor. Typically, therefore, Belmond competes by providing a special combination of location, character, cuisine, service and experiential activities rather than relying on price competition.

Belmond’s luxury tourist trains have no direct competitors at present. Other passenger trains operate on the same or similar routes, including the Cusco-Machu Picchu line of PeruRail, but management believes Belmond’s trains and onboard service are unique and of such superior quality that guests consider a Belmond train journey more of a luxury experience and an end in itself than merely a means of transport. 

Employees

Belmond currently employs approximately 9,300 full-time-equivalent persons.  Approximately 6,450 persons are employed in the hotels, 2,700 in the trains and cruises business, and 130 in central administration, sales and marketing and other activities.  Management believes that Belmond’s ongoing labor relations are satisfactory. Through its various training and other human resources programs, Belmond seeks to attract, develop and retain top employees providing authentic local experiences to guests and to promote internal candidates for leadership positions.
Government Regulation

Belmond and its properties are subject to numerous laws and government regulations such as those relating to the preparation and sale of food and beverages, liquor service, health and safety of premises and employees, development and construction, customer and employee data privacy, employee relationships and welfare, environmental matters, waste and hazardous substance handling and disposal, and planning and zoning rules.
