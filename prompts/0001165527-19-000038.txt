ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
 
We were formerly known as Eight Dragons Company, a Nevada corporation. Our predecessor was incorporated in Delaware on September 27, 1996 and on October 24, 2007 changed its state of incorporation from Delaware to Nevada by means of a merger with and into Eight Dragons Company. On March 23, 2018, we changed our name to Rokk3r Inc. (“we”, the “Company” or “Rokk3r”) in connection with this name change, and on June 18, 2018, our trading symbol was changed to “ROKK.”
 
We expect to generate revenues primarily from consulting services agreements focused on education, development and growth. Our agreements are individually negotiated and are meant to help entrepreneurs and business professionals to innovate and create high growth companies through training, mentors, and access to our global network of advisors, investors and business builders. Through our consulting services agreements, we provide "Think", "Co-build", and “Scale” brand services. We execute "Think Phases" for entrepreneurs and corporations, where we present an experienced team with a problem for four weeks to validate the ideas and refine their strategy. In “Co-build,” our team of strategists, creatives, and engineers seek to solve problems, understand our client’s business and develop a foundation for a technological platform to drive it. For growth, we work with entrepreneurs to help them define financial and growth objectives to develop short, medium and long-term strategies, a service offering we call "Scale."
 
Our Services and the Rokk3r Ecosystem
 
We provide a suite of services that is a hybrid network of human and machine intelligence systems, seeking to enable early stage startup technology companies and existing businesses to develop new products and businesses in a frictionless, accelerated and comprehensive way.  Our services are designed to leverage exponential technologies to rapidly accelerate and shape industries. These exponential technologies include artificial intelligence (AI), augmented and virtual reality (AR, VR), blockchain (decentralized ledger technologies), data science, digital biology and biotech, machine learning, nanotech, robotics and sensors. By taking into account modern economic theories (abundance), exponential organizations (ExOs) factors, exponential technologies, increased global connectivity, and the rise of a collective global genius, we seek to optimize rates of success in company building and product development by offering a broader range of essential services in one place. We provide these services with the purpose of allowing our clients to focus on the creative aspects of building a business or creating new products and relieve them with the burden of developing an operational and development infrastructure.
 
Our ecosystem approach aims to reduce friction and streamline execution by leveraging talent, shared services, experience, and networks. From business diagnosis to strategy design, execution and funding, Rokk3r helps organizations and ventures augment and transform exponentially. Through our methodology and ecosystem, we seek to make new business opportunities become highly investable assets for venture fund and other investment funds.
 
Our Market
 
A rise in the number of people connected to the internet from 3 billion to 6 billion over the next 5 to 10 years is projected to lead to trillions of dollars of online commerce. These increases have led to a new breed of visionaries, designers, developers and creators who are seeking to leverage exponential technologies to build companies who develop new software applications, products and business solutions to address global needs.
 
We believe that the solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges lie in the intersection of exponential technologies. That is, when two or more of these technologies are used in combination to attack a persistent challenge, the possibility of developing a sustainable solution becomes much more likely.
 
For example, consider a potential healthcare solution that leverages machine learning, public health records, and individual genetic profiles to help prevent heart disease. Or, consider another solution that might use personal health records, a new biosensor, and the data from smartphones to predict the presence of cancer. These are the types of solutions we are trying to enable through the innovation and learning platform we provide.
 
      Furthermore, it is well known that a high percentage of entrepreneurs fail, forreasons rangingfrom their inability to find product market fit, to not being able to recruit the appropriate talent to not receiving funding at the right time. We believe that the infrastructure for entrepreneurs who seek to develop new technologies does not match up with the demand for new applications. Yesteryear solutions of leveraging close contacts to get work done and raising funds from family and friends when it really matters is not always effective. Even in today’s hyper-connected world, we believe innovation is hampered by where you are, the lack of access to investors, mentors, technology resources and access to the global economy. We believe these limitations create a need for an infrastructure and ecosystem that provides an overall, global entrepreneurial solution. A limitation addressed by our Rokk3r Ecosystem.  4
 
As a result, several clients have joined our ecosystem in 2018, such as Corporacion El Rosado, SBD Scala, Seguros Confianza, Zingo Inc., Fleetflex Inc., Joule.Ai Inc., and Sostereo Music Group LLC.El Rosado and SBD Scala were two of the major clients of the company in 2018 and the contract with SBD was completed at the end of the 2018. The Company’s continuous business development efforts is expected to result in new business opportunities and reduce reliance on major clients.
 Our Marketing Efforts and Plans
 
Our goal is to make it possible for anyone, anywhere, to participate in our public-market based, blockchain-driven, exponential company building ecosystem. We plan to unlock the process of company building and have been actively marketing our advisory services in the U.S., Latin America and the U.K. to meet the needs of this market. We expect to add new consulting clients through these enhanced marketing efforts coupled with increasing demand from U.S. based technology companies seeking our services. We will continue to focus our efforts on companies that utilize technology in their software applications, business process or products that fulfill a need in daily living. We believe these companies have the greatest potential for growth and profitability and are in need of business development services and capital.
 
Our marketing efforts include sponsoring trade symposiums, investment forums, formation of strategic alliances with industry and trade associations and educational institutions and our presence on the Internet. Rokk3r Talk is a special series of one-day talks that aims to bring our community together, including potential entrepreneurs, investors, and corporations entering our ecosystem. Rokk3r Talk’s speakers are subject matter experts and share their views on topics such as the impact of exponential technologies, the rise of new industries, technology trends, the global economy and how entrepreneurs and companies are taking advantage of the new paradigms to transform business insights into exponential opportunities. The Rokk3r Ambassador program consists of a network of passionate people from various communities that contribute to our mission by amplifying our impact and bringing entrepreneurs, investors, and corporations into our exponential transformation ecosystem via a formalized incentive structure. Rokk3r ambassadors are deployed across strategic markets helping Rokk3r expand its reach.
 
Competition
 
The services we offer compete with the services offered by entities and individuals seeking to take advantage of the growing need of companies seeking management advice in order to develop new products and technologies and obtain access to U.S. capital markets for their expansion. This competition ranges from large management consulting firms and investment banks that offer a broad range of consulting and financial services, to small companies and independent contractors that provide specialized services. Many of the firms prospecting these clients are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Furthermore, we acknowledge we are competing with firms that may possess greater financial, marketing, technical, human and other resources. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to offer a wider range of value-added services than our competitors. In light of the sheer numbers of companies and individuals seeking to expand or develop new products and technologies, we believe it is difficult for early stage companies to convert ideas into products or businesses, attract interest in the financial community, make acquisitions and increase revenues and profitability. In that sense, our main competitors are Accenture Inc., Boston Consulting Group (BCG), PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), McKinsey & Company, local innovation agents, such as Singularity University, and Mach49; and start-up incubators and accelerators. However, we believe the Company is well positioned to assist early stage companies.
Government Regulation
 
We believe we are in substantial compliance with all governmental regulations applicable to our business. We will employ a number of external resources to assist us in complying with our regulatory obligations. These external resources will include outside technology providers and consultants. As we expand our business, we will be required to raise additional capital to cover the expected increase in costs to hire and train additional internal and external resources to ensure we remain in substantial compliance with our governmental obligations.
Patents and Trademarks
 We do not own any patents or trademarks. On November 15, 2018, the Company entered into a Trademark License Agreement with Rokk3r Labs.Pursuant to which,Rokk3r Labs granted the Company and its subsidiaries, a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, license to use the trademark ROKK3R in word form and in all style and design variations used to date by Rokk3r Labs or its authorized licensees, until November 12, 2019. The agreement may automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless terminated by either party. If a party elects not to renew the agreement, that party shall provide a notice of that intention to the other party at least 30 days prior to the renewal date. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company shall pay an annual fee of $120,000, payable on the anniversary of the effective date of the agreement.
Employees
 
As of March 22, 2019, we have five (5) full-time employees. However, our controlling shareholder, Rokk3r Labs, provides us with the services of its contractors and third-party software developers on an as-needed basis pursuant to a Collaboration Agreement. See Item 13.
 
Since the incorporation of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary Rokk3r Ops Inc., a portion of the services have been assumed and are now being offered by Rokk3r Ops’ independent contractors.
