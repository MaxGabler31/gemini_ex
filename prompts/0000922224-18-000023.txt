ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General

(All Registrants)

PPL Corporation, headquartered in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is a utility holding company, incorporated in 1994, in connection with the deregulation of electricity generation in Pennsylvania, to serve as the parent company to the regulated utility, PPL Electric, and to generation and other unregulated business activities. PPL Electric was founded in 1920 as Pennsylvania Power & Light Company. PPL, through its regulated utility subsidiaries, delivers electricity to customers in the U.K., Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee; delivers natural gas to customers in Kentucky; and generates electricity from power plants in Kentucky. In June 2015, PPL completed the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, which combined its competitive power generation businesses with those of Riverstone to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named Talen Energy. See "Spinoff of PPL Energy Supply" below for more information.

PPL's principal subsidiaries at December 31, 2017 are shown below (* denotes a Registrant).

Segment Information

(PPL)

PPL is organized into three reportable segments as depicted in the chart above: U.K. Regulated, Kentucky Regulated, and Pennsylvania Regulated. The U.K. Regulated segment has no related subsidiary Registrants. PPL's other reportable segments' results primarily represent the results of its related subsidiary Registrants, except that the reportable segments are also allocated certain corporate level financing and other costs that are not included in the results of the applicable subsidiary Registrants. PPL also has corporate and other costs which primarily include financing costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, as well as certain other unallocated costs. As a result of the June 1, 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, PPL no longer has a Supply segment. The operations of the Supply segment are included in "Loss from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes)" on the Statements of Income.
A comparison of PPL's three regulated segments is shown below.

(PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU)

PPL Electric has two operating segments that are aggregated into a single reportable segment. LKE, LG&E and KU are individually single operating and reportable segments.

• | U.K. Regulated Segment (PPL)

Consists of PPL Global, which primarily includes WPD's regulated electricity distribution operations, the results of hedging the translation of WPD's earnings from British pound sterling into U.S. dollars, and certain costs, such as U.S. income taxes, administrative costs and acquisition-related financing costs.

WPD operates four of the 14 Ofgem regulated DNOs providing electricity service in the U.K. through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries: WPD (South West), WPD (South Wales), WPD (East Midlands) and WPD (West Midlands). The number of network customers (end-users) served by WPD totals 7.9 million across 21,600 square miles in south Wales and southwest and central England.

Revenues, in millions, for the years ended December 31 are shown below. 

 | 2017 | | 2016 | 2015
Operating Revenues (a) | $ | 2,091 | | $ | 2,207 | $ | 2,410


(a) | WPD’s Operating Revenues are translated from GBP to U.S. dollars using the average GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rates in effect each month. The annual weighted average of the monthly GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rates used for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $1.28 per GBP, $1.37 per GBP and $1.53 per GBP.

Franchise and Licenses
WPD’s operations are regulated by Ofgem under the direction of the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority. Ofgem is a non-ministerial government department and an independent National Regulatory Authority that is responsible for protecting the interests of existing and future electricity and natural gas consumers. The Electricity Act 1989 provides the fundamental framework for electricity companies and established licenses that require each of the DNOs to develop, maintain and operate efficient distribution networks. WPD’s operations are regulated under these licenses which set the outputs WPD needs to deliver for their customers and associated revenues WPD is allowed to earn. WPD operates under a regulatory year that begins April 1 and ends March 31 of each year.
Ofgem has the formal power to propose modifications to each distribution license; however licensees can appeal such changes to the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority in the event of a disagreement with the regulator. Generally, any potential changes to these licenses are reviewed with stakeholders in a formal regulatory consultation process prior to a formal change proposal.
Competition
Although WPD operates in non-exclusive concession areas in the U.K., it currently faces little competition with respect to end-users connected to its network. WPD's four distribution businesses are, therefore, regulated monopolies, which operate under regulatory price controls.
Customers

WPD provides regulated electricity distribution services to licensed third party energy suppliers who use WPD's networks to transfer electricity to their customers, the end-users. WPD bills energy suppliers for this service and the supplier is responsible for billing its end-users. Ofgem requires that all licensed electricity distributors and suppliers become parties to the Distribution Connection and Use of System Agreement. This agreement specifies how creditworthiness will be determined and, as a result, whether the supplier needs to collateralize its payment obligations.
WPD’s costs make up approximately 16% of a U.K. end-user customer’s electricity bill. 
U.K. Regulation and Rates
Overview
Ofgem has adopted a price control regulatory framework with a balanced objective of enhancing and developing electricity networks for the future, controlling costs to customers and allowing DNOs, such as WPD's DNOs, to earn a fair return on their investments. This regulatory structure is focused on outputs and performance in contrast to traditional U.S. utility ratemaking that operates under a cost recovery model. Price controls are established based on long-term business plans developed by each DNO with substantial input from its stakeholders. To measure the outputs and performance, each DNO business plan includes incentive targets that allow for increases and/or reductions in revenues based on operational performance, which are intended to align returns with quality of service, innovation and customer satisfaction. 
For comparative purposes, amounts listed below are in British pounds sterling, nominal prices and in calendar years unless otherwise noted.

Key Ratemaking Mechanisms
PPL believes the U.K. electricity utility model is a premium jurisdiction in which to do business due to its significant stakeholder engagement, incentive-based structure and high-quality ratemaking mechanisms.
Current Price Control: RIIO-ED1
WPD is currently operating under an eight-year price control period called RIIO-ED1, which commenced for electricity distribution companies on April 1, 2015. The regulatory framework is based on an updated approach for sustainable network regulation known as the "RIIO" model where Revenue = Incentives + Innovation + Outputs. 
The RIIO framework allows for a MPR, which is a review halfway through the price control period to assess potential changes in outputs during the price control period. The scope of the potential MPR was originally limited to material changes to outputs that can be justified by clear changes in government policy and the introduction of new outputs that are needed to meet the needs of consumers and other network users. Ofgem is currently consulting on the scope of the potential MPR. See "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview - Financial and Operational Developments - Regulatory Requirements" for additional information.
In coordination with numerous stakeholders, WPD developed its business plans for RIIO-ED1 building off its historical track record and long-term strategy of delivering industry-leading levels of performance at an efficient level of cost. As a result, all four of WPD’s DNOs' business plans were accepted by Ofgem as "well justified" and were "fast-tracked" ahead of all of the other DNOs. WPD's DNOs were rewarded for being fast-tracked with preferential financial incentives, a higher return on equity and higher cost savings retention under their business plans as discussed further below.
WPD's combined RIIO-ED1 business plans include funding for total expenditures of approximately £12.8 billion (nominal) over the eight-year period, broken down as follows:

• | Totex - £8.5 billion (£6.8 billion recovered as additions to RAV over time ("Slow pot"); £1.7 billion recovered in the year spent in the plan ("Fast pot"));


• | Pension deficit funding - £1.2 billion;


• | Cost of debt recovery - £1.0 billion;


• | Pass Through Charges - £1.6 billion (Property taxes, Ofgem fees and National Grid transmissions charges); and


• | Corporate income taxes recovery - £0.5 billion.

The chart below illustrates the building blocks of allowed revenue and GAAP net income for the U.K. Regulated Segment. The revenue components are shown in either 2012/13 prices or nominal prices, consistent with the formulas Ofgem established for RIIO-ED1. The reference numbers included in each block correspond with the descriptions that follow.

(a) | Primarily pension deficit funding, pass through costs, profiling adjustments and legacy price control adjustments.


(b) | Primarily pass through true-ups and £5 per residential customer reduction.

(d) | Includes GAAP pension costs/income (see “Defined Benefits, Net periodic defined benefit costs (credits)” in Note 11 to the Financial Statements).


(e) | Primarily property taxes.


(f) | Primarily gains and losses on foreign currency hedges.

(h) | GAAP income taxes represent an effective tax rate of 19% for 2017, 16% for 2016 and approximately 17% going forward.

(1) Base Revenue
The base revenue that a DNO can collect in each year of the current price control period is the sum of the following which are discussed further below:

• | a return on capital from RAV;


• | a return of capital from RAV (i.e., depreciation);


• | the Fast pot recovery, see discussion “(4) Expenditure efficiency mechanisms” below;


• | an allowance for cash taxes paid less a potential reduction for tax benefits from excess leverage if a DNO is levered more than 65% Debt/RAV;


• | pension deficit funding


• | certain pass-through costs over which the DNO has no control;


• | profiling adjustments, see discussion “(6) Other revenue included in base revenue” below;


• | certain legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods, including the information quality incentive (also known as the rolling RAV incentive); and


• | fast-track incentive - because WPD's four DNOs were fast-tracked through the price control review process for RIIO-ED1, their base demand revenue also includes the fast-track incentive.

(2) Real Return on capital from RAV
Real-time returns on cost of regulated equity (real) - Ofgem establishes an allowed return on regulated equity that DNOs earn in their base business plan revenues as a consideration of the financial parameters for each RIIO-ED1 business plan. For WPD, the base cost of equity collected in revenues was set at 6.4% (real). Base equity returns exclude inflation adjustments, allowances for incentive rewards/penalties and over/under collections driven by cost efficiencies. WPD’s base equity returns are calculated using an equity ratio of 35% of RAV at the DNO. The equity ratio was reviewed and set during the RIIO-ED1 business plan process taking various stakeholder impacts into consideration such as costs to consumers, credit ratings and investor needs. The amounts of base real equity return, for 2017 and 2016 were £151 million and £144 million.
Indexed cost of debt recovery (real) - As part of WPD’s fast-track agreement with Ofgem for RIIO-ED1, WPD collects in revenues an assumed real cost of debt that is derived from a historical 10-year bond index (iBoxx) and adjusted annually for inflation. This calculated real cost of debt is then applied to 65% of RAV at the DNOs to determine the cost of debt revenue recovery. The cost of debt was set at 2.55% in the original "well justified" business plans. The recovery amounts are trued up annually as a component of the MOD true-up mechanism described within "(9) MOD and Inflation True-Up (TRU)" below. 
Actual interest expense is reflective of prior financing activities and any financing required to fund capital expenditures. Therefore, the amount collected in revenues may differ from the actual interest expense recorded in the Statements of Income. Currently, WPD is under-recovering its DNO-related interest expense and is expected to continue to under-recover through the remainder of RIIO-ED1.
Interest costs relating to debt issued at WPD’s holding companies are not recovered in revenues and for 2017 and 2016 were approximately £49 million and £54 million.
(3) Recovery of depreciation in revenues - Recovery of depreciation in regulatory revenues is one of the key mechanisms Ofgem uses to support financeable business plans that provide incentives to attract the continued substantial investment required in the U.K. Differences between GAAP and regulatory depreciation exist primarily due to differing assumptions on asset lives and because RAV is adjusted for inflation using RPI.
Compared to asset lives established for GAAP, asset lives established for ratemaking are set by Ofgem based on economic lives which results in improved near-term revenues and cash flows for DNOs during investment cycles. Under U.K. regulation prior to RIIO-ED1, electric distribution assets were depreciated on a 20-year asset life for the purpose of setting revenues. After review and consultation, Ofgem decided to use 45-year asset lives for RAV additions after April 1, 2015, with transitional arrangements available for DNOs that fully demonstrated a need to ensure a financeable plan. WPD adopted a transition that 
7

has a linear increase in asset lives from 20 to 45 years for additions to RAV in each year of RIIO-ED1 (with additions averaging a life of approximately 35 years over this period), which adds support to its credit metrics. RAV additions prior to March 31, 2015 continue to be recovered in revenues over 20 years.
The asset lives used to determine depreciation expense for GAAP purposes are not the same as those used for the depreciation of the RAV in setting revenues and, as such, vary by asset type and are based on the expected useful lives of the assets. Effective January 1, 2015 after completing a review of the useful lives of its distribution network assets, WPD set the weighted average useful lives to 69 years for GAAP depreciation expense. 
Because Ofgem uses a real cost of capital, the RAV and recovery of depreciation are adjusted for inflation using RPI. The inflation revenues collected in this line item help recover the cost of equity and debt returns on a "nominal" basis, compared to the "real" rates used to set the return component of base revenues. 
This regulatory construct, in combination with the different assets lives used for ratemaking and GAAP, results in amounts collected by WPD as recovery of depreciation in revenues being significantly higher than the amounts WPD recorded for depreciation expense under GAAP. For 2017 and 2016, this difference was £424 million and £415 million (pre-tax) and positively impacted net income. We expect this difference to continue in the £400 million to £450 million (pre-tax) range at least through 2022 (the last full calendar year of RIIO-ED1) assuming RPI of approximately 3.0% per year from 2018 through 2022 and based on expected RAV additions of approximately £800 million per year to prepare the distribution system for future U.K. energy objectives while maintaining premier levels of reliability and customer service. 
(4) Expenditure efficiency mechanisms - Ofgem introduced the concept of Totex in RIIO to ensure all DNOs face equal incentives in choosing between operating and capital solutions. Totex is split between immediate recovery (called "Fast pot") and deferred recovery as an addition to the RAV (called "Slow pot"). The ratio of Slow pot to Fast pot was determined by each DNO in their business plan development. WPD established a Totex split of 80% Slow pot and 20% Fast pot for RIIO-ED1 to balance maximizing RAV growth with immediate cost recovery to support investment grade credit ratings. Comparatively, other DNOs on average used a ratio of approximately 70% Slow pot and 30% Fast pot for RIIO-ED1. 
Ofgem also allows a Totex Incentive Mechanism that is intended to reward DNOs for cost efficiency. WPD's DNOs are able to retain 70% of any amounts not spent against its RIIO-ED1 plan and bear 70% of any over-spends. Any amounts to be returned to customers are trued up in the AIP discussed below. 
Because Fast pot cost recovery represents 20% of Totex expenditures and certain other costs are recovered in other aspects of revenue, Fast pot will not equal operation and maintenance expenses recorded for GAAP purposes. 
(5) Income Tax Allowance - For price control purposes, WPD collects income tax based on Ofgem’s notional tax charge, which will not equal the amount of income tax expense recorded for GAAP purposes. The following table shows the amount of taxes collected in revenues and recorded under GAAP.

 | 2017 | | 2016
Taxes collected in revenues | £ | 57 | | | £ | 53
Taxes recorded under GAAP | 139 | | | 119 | 

(6) Other revenue included in base revenue - Other revenue included in base revenue primarily consists of pension deficit funding, pass through costs, profiling adjustments and legacy price control adjustments.
Recovery of annual (normal) pension cost and pension deficit funding - Ofgem allows DNOs to recover annual (normal) pension costs through the Totex allocation, split between the previously described Fast pot (immediate recovery) and Slow pot recovery (as an addition to RAV). The amount of normal pension cost is computed by the pension trustees, using assumptions that differ from those used in calculating pension costs/income under GAAP. In addition, the timing of the revenue collection may not match the actual pension payment schedule, resulting in a timing difference of cash flows. 
In addition, WPD recovers approximately 80% of pension deficit funding for certain of WPD's defined benefit pension plans in conjunction with actual costs similar to the Fast pot mechanism. The pension deficit is determined by the pension trustees on a triennial basis in accordance with their funding requirements. Pension deficit funding recovered in revenues was £142 million and £139 million in 2017 and 2016.
See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for additional information on pension costs/income recognized under GAAP.
8

Recovery of pass through costs - WPD recovers certain pass-through costs over which the DNO has no control such as property taxes, National Grid transmission charges and Ofgem fees. Although these items are intended to be pass-through charges there could be timing differences, primarily related to property taxes, as to when amounts are collected in revenues and when amounts are expensed in the Statements of Income. WPD over-collected property taxes by £19 million and £8 million in 2017 and 2016. WPD expects to continue to over-recover property taxes until the end of RIIO-ED1. Amounts under-or over-recovered in revenues in a regulatory year are trued up through revenues two regulatory years later.
Profiling adjustments - Ofgem permitted DNOs the flexibility to make profiling adjustments to their base revenues within their business plans. These adjustments do not affect the total base revenue in real terms over the eight-year price control period, but change the year in which the revenue is collected. In the first year of RIIO-ED1, WPD’s base revenue decreased by 11.8% compared to the final year of the prior price control period (DPCR5), primarily due to a change in profiling methodology and a lower weighted-average cost of capital. Base revenue then increases by approximately 2.5% per annum before inflation for regulatory years up to March 31, 2018 and by approximately 1% per annum before inflation for each regulatory year thereafter for the remainder of RIIO-ED1. 
(7) Incentives for developing high-quality business plans (known as fast-tracking) - For RIIO-ED1, Ofgem incentivized DNOs with certain financial rewards to develop "well justified" business plans that drive value to customers. WPD was awarded the following incentives for being fast-tracked by Ofgem: 

• | an annual fast-track revenue incentive worth 2.5% of Totex (approximately £25 million annually for WPD);


• | a real cost of equity rate of 6.4% compared to 6.0% for slow-tracked DNOs; and,


• | cost savings retention was established at 70% for WPD compared to approximately 55% for slow-tracked DNOs.

(8) Allowed Revenue - Allowed revenue is the amount that a DNO can collect from its customers in order to fund its investment requirements. 
Base revenues are adjusted annually during RIIO-ED1 to arrive at allowed revenues. These adjustments are discussed in sections (9) through (13) below.
(9) MOD and Inflation True-Up (TRU)

MOD - RIIO-ED1 includes an AIP that allows future base revenues, agreed with the regulator as part of the price control review, to be updated during the price control period for financial adjustments including taxes, pensions, cost of debt, legacy price control adjustments from preceding price control periods and adjustments relating to actual and allowed total expenditure together with the Totex Incentive Mechanism (TIM). The AIP calculates an incremental change to base revenue, known as the "MOD" adjustment. 

• | The MOD provided by Ofgem in November 2016 included the TIM for the 2015/16 regulatory year, as well as the cost of debt calculation based on the 10-year trailing average to October 2016. This MOD of £12 million reduced base revenue in calendar years 2017 and 2018 by £8 million and £4 million.


• | The MOD provided by Ofgem in November 2017 for the 2016/17 regulatory year is a £39 million reduction to revenue and will reduce base revenue in calendar years 2018 and 2019 by £26 million and £13 million.


• | The projected MOD for the 2017/18 regulatory year is a £45 million reduction to revenue and is expected to reduce base revenue in calendar years 2019 and 2020 by £30 million and £15 million.

TRU - As discussed below in "(10) Inflation adjusted, multi-year rate cycle," the base revenue for the RIIO-ED1 period was set based on 2012/13 prices. Therefore an inflation factor as determined by forecasted RPI, provided by HM Treasury, is applied to base revenue. Forecasted RPI is trued up to actuals and affects future base revenue two regulatory years later. This revenue change is called the "TRU" adjustment. 

• | The TRU for the 2015/16 regulatory year was a £31 million reduction to revenue and reduced base revenue in calendar years 2017 and 2018 by £21 million and £10 million.


• | The TRU for the 2016/17 regulatory year was a £6 million reduction to revenue and will reduce base revenue in calendar years 2018 and 2019 by £4 million and £2 million.


• | The projected TRU for the 2017/18 regulatory year is a £5 million increase to revenue and is expected to increase base revenue in calendar years 2019 and 2020 by £3 million and £2 million.

9

As both MOD and TRU are changes to future base revenues as determined by Ofgem, these adjustments are recognized as a component of revenues in future years in which service is provided and revenues are collected or returned to customers. PPL's projected earnings per share growth rate through 2020 includes both the TRU and MOD for regulatory years 2015/16 and 2016/17 and the estimated TRU and MOD for 2017/18.
(10) Inflation adjusted, multi-year rate cycle - Ofgem built its price control framework to better coincide with the long-term nature of electricity distribution investments. The current price control for electricity distribution is for the eight-year period from April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2023. This both required and enabled WPD to design a base business plan with predictable revenues and expenses over the long-term to drive value for its customers through predetermined outputs and for its investors through preset base returns. A key aspect to the multi-year cycle is an annual inflation adjustment for revenue and cost components, which are inflated using RPI from the base 2012/13 prices used to establish the business plans. Consistent with Ofgem’s formulas, the inflation adjustment is applied to base revenue, MOD and TRU when determining allowed revenue. This inflation adjustment also has the effect of inflating RAV, and real returns are earned on the inflated RAV.
(11) Incentive revenues for strong operational performance and innovation - Ofgem has established incentives to provide opportunities for DNOs to enhance overall returns by improving network efficiency, reliability and customer service. These incentives can result in an increase or reduction in revenues based on incentives or penalties for actual performance against pre-established targets based on past performance. Some of the more significant incentives that may affect allowed revenue include the Interruptions Incentive Scheme (IIS), the broad measure of customer service (BMCS) and the time to connect (TTC) incentive: 

• | The IIS has two major components: (1) Customer interruptions (CIs) and (2) Customer minutes lost (CMLs), and both are designed to incentivize the DNOs to invest in and operate their networks to manage and reduce both the frequency and duration of power outages.


• | The BMCS encompasses customer satisfaction in supply interruptions, connections and general inquiries, complaints, stakeholder engagement and delivery of social obligations.


• | The TTC incentive rewards DNOs for reducing connection times for minor connections against an Ofgem set target.

The annual incentives and penalties are reflected in customer rates on a two-year lag from the time they are earned and/or assessed. Based on applicable GAAP, incentive revenues and penalties are recorded in revenues when they are billed to customers. The following table shows the amount of incentive revenues (in total), primarily from IIS, BMCS and TTC that WPD has received and is projected to receive on a calendar year basis:

 | Incentive Received | | Calendar Year Ended Incentive
Calendar Year Ended Incentive Earned | (in millions) | | Included in Revenue 
2014 | £ | 83 | | | 2016
2015 | 79 | | | 2017
2016 | 76 | | | 2018
2017 (a) | 65-80 | | | 2019
2018 (a) | 70-85 | | | 2020


(a) | Reflects projected incentive revenues.

(12) Correction Factor (K-factor) - During the price control period, WPD sets its tariffs to recover allowed revenue. However, in any fiscal period, WPD's revenue could be negatively affected if its tariffs and the volume delivered do not fully recover the allowed revenue for a particular period. Conversely, WPD could over-recover revenue. Over- and under-recoveries are subtracted from or added to allowed revenue in future years, known as the "Correction Factor" or "K-factor." Over and under-recovered amounts during RIIO-ED1 will be refunded/recovered two regulatory years later. The K-factors created in the 2016/17 and 2015/16 regulatory years were not significant.
Historically, tariffs have been set a minimum of three months prior to the beginning of the regulatory year (April 1). In February 2015, Ofgem determined that, beginning with the 2017/18 regulatory year, tariffs would be established a minimum of fifteen months in advance. Therefore, in December 2015, WPD was required to establish tariffs for the 2016/17 and 2017/18 regulatory years. This change will potentially increase volatility in future revenue forecasts due to the need to forecast components of allowed revenue including MOD, TRU, K-factor and incentive revenues.
10

(13) Other Allowed Revenue - Other Allowed Revenue primarily consists of pass through true-ups and £5 per residential customer reduction. For a discussion on property tax true-ups, see recovery of pass through costs in "(6) Other revenue included in base revenue" above. 
In the 2016/17 regulatory year, WPD recovered a £5 per residential network customer reduction given through reduced tariffs in 2014/15. As a result, revenues were positively affected in calendar years 2017 and 2016 by £13 million and £25 million.
(14) GAAP Operating Revenue - Operating revenue under GAAP primarily consists of allowed revenue that has been collected in the calendar year converted to U.S. dollars. It also includes miscellaneous revenue primarily from engineering recharge work and ancillary activity revenue. Engineering recharge is work performed for a third party by WPD which is not for general network maintenance or to increase reliability. Examples are diversions and running new lines and equipment for a new housing complex. Ancillary activity revenue includes revenue primarily from WPD’s Telecoms and Property companies. For additional information on ancillary activity revenue, see footnote c in "Item 7. Combined Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operation - Reconciliation of Margins." The amounts of miscellaneous revenue for 2017 and 2016 were £90 million and £84 million, however, the margin or profit on these activities was not significant.
(15) Currency Hedging - Earnings generated by PPL's U.K. subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency translation risk. Due to the significant earnings contributed from WPD, PPL enters into foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the value of the GBP versus the U.S. dollar. These hedges do not receive hedge accounting treatment under GAAP. See "Overview- Financial and Operational Developments - U.K. Membership in European Union" in "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a discussion of U.K. earnings hedging activity.
GAAP Accounting implications: 
As the regulatory model in the U.K. is incentive based rather than a cost recovery model, WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP. Therefore, the accounting treatment for the accelerated recovery of depreciation, pension deficit funding, cost of debt recovery, income tax recovery and the adjustments to base revenue and/or allowed revenue is evaluated primarily based on revenue recognition guidance. 
See "Revenue Recognition" in Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information.
See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks related to our U.K. Regulated Segment" for additional information on the risks associated with the U.K. Regulated Segment.

• | Kentucky Regulated Segment (PPL)

Consists of the operations of LKE, which owns and operates regulated public utilities engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and distribution and sale of natural gas, representing primarily the activities of LG&E and KU. In addition, certain acquisition-related financing costs are allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment.  
(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

LG&E and KU, direct subsidiaries of LKE, are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Kentucky and, in KU's case, Virginia and Tennessee. LG&E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky. LG&E provides electric service to approximately 411,000 customers in Louisville and adjacent areas in Kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties and provides natural gas service to approximately 326,000 customers in its electric service area and eight additional counties in Kentucky. KU provides electric service to approximately 525,000 customers in 77 counties in central, southeastern and western Kentucky, approximately 28,000 customers in five counties in southwestern Virginia, and three customers in Tennessee, covering approximately 4,800 non-contiguous square miles. KU also sells wholesale electricity to 10 municipalities in Kentucky under load following contracts.

Franchises and Licenses

LG&E and KU provide electricity delivery service, and LG&E provides natural gas distribution service, in their respective service territories pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory service areas, easements and other rights or permissions granted by state legislatures, cities or municipalities or other entities. 
Competition
There are currently no other electric public utilities operating within the electric service areas of LKE. From time to time, bills are introduced into the Kentucky General Assembly which seek to authorize, promote or mandate increased distributed generation, customer choice or other developments. Neither the Kentucky General Assembly nor the KPSC has adopted or approved a plan or timetable for retail electric industry competition in Kentucky. The nature or timing of legislative or regulatory actions, if any, regarding industry restructuring and their impact on LKE, which may be significant, cannot currently 
12

be predicted. Virginia, formerly a deregulated jurisdiction, has enacted legislation that implemented a hybrid model of cost-based regulation. KU's operations in Virginia have been and remain regulated.

Alternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane and other fuels indirectly impact LG&E's natural gas revenues. Marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to certain large end-users. LG&E's natural gas tariffs include gas price pass-through mechanisms relating to its sale of natural gas as a commodity; therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact LG&E's profitability. Some large industrial and commercial customers, however, may physically bypass LG&E's facilities and seek delivery service directly from interstate pipelines or other natural gas distribution systems.
Power Supply

At December 31, 2017, LKE owned, controlled or had a minority ownership interest in generating capacity of 8,017 MW, of which 2,920 MW related to LG&E and 5,097 MW related to KU, in Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio. See "Item 2. Properties - Kentucky Regulated Segment" for a complete list of LKE's generating facilities. 

The system capacity of LKE's owned or controlled generation is based upon a number of factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changes in circumstances.

During 2017, LKE's power plants generated the following amounts of electricity.

 | GWh 
Fuel Source | LKE | LG&E | | KU
Coal (a) | 28,519 | | 12,161 | | 16,358
Gas | 4,625 | | 1,105 | | 3,520 
Hydro | 337 | | 278 | | 59 
Solar | 18 | | 7 | | 11 
Total (b) | 33,499 | | 13,551 | | 19,948


(a) | Includes 794 GWh of power generated by and purchased from OVEC for LKE, 549 GWh for LG&E and 245 GWh for KU.


(b) | This generation represents a 3.7% decrease for LKE, a 0.3% increase for LG&E and a 6.3% decrease for KU from 2016 output.

The majority of LG&E's and KU's generated electricity was used to supply their retail and KU's municipal customer base.

LG&E and KU jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail and municipal customers. When LG&E has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail customers and its generation cost is lower than that of KU, KU purchases electricity from LG&E and vice versa.

As a result of environmental requirements and energy efficiency measures, KU anticipates retiring two older coal-fired units at the E.W. Brown plant in 2019 with a combined summer rating capacity of 272 MW. 
In 2016, LG&E and KU completed construction activities and placed into commercial operation a 10 MW solar generating facility at the E.W. Brown generating site. Additionally, LG&E and KU received approval from the KPSC to develop a 4 MW solar share facility to service a solar share program. The solar share program is an optional, voluntary program that allows customers to subscribe capacity in the solar share facility. Construction is expected to begin, in 500-kilowatt phases, when subscription is complete. As of December 31, 2017, LG&E and KU have not yet constructed the first solar share facility and are actively marketing the program and continue to receive interest from customers.
In 2015, KU retired two coal-fired units, with a combined capacity of 161 MW, at the Green River plant. Additionally, LG&E retired three coal-fired units with a combined capacity of 563 MW, at the Cane Run plant.
Fuel Supply

Coal and natural gas will continue to be the predominant fuel used by LG&E and KU for generation for the foreseeable future. Natural gas used for generation is primarily purchased using contractual arrangements separate from LG&E's natural gas distribution operations. Natural gas and oil will continue to be used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coal-fired boilers.

13

Fuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. Reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by a number of factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues and other supplier or transporter operating difficulties.

LG&E and KU have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2023 and augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed.

For their existing units, LG&E and KU expect for the foreseeable future to purchase most of their coal from western Kentucky, southern Indiana and southern Illinois. LG&E and KU continue to purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from Wyoming for blending at Trimble County Unit 2. Coal is delivered to the generating plants primarily by barge and rail.

To enhance the reliability of natural gas supply, LG&E and KU have secured firm long-term pipeline transport capacity with contracts of various durations from 2019 to 2024 on the interstate pipeline serving Cane Run Unit 7. This pipeline also serves the six simple cycle combustion turbine units located at the Trimble County site as well as four other simple cycle units at the Cane Run and Paddy's Run sites. LG&E has also secured long-term firm pipeline transport capacity on an interstate pipeline for the summer months through October 2018 to serve an additional simple cycle gas turbine operated under a tolling agreement that ends April 30, 2019. For the seven simple cycle combustion turbines at the E.W. Brown facility, no firm long-term pipeline transport capacity has been purchased due to the facility being interconnected to two pipelines and some of the units having dual fuel capability.

LG&E and KU have firm contracts for a portion of the natural gas fuel for Cane Run Unit 7 for delivery in future months. The bulk of the natural gas fuel remains purchased on the spot market. 
(PPL, LKE and LG&E)
Natural Gas Distribution Supply

Five underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 billion cubic feet (Bcf), are used in providing natural gas service to LG&E's firm sales customers. By using natural gas storage facilities, LG&E avoids the costs typically associated with more expensive pipeline transportation capacity to serve peak winter heating loads. Natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal during the following winter heating season. Without this storage capacity, LG&E would be required to purchase additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and the prices for natural gas supply and transportation services can be expected to be at their highest. At December 31, 2017, LG&E had 12 Bcf of natural gas stored underground with a carrying value of $43 million.
LG&E has a portfolio of supply arrangements of varying durations and terms that provide competitively priced natural gas designed to meet its firm sales obligations. These natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are market-responsive. In tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve LG&E's natural gas customers.

LG&E purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines. LG&E has contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by LG&E between 2020 and 2023. Total winter season capacity under these contracts is 184,900 MMBtu/day and summer season capacity is 60,000 MMBtu/day. With this same pipeline, LG&E also has another contract for pipeline capacity through 2026 in the amount of 60,000 MMBtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons. LG&E has a single contract with a second pipeline with a total capacity of 20,000 MMBtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons that expires in 2023.

LG&E expects to purchase natural gas supplies for its gas distribution operations from onshore producing regions in South Texas, East Texas, North Louisiana and Arkansas, as well as gas originating in the Marcellus and Utica production areas.

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)
Transmission
LG&E and KU contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator and contract with TranServ International, Inc. to act as their independent transmission organization.

14

Rates

LG&E is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and the FERC, and KU is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC, the FERC and the VSCC. LG&E and KU operate under a FERC-approved open access transmission tariff.

LG&E's and KU's Kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. As such, LG&E and KU generally earn a return on regulatory assets in Kentucky.
KU's Virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except the levelized fuel factor, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia base rates, no return is earned on the related assets.

KU's rates to 10 municipal customers for wholesale power requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a formula rate that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except regulatory assets recorded for AROs related to CCR impoundments, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates, no return is earned on the related assets. In April 2014, nine municipalities submitted notices of termination, under the notice period provisions, to cease taking power under the wholesale requirements contracts. Such terminations are to be effective in 2019, except in the case of one municipality that terminated service in 2017.
Rate Case Proceedings
(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)
In November 2016, LG&E and KU filed requests with the KPSC for increases in annual base electricity and gas rates. LG&E's and KU's applications included requests for CPCNs for implementing an Advanced Metering System program and a Distribution Automation program.
In April and May 2017, LG&E and KU, along with all intervening parties to the proceeding, filed with the KPSC, stipulation and recommendation agreements (stipulations) resolving all issues with the parties. Among other things, the proposed stipulations provided for increases in annual revenue requirements associated with LG&E base electricity rates of $59 million, LG&E base gas rates of $8 million and KU base electricity rates of $55 million, reflecting a return on equity of 9.75%, the withdrawal of LG&E's and KU's request for a CPCN for the Advanced Metering System and other changes to the revenue requirements, which dealt primarily with the timing of cost recovery, including depreciation rates.
In June 2017, the KPSC issued orders approving, with certain modifications, the proposed stipulations filed in April and May 2017. The orders modified the stipulations to provide for increases in annual revenue requirements associated with LG&E base electricity rates of $57 million, LG&E base gas rates of $7 million, KU base electricity rates of $52 million and incorporated an authorized return on equity of 9.7%. Consistent with the stipulations, the orders approved LG&E's and KU's request for implementing a Distribution Automation program and their withdrawal of a request for a CPCN for the Advanced Metering System program. The orders also approved new depreciation rates for LG&E and KU that resulted in higher depreciation of approximately $15 million ($4 million for LG&E and $11 million for KU) in 2017, exclusive of net additions to PP&E. The orders resulted in base electricity and gas rate increases of 5.2% and 2.1% at LG&E and a base electricity rate increase of 3.2% at KU. The new base rates and all elements of the orders became effective July 1, 2017. On June 23, 2017, the KPSC issued orders establishing an authorized return on equity of 9.7% for all of LG&E's and KU's existing approved ECR plans and projects, replacing the prior authorized return on equity levels of 9.8% for CCR projects and 10% for all other ECR approved projects, effective with bills issued in August 2017. The annual impact of the new authorized return for ECR projects is not expected to be significant.
(LKE and KU)
On September 29, 2017, KU filed a request seeking approval from the VSCC to increase annual Virginia base electricity revenue by $7 million, representing an increase of 10.4%. KU's request is based on an authorized 10.42% return on equity. Subject to regulatory review and approval, new rates would become effective July 1, 2018.
15

(PPL, LKE and KU)
In October 2016, KU filed a request with the FERC to modify its formula rates to provide for the recovery of CCR impoundment closure costs from its departing municipal customers. In December 2016, the FERC accepted the revised rate schedules providing recovery of the costs effective December 31, 2016, subject to refund, and established limited hearing and settlement judge procedures relating to determining the applicable amortization period. In March 2017, the parties reached a settlement in principle regarding a suitable amortization period. In June 2017, a FERC judge issued an order implementing the settlement's rates on an interim basis, effective July 1, 2017. In August 2017, the FERC issued a final order approving the settlement.
TCJA Impact on LG&E and KU Rates
(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)
On December 21, 2017, Kentucky Industrial Utility Customers, Inc. submitted a complaint with the KPSC against LG&E and KU, as well as other utility companies in Kentucky, alleging that their respective rates would no longer be fair, just and reasonable following the enactment of the TCJA reducing the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The complaint requested the KPSC to issue an order requiring LG&E and KU to begin deferring, as of January 1, 2018, the revenue requirement effect of all income tax expense savings resulting from the federal corporate income tax reduction, including the amortization of excess deferred income taxes by recording those savings in a regulatory liability account and establishing a process by which the federal corporate income tax savings will be passed back to customers.
On December 27, 2017, as a result of the complaint, the KPSC ordered LG&E and KU to satisfy or address the complaint and commence recording regulatory liabilities to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate to 21% and the associated savings in excess deferred taxes on an interim basis until utility rates are adjusted to reflect the federal tax savings. 
On January 8, 2018, LG&E and KU responded to the complaint, denying certain claims in the complaint but concurring that the TCJA will result in savings for their customers. LG&E and KU have stated in their responses that the companies have recorded regulatory liabilities as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate and the associated savings in excess deferred taxes and will make changes to their ECR, DSM and LG&E's GLT rate mechanisms to begin providing the applicable savings to customers. LG&E and KU also offered to establish a new bill credit mechanism effective with the April 2018 billing cycle to begin distributing the tax savings associated with base rates to customers.
On January 29, 2018, LG&E and KU reached a settlement agreement to commence returning savings related to the TCJA to their customers. The savings will be distributed through their ECR, DSM and LG&E's GLT rate mechanisms beginning in March 2018 and through a new bill credit mechanism from April 1, 2018 through April 30, 2019. The estimated impact of the rate reduction represents approximately $91 million in KU electricity revenues, $69 million in LG&E electricity revenues and $17 million in LG&E gas revenues for the period January 2018 through April 2019. Ongoing tax savings are expected to also be addressed in LG&E's and KU's next Kentucky base rate case. LG&E and KU have indicated their intent to file an application for base rate changes during 2018 to be effective during spring 2019. The settlement agreement is subject to review and approval by the KPSC. An order in the proceeding may occur during the first quarter of 2018.
Additionally, on January 8, 2018, the VSCC ordered KU, as well as other utilities in Virginia, to accrue regulatory liabilities reflecting the Virginia jurisdictional revenue requirement impacts of the reduced federal corporate tax rate.
The FERC has not issued any guidance on the effect on rates of the TCJA. 
LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.

• | Pennsylvania Regulated Segment (PPL)

Consists of PPL Electric, a regulated public utility engaged in the distribution and transmission of electricity.

(PPL and PPL Electric)

PPL Electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties of eastern and central Pennsylvania. PPL Electric also provides electricity supply to retail customers in this area as a PLR under the Customer Choice Act.

Details of revenues, in millions, by customer class for the years ended December 31 are shown below.

(a) | Includes regulatory over- or under-recovery reconciliation mechanisms, pole attachment revenues and street lighting, offset by contra revenue associated with the network integration transmission service expense.

Franchise, Licenses and Other Regulations
PPL Electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in corporate charters to PPL Electric and companies, which it has succeeded and as a result of certification by the PUC. PPL Electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the Commonwealth subject to certain conditions. In general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth.
Competition
Pursuant to authorizations from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the PUC, PPL Electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. Accordingly, PPL Electric does not face competition in its electricity distribution business. Pursuant to the Customer Choice Act, generation of electricity is a competitive business in Pennsylvania, and PPL Electric does not own or operate any generation facilities.

The PPL Electric transmission business, operating under a FERC-approved PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to FERC Order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent PJM transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within PJM.
Rates and Regulation

Transmission

PPL Electric's transmission facilities are within PJM, which operates the electricity transmission network and electric energy market in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the U.S.

PJM serves as a FERC-approved Regional Transmission Operator (RTO) to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves. In addition to operating the electricity transmission network, PJM also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. A primary objective of any RTO is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. Electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the RTO directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. Certain types of transmission investment are subject to competitive processes outlined in the PJM tariff.
17

As a transmission owner, PPL Electric's transmission revenues are recovered through PJM and billed in accordance with a FERC-approved Open Access Transmission Tariff that allows recovery of incurred transmission costs, a return on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update based on a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. Under this formula, rates are put into effect in June of each year based upon prior year actual expenditures and current year forecasted capital additions. Rates are then adjusted the following year to reflect actual annual expenses and capital additions, as reported in PPL Electric’s annual FERC Form 1, filed under the FERC’s Uniform System of Accounts. Any difference between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual expenditures incurred for that year is recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. Any change in the prior year PPL zonal peak load billing factor applied on January 1st of each year, will result in an increase or decrease in revenue until the next annual rate update goes into effect on June 1st of that same year.
As a PLR, PPL Electric also purchases transmission services from PJM. See "PLR" below.

See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information on rate mechanisms.

Distribution

PPL Electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets unless specifically provided for by the PUC. Currently, PPL Electric's Smart Meter rider and the DSIC are the only riders authorized to earn a return. Certain operating expenses are also included in PPL Electric's distribution base rates including wages and benefits, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and taxes.

Pennsylvania's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) requires electricity distribution companies and electricity generation suppliers to obtain from alternative energy resources a portion of the electricity sold to retail customers in Pennsylvania. Under the default service procurement plans approved by the PUC, PPL Electric purchases all of the alternative energy generation supply it needs to comply with the AEPS.

Act 129 created an energy efficiency and conservation program, a demand side management program, smart metering technology requirements, new PLR generation supply procurement rules, remedies for market misconduct and changes to the existing AEPS.

Act 11 authorizes the PUC to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms: the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a DSIC. Such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore, are important to PPL Electric as it is in a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of its delivery system, including the replacement of aging assets. PPL Electric has utilized the fully projected future test year mechanism in its 2015 base rate proceeding. PPL has had the ability to utilize the DSIC recovery mechanism since July 2013.

See "Regulatory Matters - Pennsylvania Activities" in Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding Act 129 and other legislative and regulatory impacts.

PLR

The Customer Choice Act requires Electric Distribution Companies (EDCs), including PPL Electric, or an alternative supplier approved by the PUC to act as a PLR of electricity supply for customers who do not choose to shop for supply with a competitive supplier and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by the PLR pursuant to PUC regulations. In 2017, the following average percentages of PPL Electric's customer load were provided by competitive suppliers: 46% of residential, 85% of small commercial and industrial and 98% of large commercial and industrial customers. The PUC continues to favor expanding the competitive market for electricity. See "Regulatory Matters - Pennsylvania Activities - Act 129" in Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

PPL Electric's cost of electricity generation is based on a competitive solicitation process. The PUC approved PPL Electric's default service plan for the period June 2015 through May 2017, which included 4 solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in April and October. The PUC approved PPL Electric's default service plan for the period June 2017 through May 2021, which includes a total of 8 solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in April and October. Pursuant to both the current and future plans, PPL Electric contracts for all of the electricity supply for residential customers and commercial and industrial customers who elect to take that service from PPL Electric. These solicitations include a mix of 6- and 12-month fixed-price load-following contracts for residential and small commercial and industrial customers, and 12-

month real-time pricing contracts for large commercial and industrial customers to fulfill PPL Electric's obligation to provide customer electricity supply as a PLR.

Numerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in PPL Electric's service territory. Since the cost of generation supply is a pass-through cost for PPL Electric, its financial results are not impacted if its customers purchase electricity supply from these alternative suppliers. 
TCJA Impact on PPL Electric Rates
The PUC issued a Secretarial Letter on February 12, 2018 regarding the TCJA. The Commission is requesting comments from interested parties addressing whether the Commission should adjust current customer rates to reflect the reduced federal income tax expense and, if so, the appropriate negative surcharge or other methodology that would permit immediate adjustment to consumer rates, and whether the surcharge or other said methodology should provide that any refunds to customers due to reduced taxes be effective as of January 1, 2018. In addition, the Secretarial Letter requests certain Pennsylvania regulated utilities, including PPL Electric, to provide certain data related to the effect of the TCJA on PPL Electric’s income tax expense and rate base including whether any of the potential tax savings from the reduced federal corporate tax rate can be used for purposes other than to reduce customer rates. PPL Electric’s responses are due to the PUC not later than March 9, 2018. 
The FERC has not issued any guidance on the effect on rates of the TCJA.

• | Corporate and Other

PPL Services provides PPL subsidiaries with administrative, management and support services. The costs of these services are charged directly to the respective recipients for the services provided or indirectly charged to applicable recipients based on an average of the recipients' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees or a ratio of overall direct and indirect costs.
PPL Capital Funding, PPL's financing subsidiary, provides financing for the operations of PPL and certain subsidiaries. PPL's growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through PPL Capital Funding, that enables PPL to cost effectively support targeted credit profiles across all of PPL's rated companies. As a result, PPL plans to utilize PPL Capital Funding as a source of capital in future financings, in addition to continued direct financing by the operating companies.

Unlike PPL Services, PPL Capital Funding's costs are not generally charged to PPL subsidiaries. Costs are charged directly to PPL. However, PPL Capital Funding participated significantly in the financing for the acquisitions of LKE and WPD Midlands and certain associated financing costs were allocated to the Kentucky Regulated and U.K. Regulated segments. The associated financing costs, as well as the financing costs associated with prior issuances of certain other PPL Capital Funding securities, have been assigned to the appropriate segments for purposes of PPL management's assessment of segment performance. The financing costs associated primarily with PPL Capital Funding's securities issuances beginning in 2013, with certain exceptions, have not been directly assigned or allocated to any segment.
Spinoff of PPL Energy Supply

In June 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply executed definitive agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to spin off PPL Energy Supply and immediately combine it with Riverstone's competitive power generation businesses to form a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named Talen Energy. On April 29, 2015, PPL's Board of Directors declared the June 1, 2015 distribution to PPL's shareowners of record on May 20, 2015 of a newly formed entity, Holdco, which at closing owned all of the membership interests of PPL Energy Supply and all of the common stock of Talen Energy.

Immediately following the spinoff on June 1, 2015, Holdco merged with a special purpose subsidiary of Talen Energy, with Holdco continuing as the surviving company to the merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Talen Energy and the sole owner of PPL Energy Supply. Substantially contemporaneous with the spinoff and merger, RJS Power was contributed by its owners to become a subsidiary of Talen Energy. PPL's shareowners received approximately 0.1249 shares of Talen Energy common stock for each share of PPL common stock they owned on May 20, 2015. Following completion of these transactions, PPL shareowners owned 65% of Talen Energy and affiliates of Riverstone owned 35%. The spinoff had no effect on the

number of PPL common shares owned by PPL shareowners or the number of shares of PPL common stock outstanding. The transaction is intended to be tax-free to PPL and its shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

PPL has no continuing ownership interest in or control of Talen Energy and Talen Energy Supply (formerly PPL Energy Supply).

CYBERSECURITY MANAGEMENT
The Registrants and their subsidiaries are subject to risks from cyber-attacks that have the potential to cause significant interruptions to the operation of their businesses. The frequency of these attempted intrusions has increased in recent years and the sources, motivations and techniques of attack continue to evolve and change rapidly. PPL has undertaken a variety of actions to monitor and address cyber-related risks. Cybersecurity and the effectiveness of PPL’s cybersecurity strategy are regular topics of discussion at Board and Audit Committee meetings. PPL's strategy for managing cyber-related risks is risk-based and, where appropriate, integrated within the company's enterprise risk management processes. PPL’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer, leads a dedicated cybersecurity team and is responsible for the design, implementation, and execution of cyber-risk management strategy. Among other things, the CISO and the cybersecurity team actively monitor the Registrants' systems, regularly review policies, compliance, regulations and best practices, perform penetration testing, lead response exercises and internal campaigns, and provide training and communication across the organization to strengthen secure behavior. The cybersecurity team also routinely participates in industry-wide programs to further information sharing, intelligence gathering, and unity of effort in responding to potential or actual attacks. In addition to these enterprise-wide initiatives, PPL’s Kentucky and Pennsylvania operations are subject to extensive and rigorous mandatory cybersecurity requirements that are developed and enforced by NERC and approved by FERC to protect grid security and reliability. Finally, PPL purchases insurance to protect against a wide range of costs that could be incurred in connection with cyber-related incidents. There can be no assurance, however, that these efforts will be effective to prevent interruption of services or other damage to the Registrants' businesses or operations or that PPL's insurance coverage will cover all costs incurred in connection with any cyber-related incident.
