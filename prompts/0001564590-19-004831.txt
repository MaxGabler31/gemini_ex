Our Company
 PGT Innovations, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “PGTI” or the “Company”) is the leading U.S. manufacturer and supplier of impact-resistant residential windows and doors, and we believe the “PGT” brand is the most recognized brand in the U.S. for these products. Having pioneered the development of these products over two decades ago, we believe our products to be the most technologically advanced impact-resistant window and door products in the industry. We manufacture complete lines of high-end, luxury, premium and mass-custom fully customizable aluminum and vinyl windows and doors and porch enclosure products, targeting both the residential repair and remodeling and new construction end markets. We market our impact-resistant products under three recognized brands: PGT® Custom Windows & Doors, CGI® Windows and Doors and WinDoor®, the last two of which we have acquired since 2014, and we believe are all positively associated with service, performance, quality, durability and energy efficiency. We recently acquired the brands and operations of Western Window Systems, as part of the Western Window Systems Acquisition. Like our legacy brands, we believe that the Western Window Systems brands are associated with innovation, quality, durability and energy efficiency in the indoor/outdoor living space markets. 

• | On September 22, 2014, we acquired CGI, an innovator in impact-resistant product craftsmanship, strength and style that is recognized and respected in the architect community.

• | On February 16, 2016, we completed the acquisition of WinDoor, a provider of high-performance, impact-resistant windows and doors to five-star resorts, luxury condominiums, high-rise multi-family buildings, hotels and custom high-end single-family homes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On September 6, 2016, we acquired an established fabricator of impact-resistant storefront window and door products, US Impact Systems, Inc. (“USI”), and announced the formation of CGIC, the brand and company through which we sell the former USI products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On August 13, 2018, we completed the acquisition (the “WWS Acquisition”) of GEF WW Parent LLC (now known as WWS Acquisition LLC) (“Western Window Systems” or “WWS”) and its subsidiaries, an award-winning designer and manufacturer of premium contemporary doors and window systems with a focus on unifying indoor/outdoor living spaces. The Western Window Systems Acquisition has increased and diversified our product offerings, enabling us to expand beyond our current geographically focused portfolio of primarily impact-resistant products to include contemporary door and window systems that unify indoor/outdoor living for the residential, commercial and multi-family markets.

 On December 14, 2016, we announced the unveiling of our new name, PGT Innovations, Inc., formerly PGT, Inc., as part of our strategy to bring together under a single identity our various go-to-market brands serving all levels of the premium impact-resistant residential window and door market, from mass custom to high-end, luxury products, as well as the light commercial market. We believe these strategic decisions have solidified our position as the leading manufacturer and supplier of impact-resistant windows and doors in the U.S. reflecting our focus in expanding into other innovative brands, including through potential acquisitions designed to diversify and broaden our product portfolio and/or the geographic markets where our products are sold. 
 Our products are highly engineered and technically advanced windows and doors that can withstand some of the toughest weather conditions on earth, such as hurricane-force winds. Our impact-resistant products combine heavy-duty aluminum or vinyl 28frames with laminated glass to ensure structural integrity, which provides protection from wind-driven projectiles of all sizes and other debris during a storm. Our impact-resistant products substantially reduce the likelihood of penetration by impacting projectiles, protecting people and property, while providing expansive, unblocked exterior views that other forms of protection, such as shutters or wood coverings, do not provide. Our impact-resistant products also offer many other benefits, including: (1) abatement of sound to substantially decrease outside noise, including during hurricanes; (2) protection against the damaging effects of ultra-violet light; (3) reduction of energy loss due to changing external temperatures; and (4) energy efficiency that can significantly reduce cooling and heating costs, as evidenced by the energy ratings our products have received. These impact-resistant products satisfy the nation’s most stringent building codes in hurricane-prone coastal states and provide an attractive alternative to shutters and other “active” forms of hurricane protection that require installation and removal before and after each storm. We also manufacture vinyl porch and patio enclosure products that are designed to allow air flow while protecting against inclement weather, making outdoor spaces more inviting.
 The addition of WWS to our family of brands expands our portfolio of offerings and adds award-winning and innovative products that combine performance and quality with clean, functional designs. Its products are designed for strength, easy integration into a variety of spaces, smooth operation and are tested for durability.

Since 1959, WWS has manufactured moving glass walls, windows and doors that blend the indoors with the outside, including its recent offerings of contemporary products designed to unify indoor/outdoor living spaces. Its current products are highly engineered, premium, aluminum and fiberglass hybrid products that include folding and sliding door systems, windows, doors and window walls. WWS regularly develops new products, many of which are designed to satisfy some of the most stringent energy efficiency rating requirements in North America, including the strictest building energy codes in the United States, which are found in California. Inspired by contemporary living and energy conservation, WWS’s products are available in custom sizes, standardized sets, and large dimensions to provide flexibility and numerous design possibilities in residential, multi-family, and commercial applications. The energy efficient designs of WWS’s products make them suitable for both high and low temperature climates.
 Our current market share in Florida, which is the largest impact-resistant window and door market in the U.S., is greater than that of any competitor. We believe our leading market position is derived from our broad and high-quality product offerings, continuous innovation, well-recognized brands, strong customer relationships, technical capabilities, customer care and extensive knowledge of and involvement in developments regarding hurricane-protection building codes and testing protocols.
 WWS’s primary markets are in California, Texas, Arizona and Nevada, where there has been favorable economic and housing trends compared to the broader U.S. economy and housing markets. The addition of WWS gives us a foothold in these key markets in the West and Southwest, where evolving consumer preferences toward indoor/outdoor living and contemporary narrow site-line designs are still early in their growth are expected to provide in product areas in which WWS benefits from a first mover advantage. WWS will also now have the opportunity to expand into regions in the Southeast U.S. where our operations are already established.
 With approximately 3,000 employees (as of December 29, 2018) at our various manufacturing facilities located in North Venice, Orlando and Miami, Florida, and Phoenix, Arizona, our vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities include in-house glass cutting, tempering, laminating and insulating capabilities, which provide us with a consistent source of specialized glass, shorter lead times, lower costs relative to third-party sourcing and an overall more efficient production process. Additionally, our manufacturing process relies on just-in-time delivery of raw materials and components as well as synchronous flow to promote labor efficiency and throughput, allowing us to more consistently fulfill orders on-time for our valued customers. 
 The geographic regions in which we currently conduct business include the Southeastern U.S., Western U.S., Gulf Coast, Coastal mid-Atlantic, the Caribbean, Central America and Canada. We distribute our products through multiple channels, including approximately 1,500 independently-owned dealers and distributors, national building supply distributors, and the in-home sales/custom order divisions of major U.S. home building and improvement supply retailers. We believe this broad distribution network provides us with the flexibility to meet demand as it shifts between the repair and remodel and residential new construction end markets.
 History

EnergyVue. EnergyVue is our non-impact vinyl window featuring energy-efficient insulating glass and multi-chambered frames that meet or exceed ENERGY STAR® standards in all climate zones to help consumers save on energy costs.  Its new design has a refined modern profile and robust construction and is offered in larger sizes and higher design pressures, multiple frame colors, and a variety of hardware finishes, glass tints, grid styles and patterns. We announced the launch of EnergyVue in the first quarter of 2015.
 Aluminum. We offer a complete line of fully customizable, non-impact-resistant aluminum frame windows and doors. These products primarily target regions with warmer climates, where aluminum is often preferred due to its ability to withstand higher structural loads. Adding insulating glass creates energy-efficient windows that can significantly reduce cooling and heating costs. 
 Eze-Breeze. Eze-Breeze non-glass vertical and horizontal sliding panels for porch enclosures are vinyl-glazed, aluminum-framed products used for enclosing screened-in porches that provide protection from inclement weather. This line was completed with the addition of a cabana door. 
 CGI
 CGI’s products carry the CGI® brand and carry the trademarked product names of Estate Collection, Sentinel by CGI, Estate Entrances, Commercial Series and Targa by CGI. Also, under CGI, CGIC sells the Company’s commercial storefront system.
 Estate Collection. Our Estate Collection of windows and doors is CGI’s premium aluminum impact-resistant product line. These windows and doors can be found in high-end homes, resorts and hotels, and in schools and office buildings. Our Estate Collection combines protection against hurricane force damage with architectural-grade quality, handcrafted details and modern engineering. These windows and doors protect and insulate against hurricane winds and wind-driven debris, outside noise, and offer UV protection. Estate’s aluminum frames are thicker than many of our competitors’ frames, making it a preferable choice for consumers in coastal areas prone to hurricanes. In January 2019, consistent with management’s plan for this product line, we began the process of rebranding our Estate Collection as WinDoor-branded products. This rebranding aligns the Estate Collection’s status as a high-end, luxury product line, with WinDoor’s focus on the luxury market. We anticipate completion of this rebranding in the first half of 2020.
 Sentinel. Sentinel is a complete line of aluminum impact-resistant windows and doors from CGI that provides quality craftsmanship, energy efficiency and durability at a lower price point than our Estate Collection. Sentinel windows and doors are designed and manufactured with the objectives of enhancing home aesthetics, while delivering protection from hurricane winds and wind-borne debris. Sentinel is custom manufactured to exact sizes within our wide range of design parameters, therefore, reducing on-site construction costs. In addition, Sentinel’s frame depth is designed for both new construction and replacement applications, resulting in faster, less intrusive installations.
 Targa. Targa is CGI’s line of vinyl, energy-efficient, impact-resistant windows designed specifically to exceed the Florida impact codes, which are the most stringent impact standards in the U.S. Targa windows are designed with the objective of enhancing the aesthetics of a home, are relatively low maintenance, with long-term durability, and environmental compatibility.
 Commercial Storefront System. Our Commercial Storefront window system and entry doors are engineered to provide a flexible yet economical solution for a variety of applications. Our system is designed with the goal of providing easy fabrication and assembly, while also reducing installation time and challenges.
 WinDoor
 WinDoor’s products carry the WinDoor® brand and carry various product names, including its 3000 and 4000 Series aluminum windows, its 6000, 7000 and 8000 Series aluminum sliding glass doors, and its 9000 Series thermally broken windows and doors.
 Aluminum Doors and Windows. WinDoor produces a wide array of high-end, luxury aluminum doors and windows, including impact and non-impact sliding glass doors and terrace doors, fixed picture windows, single hung windows, and horizontal rolling windows. All of WinDoor’s aluminum windows are available in impact and non-impact versions and meet or exceed ENERGY STAR® standards in all climate zones.
 Thermally Broken Doors and Windows. WinDoor produces a variety of aluminum thermally broken doors and windows. WinDoor’s thermally broken products provide the strength of aluminum with the energy ratings usually seen in only vinyl products. All of WinDoor’s thermally broken products are available in multiple shapes and sizes, have earned high performance ratings on impact and non-impact certifications, and meet or exceed ENERGY STAR® standards in all climate zones.

Performance Line, and the Simulated Steel Line, which is a thermally-broken product
 Classic Line. WWS’s Classic Line is a portfolio of high-quality, disappearing glass walls and windows that combine exceptional performance with clean design. The products of the Classic Line include fixed and operating windows, as well as well as sliding, folding and hinged doors.
 Performance Line. The Performance Line by WWS is a family of moving glass walls and windows engineered to satisfy its customers’ energy and structural requirements, while promoting a contemporary design.
 Simulated Steel Line. The Simulated Steel Line by WWS is a portfolio of thermally-broken, aluminum moving glass walls and windows that look like steel but are far more affordable. This portfolio of products embodies WWS’s nearly 60 years of advancements in door and window design, which we believe reach new heights of luxury and refinement. The Simulated Steel Line is a top choice among architects due to its clean, narrow profiles which keeps the glass big, maximizing natural light.
Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales strategy primarily focuses on attracting and retaining distributors and dealers with an expectation of consistently providing exceptional customer service, leading product designs and quality, and competitive pricing all using our advanced knowledge of building code requirements and technical expertise. 
 Our marketing strategy is designed to reinforce the quality of our products and focuses on both coastal and inland markets. We support our customers through print and web-based advertising, consumer, dealer, and builder promotions, and selling and collateral materials. We also work with our dealers and distributors to educate architects, building officials, consumers and homebuilders on the advantages of using impact-resistant and energy-efficient products. We market our products based on our expectations of quality, building code compliance, outstanding service, shorter lead times, and on-time delivery using our fleet of trucks and trailers. 
 Our Customers 
 We have a highly diversified base of approximately 1,500 window distributors, building supply distributors, window replacement dealers and enclosure contractors. Our largest customer accounts for approximately 4% of net sales and our top ten customers account for approximately 22% of net sales. Our sales are driven by residential new construction and home repair and remodeling end markets, which represented approximately 41% and 59% of our sales, respectively, during 2018. This compares to 39% and 61%, respectively, in 2017. 
 We do not supply our products directly to homebuilders but believe demand for our products is also a function of our strong relationships with certain national homebuilders. 
 Materials, Inventory and Supplier Relationships 
 Our primary manufacturing materials include aluminum and vinyl extrusions, glass, ionoplast, and polyvinyl butyral. Although in many instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by either party on limited notice. While most of our materials are typically available from other sources, transitioning to alternative sources would require us to complete testing and certifications related to impact-resistance and for the alternative source of supply to create the customized equipment and tooling necessary to provide the materials and components to us. Therefore, our goal is to develop and maintain lasting relationships with our material suppliers.
 Aluminum and vinyl extrusions accounted for approximately 41% of our material purchases during 2018. Sheet glass, which is sourced from two major national suppliers, accounted for approximately 7% of our material purchases during 2018. Sheet glass that we purchase comes in various sizes, tints, and thermal properties. From the sheet glass purchased, we produce some of our own laminated glass needs. However, in 2017 and 2016 due to some temporary capacity constraints, we purchased some of our laminated glass needs. This finished laminated glass made up approximately 18% of our material purchases in 2018. Polyvinyl butyral and ionoplast, which are both used as inner layer in laminated glass, accounted for approximately 6% of our material purchases during 2018.
 On September 22, 2017, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) with Cardinal LG Company (Cardinal) for the sale to Cardinal of certain manufacturing equipment we used in processing glass components for PGT-branded doors for a cash purchase price of $28 million. Contemporaneously with entering into the APA, we entered into a seven-year supply agreement (SA) with Cardinal for Cardinal to supply us with glass components for PGT-branded doors. The Company determined to sell these assets and enter into the SA to allow us to heighten our focus in our core areas of window and door manufacturing and, at the same time, strengthen our supply chain for high-quality door glass from a supplier with whom we have been doing business for many years. 
 Our inventory consists principally of raw materials purchased for the manufacture of our products and limited finished goods inventory as the majority of our products are custom, made-to-order products. Our inventory levels are more closely aligned with our 
 - 7 -


number of product offerings rather than our level of sales. We have maintained our inventory level to have (i) raw materials required to support new product launches; (ii) a sufficient level of safety stock on certain items to ensure an adequate supply of material in the event of a sudden increase in demand and given our short lead-times; and (iii) adequate lead times for raw materials purchased from overseas suppliers in bulk supply.
 Backlog 
 As of December 29, 2018, our backlog was $63.7 million, which included $11.0 million relating to WWS. As of December 30, 2017, our backlog was $51.3 million. Our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers that have not yet shipped, and we expect that a significant portion of our current backlog will be recognized as sales in the first quarter of 2019, due in part to our lead times which typically range from one to five weeks.
Intellectual Property 
 We own and have registered trademarks in the U.S., including several acquired with WWS. In addition, we own several patents and patent applications concerning various aspects of window assembly and related processes. We are not aware of any circumstances that would have a material adverse effect on our ability to use our trademarks and patents. If we continue to renew our trademarks when necessary, the trademark protection provided by them is perpetual. 
Manufacturing 
 Our manufacturing facilities are in Florida, where we produce customized impact-resistant and non-impact products, and in Arizona, where we produce customized non-impact products for the custom channel of our WWS brand, and standard products for its volume channel. The manufacturing process typically begins in our glass plant where we cut, temper, laminate, and insulate sheet glass to meet specific requirements of our customers’ orders, although our Hialeah, Florida, and Orlando, Florida facilities source their glass needs from external suppliers. 
 Glass is transported to our window and door assembly lines in a make-to-order sequence where it is combined with an aluminum or vinyl frame. These frames are also fabricated to order. We start with a piece of extruded material which is cut and shaped into a frame that fits the customers’ specifications. Once complete, product is immediately staged for delivery and generally shipped on our trucking fleet within 48 hours of completion. 
 Competition 
 The window and door industry is highly fragmented, and the competitive landscape is based on geographic scope. The competition falls into the following categories. 
 Local and Regional Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors consists of numerous local job shops and small manufacturing facilities that tend to focus on selling products to local or regional dealers and wholesalers. Competitors in this group typically lack marketing support and the service levels and quality controls demanded by larger customers, as well as the ability to offer a full complement of products. 
 National Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors tends to focus on selling branded products nationally to dealers and wholesalers and has multiple locations.
 The primary competitors of our WWS brand in its custom sales channel include the following aluminum window manufacturers, all based on the West Coast of the U.S.: Fleetwood Windows & Doors, Heritage Aluminum, Panda, and La Cantina. In the Corporate Builder sales channel, several competitors to Western Window Systems have been introducing low-cost competitive products, including Win-Dor California, Avanti, and Cascade. In the emerging commercial space, Western Window Systems identifies EFCO, Arcadia, and Wasau as competitors. 
 International Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors consists of non-U.S. companies that have created entities and established manufacturing operations within Florida and have an increasing presence in the South Florida region as suppliers of windows and doors, primarily for high-rise buildings. 
 Active Protection: This group of competitors consists of manufacturers that produce shutters and plywood, both of which are used to actively protect openings. Our impact-resistant windows and doors represent passive protection, meaning, once installed, no activity is required to protect a home from storm related hazards.
 The principal methods of competition in the window and door industry are the development of long-term relationships with window and door dealers and distributors, and the retention of customers by delivering a full range of high-quality products in a timely manner, while offering competitive pricing and flexibility in transaction processing. Trade professionals such as contractors,

homebuilders, architects and engineers also engage in direct interaction with manufacturers and look to the manufacturer for training and education related to products and codes. We believe our leading position in the U.S. impact-resistant window and door market, and the award-winning designs and quality of our products, position us well to meet the needs of our customers. 
 Environmental Considerations 
 Although our business and facilities are subject to federal, state, and local environmental regulation, environmental regulation does not have a material impact on our operations, and we believe that our facilities are in material compliance with such laws and regulations. 
Employees 
 As of the end of 2018, we employed approximately 3,000 people, none of whom were represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
