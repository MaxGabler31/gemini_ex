ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
Intellinetics, formerly known as GlobalWise Investments, Inc. is a Nevada holding company incorporated in 1997, with two wholly-owned subsidiaries: (i) Intellinetics, Ohio, an Ohio corporation and (ii) Graphic Sciences, a Michigan corporation. Intellinetics Ohio was incorporated in 1996, and on February 10, 2012, Intellinetics Ohio became the sole operating subsidiary of Intellinetics as a result of a reverse merger and recapitalization. On March 2, 2020, Intellinetics purchased Graphic Sciences, Inc.
 
We are a document services and software solutions company serving both the small-to-medium business and governmental sectors with their digital transformation and process automation initiatives. During 2020, we made two significant business acquisitions that have significantly impacted our financial operations and grown our business operations:
 

● | Graphic Sciences, on March 2, 2020, and 
--+--------------------------------------------
● | CEO Image, on April 21, 2020. 

 
For further information about these acquisitions, please see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report.
 
Our products and services are provided through two reporting segments: Document Management and Document Conversion. Our Document Management segment, which includes our CEO Image acquisition, consists primarily of solutions involving our software platform, allowing customers to capture and manage their documents across operations such as scanned hard-copy documents and digital documents including those from Microsoft Office 365, digital images, audio, video and emails. Our Document Conversion segment, which includes and primarily consists of our Graphic Sciences acquisition, provides digital transformation assistance to customers converting documents from one medium to another, predominantly paper to digital, potentially including migration to our software solutions, as well as long-term storage and retrieval services. Our solutions create value for customers by making it easy to connect business-critical documents to the people and processes who need them by making those documents easy to find and act upon, while also being secure, compliant, and audit-ready. Solutions are sold both directly to end-users and through resellers.
 
Our customers use our software by one of two methods: purchasing our software and installing it onto their own equipment, which we refer to as a “premise” model, or licensing and accessing our platform via the Internet, which we refer to as a “software as a service” or “SaaS” model and also as a “cloud-based” model. Licensing of our software through our SaaS model has become increasingly popular among our customers, especially in light of the increased deployment of remote workforce policies, and is a key ingredient in our revenue growth strategy. Our SaaS products are hosted with Amazon Web Services and Expedient, providing our customers with reliable hosting services that we believe are consistent with industry best practices in data security and performance.
 
We operate a U.S.-based business with concentrated sales to the State of Michigan for our Document Conversion segment, complemented by our diverse set of document management software solutions and services. We hold or compete for leading positions regionally in select markets and attribute this leadership to several factors including the strength of our brand name and reputation, our comprehensive offering of innovative solutions, and the quality of our service support. Net growth in sales of software as a service in recent years reflects market demand for these solutions over traditional sales of on-premise software. We expect to continue to benefit from our select niche leadership market positions, innovative product offering, growing customer base, and the impact of our sales and marketing programs. Examples of these programs include identifying and investing in growth and expanded market penetration opportunities, more effective products and services pricing strategies, demonstrating superior value to customers, increasing our sales force effectiveness through improved guidance and measurement, and continuing to optimize our lead generation and lead nurturing processes.
 
Software and Services
 
Document Management
 
Our flagship software platform suite is IntelliCloud™, reflecting our focus, and the market’s focus, on growth via cloud-based content management and process automation. Our Document Management business also generates software-related professional services that include installation, integration, training, and consulting services, as well as ongoing software maintenance and customer support.

-

 

The IntelliCloud™ suite of software is comprised of stand-alone and integrated modules that include:
 

● | Image Processing: includes image processing modules used for capturing, transforming and managing images of paper documents, including support of distributed and high-volume capture, optical character recognition; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Records Management: addresses needs relating to retention of content through automation and policies, ensuring legal, regulatory and industry compliance for our clients; 
● | Workflow: supports business processes, routing content electronically for assigning work tasks and approvals, and creating related audit trails, notifications, and escalations; and 
● | Extended Components: includes document composition and e-forms (via third party OEM integration partnership), search, content and web analytics (via third party data visualization and advanced OCR engine partnerships), email and information archiving, packaged application integration, and advanced capture for invoice processing, and accounts payable lifecycle automation. 

Document Conversion
 
We convert images from paper to digital, paper to microfilm, microfiche to microfilm, and micrographics to digital for business and federal, county, and municipal governments. Our Document Conversion business also provides its clients with long-term paper and microfilm storage and retrieval options.
 
The primary Document Conversion offerings are:
 

● | Digital Scanning Services. These services include paper scanning, newspaper and microfilm scanning, microfiche scanning, aperture card scanning, drawing scanning, and book scanning. Most government files must be retained for long terms or permanently, making such clients a prime candidate for digital conversion. There are four production categories for these services, consisting of document prep, scanning, indexing, and delivery. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Business Process Outsourcing (BPO). BPO contracts provide ongoing outsourcing of customer processes such as mail room activities, where we pick up customer mail from the post office, open it, sort it, scan it, and upload it to the appropriate customer system. 
● | Microfilm and Microfiche. We provide microfilming/microfiche conversion to digital, converting scanned images to microfilm or microfiche, and microfilm/microfiche preservation and duplication. 
● | Box Storage Services. We provide physical document storage and retrieval services for our clients. 
● | Scanning Equipment, Software and Repair. We sell and service document image software, document scanners, and microfilm scanners, readers and printers. This is a smaller, slowly declining part of our Document Conversion business. 

Marketing and Sales
 
We have a multi-channel sales model that directs our sales efforts through direct sales and through intermediaries, such as independent software vendors, resellers and referral partners. Our Document Management and Document Conversion segments each use direct and reseller channels for sales. We have developed partner-specific marketing programs with channel partners. We believe that our channel partner strategy improvements have increased the competitive strength of our platform of products. In addition, we have established a set of business solutions templates for specific vertical markets that provide base software configurations which we believe will facilitate our delivery and installation of software to our customers in both our direct and reseller channels. We believe that these advancements, in the aggregate, will allow us to license and sell our products to a targeted customer base, shortening our sales cycle, making margins more consistent, and allowing us to expand our sales through existing and new reseller partnerships and direct customers. We continue to devote significant efforts, in both development and marketing, in enhancing all channels to market.

Competition and Market Position
 
The market for our products is competitive, and we expect that competition will continue to intensify as the document solutions markets evolve and potentially consolidate. We believe that the trend toward electronic document management, and particularly cloud solutions, was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
We believe the primary competitors of our Document Management segment are DocuWare, Square 9, M-files, On-Base, FileBound, and Laserfiche, who also serve small-to-medium business (SMB) and governmental sectors. The principal competitive factors affecting the market for our document conversion services include: (i) vendor and product reputation; (ii) product quality, performance and price; (iii) the availability of software products on multiple platforms; (iv) product scalability; (v) product integration with other enterprise applications; (vi) software functionality and features; (vii) software ease of use; (viii) the quality of professional services, customer support services and training; and (ix) the ability to address specific customer business problems. We believe that the relative importance of each of these factors depends upon the concerns and needs of each specific customer.
 
We believe the competitors of our Document Conversion segment vary from small, niche entities to larger entities, including Iron Mountain. The principal competitive factors affecting the market for our software products and services include: (i) vendor and services reputation and (ii) services quality, performance and price. We believe that the relative importance of each of these factors depends upon the concerns and needs of each specific customer, and that, for our current and prospective customers, maintaining secure control over the customers’ information is highly valued.
 
We believe that the consolidated Company has advantages over our competitors in the small-to-medium business market, and particularly organizations in highly regulated, risk and compliance-intensive markets, such as state and local government, non-clinical health care, and K-12 education. In our view, we will remain competitive by remaining a focused niche provider with product offerings aligned with buyer-specific requirements. We anticipate that we will benefit from five specific advantages already in place:
 

● | Turnkey cloud or premise document workflow and document conversion solutions targeting specific industry customers with benchmark value-to-price ratio; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Rigorous quality review process and maintenance of customer data confidentiality in document conversions; 
● | Modular solution packaging and rapid customer activation model; 
● | Integrated on-demand solutions library as standard platform feature; and 
● | Expanded software integration tools that make it easier for independent software vendors to integrate and sell IntelliCloud software capabilities into their customer base. 

 
We believe, with these competitive strengths, that we are well positioned as a cloud-based managed document services provider for the small-to-medium business and governmental sectors.
 
Customers
 
Document Management
 
For 2021, the two largest customers of our Document Management segment accounted for approximately 10% and 4%, respectively, of the segment’s revenues for that period. For 2020, the two largest customers of our Document Management segment accounted for approximately 6% and 4%, respectively, of the segment’s revenues for that period.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, government contracts represented approximately 30% and 37%, respectively, of the Document Management segment’s net revenues, including a significant portion of the segment’s sales to resellers which represent ultimate sales to government agencies. Due to their dependence on state, local and federal budgets, government contracts carry short terms, typically 12 months. Since our inception, our contracts with government customers have generally renewed on the original terms and conditions upon expiration.

Document Conversion
 
Our Document Conversion segment has significant customer concentration with the State of Michigan. Graphic Sciences’ contract with the State of Michigan is for five years from June 1, 2018 to May 30, 2023 with a provision for two, one-year extensions. The contract is issued to Graphic Sciences through the Michigan Department of Management and Budget, Enterprise Procurement and managed through the Department of Management and Budget, Records Management Services Division (RMS).
 
The contract provides local and state government agencies access to digital and micrographic conversion services. These agencies have the option to perform these conversion services internally or go out to bid if they so choose. Typically, they elect to have these services outsourced to Graphic Sciences through RMS, which eliminates the bidding process.
 
All Michigan agencies and departments are able to use the services and prices provided under this contract. Mechanically, the work we perform is invoiced to RMS and the end user is invoiced through the State of Michigan accounting system. We do not invoice the end user directly when entities utilize this contract facility, and we have a single point of contact for managing billing and receipt. The state in effect acts as a reseller of our services to the other agencies and makes a mark-up of what is charged. For 2021, the State of Michigan represented approximately 64% of our Document Conversion segment’s net revenues, and 47% of the total consolidated revenues. For 2020, the State of Michigan represented approximately 71% of our Document Conversion segment’s net revenues, and 47% of the total consolidated revenues.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our software and most of the underlying technologies are built on a Microsoft.Net framework. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark laws, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary intellectual property rights.
 
Customers license the right to use our software products on a non-exclusive basis. We grant to third parties rights in our intellectual property that allow them to market certain of our products on a non-exclusive or limited-scope exclusive basis for a particular application of the product or to a particular geographic area.
 
While we believe that our intellectual property as a whole is valuable and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success, we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular trademark, license, or other intellectual property right.
 
Software Development
 
We design, develop, test, market, license, and support new software products and enhancements of current products. We continuously monitor our software products and enhancements to remain compatible with standard platforms and file formats. We discuss our accounting for such costs, and when we expense or capitalize, in more detail below in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our business. Other than government procurement rules affecting sales to governmental customers, we do not believe that we are subject to any special governmental regulations or approval requirements affecting our products or services. Complying with the regulations and requirements applicable to our business does not entail a significant cost or burden. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations.

Human Capital
 
As of March 21, 2021, we employed a total of 104 individuals; all but 11 are full-time employees. Graphic Sciences employs 81 individuals, comprised of 75 full-time and 6 part-time employees, all located in Michigan. Graphic Sciences also utilizes temporary employees, through various agencies, to provide labor for variable project work. Intellinetics Ohio employs 23 individuals, comprised of 17 full-time and 5 part-time employees, primarily located in Ohio. As a combined company, 14 of our employees work in administration and management, 19 of our employees work in software sales, maintenance and support, and software development, and 71 of our employees work in document services and storage operations.


We consider the integrity, experience, dedication, creativity, and team-oriented nature of our employees to be an essential driver of our business and a key to our future prospects. Personal relationships with our existing customers are an important part of our business, and our customers have come to rely on the personal service and knowledge of our workforce across all functional areas. To attract and retain qualified applicants to our company and retain our employees, we offer total benefits packages consisting of base salary or hourly wage (depending on position), a comprehensive benefits package, and equity compensation for certain employees. Annual cash bonuses are based on our profitability, achievement of targets and level of responsibility. When selecting talent, we consider education, experience, diversity, and the likelihood that a candidate will espouse our values of integrity, collaboration, dedication, creativity, and superior customer service.
 
We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce that attracts and retains exceptional talent. In addition, we pride ourselves on an open culture that respects co-workers, values employees’ health and well-being and fosters professional development. We support employee growth and development in a variety of ways including with training opportunities and an overall strategy of promotion from within. Our management conducts annual employee engagement surveys and, for supervisors and above, annual individual employee assessments with an emphasis on individual development for each employee.
 
We remain focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees with respect to COVID-19. In April of 2020, we instituted safe distancing practices and additional cleaning procedures for all company offices and facilities, and our offices in Michigan and Ohio were reconfigured to maintain physical distancing. Wherever feasible, we have encouraged employees to work from home. To date, our employees who work in software sales, maintenance and support, and software development continue to work remotely. Our remote working arrangements have not significantly affected our ability to maintain critical business operations.
 
We believe that relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we do not have collective bargaining arrangements with any of our employees. In addition, as of March 21, 2021, we engaged four independent contractors.
