Overview 
 TripAdvisor is an online travel company and our mission is to help people around the world to plan, book and experience the perfect trip. We seek to achieve our mission by providing users and travel partners a global platform about destinations, accommodations, activities and attractions, and restaurants that includes rich user-generated content, price comparison tools and online reservation and related services.
 TripAdvisor, Inc., by and through its subsidiaries, owns and operates a portfolio of leading online travel brands. Our flagship brand, TripAdvisor, is the world’s largest travel site based on monthly unique visitors, with 455 million average monthly unique visitors in our seasonal peak during the year ended December 31, 2017, according to our internal log files. 
 Our TripAdvisor-branded websites include tripadvisor.com in the United States and localized versions of the TripAdvisor website in 48 markets and 28 languages worldwide. TripAdvisor features approximately 600 million reviews and opinions on approximately 7.5 million places to stay, places to eat and things to do – including approximately 1.2 million hotels, inns, B&Bs and specialty lodging, 750,000 vacation rentals, 4.6 million restaurants and 915,000 activities and attractions worldwide. We also enable users to compare prices and/or book a number of these travel experiences on either a TripAdvisor site or mobile app, or on the site or app of one of our travel partners.
 In addition to the flagship TripAdvisor brand, we manage and operate the following 20 other travel media brands, connected by the common goal of providing users the most comprehensive travel-planning and trip-taking resources in the travel industry: www.airfarewatchdog.com, www.bookingbuddy.com, www.citymaps.com, www.cruisecritic.com, www.familyvacationcritic.com, www.flipkey.com, www.thefork.com (including www.lafourchette.com, www.eltenedor.com, www.iens.nl, and www.dimmi.com.au), www.gateguru.com, www.holidaylettings.co.uk, www.holidaywatchdog.com, www.housetrip.com, www.jetsetter.com, www.niumba.com, www.onetime.com, www.oyster.com, www.seatguru.com, www.smartertravel.com, www.tingo.com, www.vacationhomerentals.com, and www.viator.com. 
 Our Industry and Market Opportunity 
 We operate in the global travel industry, focusing exclusively on online travel activity and the online advertising market.
 According to Phocuswright, an independent travel, tourism and hospitality research firm, global travel spending is expected to be greater than $1.6 trillion in 2018. Online penetration of global travel bookings currently is estimated to be less than 50%, however, travel bookings continue to move online as consumers around the world gain access to the internet, including broadband; more users continue to access the internet via mobile devices; and global tourism activity continues to increase, driven by middle class and economic growth in some parts of the world. In addition, the internet provides greater access to travel research and booking capabilities than offline methods. Given the ongoing consumer trends around online travel media consumption and online travel commerce, we believe travel partners will continue to allocate greater percentages of their marketing budgets to online channels, as they seek to grow their businesses.
Our Business Model 
 Our businesses help to match demand – users who seek to discover, research, price compare and book the best travel experiences – with supply – our travel partners who provide travel accommodations, travel experiences and travel services, worldwide. 
Users
 We serve users through our websites and apps and focus on content, selection, price, and convenience. TripAdvisor features approximately 600 million user-generated reviews and opinions across a broad base of global

travel-related businesses, including approximately 1.2 million hotels, inns, B&Bs and specialty lodging, 750,000 vacation rentals, 4.6 million restaurants and 915,000 activities and attractions worldwide. Our content – and the strong global brand we have created since our founding in 2000 – are primary drivers of not only attracting the world’s largest travel audience of 455 million unique monthly visitors but also influencing a significant amount of travel commerce. We are focused on creating the best online experience in travel planning and booking, making it easier for users to research destinations and experiences, to read and contribute user-generated content, compare destinations and businesses based on quality, price and availability, and to complete bookings powered by our travel partners. 
 Travel Partners
 We strive to give users more choice and to help users find the best experiences and the best deals possible and we design our websites to enable our travel partners to be discovered, to advertise and to sell their services. We facilitate transactions between users and travel partners in a number of ways, including by sending referrals to our partners websites, facilitating bookings on behalf of our partners, by serving as the merchant of record – as is often the case in our attractions and vacation rentals businesses – and by offering advertising placements on our websites and mobile apps.
Segments and Products
 We manage our business in two reportable segments: Hotel and Non-Hotel. We continue to derive a significant majority of our revenue from our Hotel segment, which accounted for 77%, 80%, and 85%, of our consolidated revenue in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Hotel segment includes revenue generated from the following sources:

• | TripAdvisor-branded Click-based and Transaction Revenue. Our largest source of Hotel segment revenue is generated from click-based advertising on TripAdvisor-branded websites, which is primarily comprised of contextually-relevant booking links to our travel partners’ sites. Our click-based advertising travel partners are predominantly online travel agencies, or OTAs, and direct suppliers in the hotel product category. Click-based advertising is generally priced on a cost-per-click, or “CPC”, basis, with payments from advertisers determined by the number of users who click on a link multiplied by the price that partner is willing to pay for that click, or hotel shopper lead. CPC rates are determined in a dynamic, competitive auction process, or metasearch auction, that enables our partners to use our proprietary, automated bidding system to submit CPC bids to have their hotel rates and availability listed on our site. Transaction revenue is generated from our instant booking feature, which enables the merchant of record, generally an OTA or hotel partner, to pay a commission to TripAdvisor for a user that completes a hotel reservation via our website.

• | TripAdvisor-branded Display-based Advertising and Subscription Revenue. Travel partners can promote their brands in a contextually-relevant manner through a variety of display-based advertising placements on our websites. Our display-based advertising clients are predominantly direct suppliers of hotels, airlines and cruises, as well as destination marketing organizations. We also sell display-based advertising to OTAs and other travel-related businesses, and to advertisers from non-travel categories. Display-based advertising is sold predominantly on a cost per thousand impressions, or CPM, basis. In addition, we offer subscription-based advertising to hotels, B&Bs and other specialty lodging properties. Subscription advertising is predominantly sold for a flat fee and enables subscribers to enhance their listing, for a contracted period of time, on our TripAdvisor-branded websites, including by posting special offers for travelers.

• | Other Hotel Revenue. Our other hotel revenue primarily includes revenue from non-TripAdvisor branded websites, such as www.bookingbuddy.com, www.cruisecritic.com, and www.onetime.com, which includes click-based advertising revenue, display-based advertising revenue, hotel room reservations sold through the websites and advertising revenue from making cruise reservations available for price comparison and booking.

In recent years, a significant percentage of our user traffic as well as an increasing percentage of our consolidated revenue has come from Non-Hotel products – attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals. These businesses generate revenue in our Non-Hotel segment, which accounted for 23%, 20%, and 15% of our consolidated revenue in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
  
• | Attractions. We provide information and services for users to research, book, and experience activities and attractions in popular travel destinations both through Viator, our dedicated Attractions business, and on our TripAdvisor website and applications. We primarily generate commissions for each transaction we facilitate through our online reservation systems. In addition to its consumer-direct business, Viator also powers activity and attractions booking capabilities for its affiliate partners, including some of the world’s top airlines, hotel chains and online and offline travel agencies. We enable users to book approximately 83,000 activities and attractions, via third-party suppliers, which are available on Viator-branded websites and mobile applications and on TripAdvisor-branded websites and mobile applications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Restaurants. We provide information and services for users to research and book restaurants in popular travel destinations through our dedicated restaurant reservations business, TheFork, and on our TripAdvisor website and applications. TheFork is an online restaurant booking platform operating on a number of websites (including www.lafourchette.com, www.eltenedor.com, www.iens.nl and www.dimmi.com.au), with a network of restaurant partners located primarily across Europe and Australia. We generate reservation revenues that are paid by restaurants for diners seated through TheFork’s online reservation systems, and generate subscription fees for our online booking and marketing analytics tools provided by TheFork and by TripAdvisor. We enable users to book approximately 46,000 restaurants, which are available on www.thefork.com and on TripAdvisor-branded websites and mobile applications.

• | Vacation Rentals. We provide information and services for users to research and book vacation and short-term rental properties, including full home rentals, condominiums, villas, beach rentals, cabins and cottages. The Vacation Rentals business generates revenue primarily by offering individual property owners and property managers the ability to list their properties on our websites and mobile applications thereby connecting homeowners with travelers through a free-to-list, commission-based option and, to a lesser extent, by an annual subscription-based fee structure. These properties are listed on www.flipkey.com, www.holidaylettings.co.uk, www.housetrip.com, www.niumba.com, and www.vacationhomerentals.com, and on our TripAdvisor-branded websites and mobile applications.

Our Long-Term Growth Strategy 
           We seek to achieve our mission of helping people around the world plan, book and experience the perfect trip by: leveraging our user-generated content and global brand to attract users to our websites and applications; providing users with the best user experience throughout all phases of the travel journey; deepening our partnerships with travel partners, by providing them with a global platform of advertising opportunities to generate qualified leads and bookings; and investing in technology, product development, marketing, and other strategic areas that we believe can improve our long-term business prospects.

• | Drive user engagement with our platform. Since our founding, the TripAdvisor brand has become a globally-recognized travel brand, one that is synonymous with travel reviews and research and increasingly finding the best prices and booking. We believe that our user-generated content and our brand have enabled us to build a large, highly engaged and loyal community of travelers who view TripAdvisor as a valuable resource to help them discover, plan and, book their travel experiences, and for millions of users, TripAdvisor gives them an interactive platform to share their travel experiences. We seek to amplify our global brand and raise user awareness for and engagement with our expanded product offerings as we aim to attract users to our websites and applications through various channels, including domain direct and various online and offline marketing channels, including search engines through search engine optimization and search engine marketing, and recently, through television brand advertising.

• | Deliver the best user experience possible on our platform. We believe that giving users more value throughout their TripAdvisor experience is key to our future success. To accomplish this, we have

made and will continue to make product improvements in order to provide a more enjoyable and engaging end-to-end user experience throughout all phases of the travel journey – from inspiration and discovery, to researching, price shopping and booking, to in-destination activities and places to eat, and, finally, to sharing the details of these travel experiences on TripAdvisor. These enhancements include having grown the number of hotels, inns, B&Bs and specialty lodging, vacation rentals, restaurants, activities and attractions listed on our platform to approximately 7.5 million worldwide as of December 31, 2017. In addition to listings and content, we have provided users more options to price compare and book their travel experiences. During 2017, we launched a more engaging hotel shopping experience that focused on helping hotel shoppers find the best prices on TripAdvisor websites and applications. In order to better serve travelers needs when they are in-destination, we have continued to rapidly expand our bookable supply in attractions and restaurants. We believe that our continued focus on delivering an increasingly more robust user experience will ultimately result in more repeat usage on our platform, more value for our partners, and greater monetization for our business. We seek to quickly identify what users need to conduct their travel research and booking and to deliver product enhancements quickly.

• | Deepen relationships with our travel partners. We are a global platform consisting of listing and advertising opportunities that help generate impressions, brand awareness, qualified leads and bookings for travel partners. As of December 31, 2017, TripAdvisor had approximately 1.2 million hotels, inns, B&Bs and specialty lodging, 915,000 activities and attractions, 4.6 million restaurants, and 750,000 vacation rentals on its website. We believe that continuing to grow the number of listings and bookable supply, especially in our in-destination Attractions and Restaurants businesses, will enable TripAdvisor to not only delight users in more moments during more trips, but also help partners drive transactions for their business. We are also increasingly providing business-to-business services that are designed to help our partners grow their business. For example, TripAdvisor’s Business Advantage and Premium for Restaurants offer hoteliers and restauranteurs, affordable marketing and business analytics tools, respectively, to help them attract customers and more effectively manage their business pages on TripAdvisor.

• | Invest in technology, product, marketing and other strategic areas. Continuous product testing and speed to market are two of our most important priorities, as they enable us to create a richer user experience. We operate on a regular product release cycle, where releases contain new product features for our websites and mobile applications. For example, innovating and improving our mobile phone offerings are key priorities since mobile phone adoption continues to scale and consumers increasingly conduct more internet searches and commerce on these devices. During the year ended December 31, 2017, more than half of our average monthly unique visitors came from mobile phones, growing nearly 30% year-over-year, according to our internal log files. We anticipate that the growth rate in mobile phone monthly unique visitors will continue to exceed the growth rate of our overall monthly unique visitors, resulting in an increased proportion of users continuing to use their mobile phones to access the full range of services available on our websites and applications. We are investing significant resources to improve the features, functionality, engagement, and commercialization of our travel products on our mobile websites and applications.

 Marketing
We seek to amplify our global brand and raise user awareness and engagement for our expanded product offerings as we aim to attract users to our websites and applications through various channels, including domain direct and various online and offline marketing channels, including search engines (primarily Google), social media, and in more recent years, through television brand advertising. Both our performance advertising expense and brand advertising expense have increased in recent years. During 2017, our total advertising expense was approximately $629 million, primarily related to the use of online search engines (primarily Google), social media, as well as offline marketing, primarily television advertising, as part of our ongoing initiative to attract users to our websites and applications when they are looking to find the best hotel deals before they are ready to book. We intend to continue a strategy of promoting brand awareness through both online and offline advertising efforts, including by expanding brand campaigns into additional markets.

Competition 
 We compete in rapidly evolving and competitive markets. We face competition for content, users, advertisers, online travel search and price comparison services also known in the industry as hotel metasearch, and online reservations. In the competition to attract users to our platform, we rely on our ability to acquire traffic through offline brand recognition and brand-direct efforts such as online search, email and television. These marketing strategies can be impacted by competitive site content, changes to our website architecture and page designs, changes to search engine ranking algorithms, updates in competitor advertising strategies, or changes to display ordering in search engine results such as preferred placement for internal products offered by search engines.
 We compete with different types of companies in the various markets and geographies we participate in, including large and small companies in the travel space as well as broader service providers. More specifically:
  
• | In our Hotel segment, we both partner with, and face competition from OTAs (including Expedia, Inc. and The Priceline Group, Inc. and many of their respective subsidiaries and operating companies); hotel metasearch providers (including trivago, a subsidiary of Expedia, Kayak, a subsidiary of Priceline, HotelsCombined and Ctrip.com International, Ltd); large online search, social media, and marketplace platforms and companies (including Google, Facebook, Microsoft’s Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, Alibaba, and Amazon); traditional offline travel agencies; and global hotel chains seeking to promote direct bookings.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In our Non-Hotel segment, our Attractions business competes with both traditional and online travel agencies, online travel service providers, wholesalers, and individual tour operators. Our Restaurants business competes with other online restaurant reservation services, such as Yelp and OpenTable (a subsidiary of Priceline), and local or regional providers. Our Vacation Rentals business competes with companies focused on alternative lodging and shared accommodations, including Airbnb and HomeAway (a subsidiary of Expedia) and booking.com (a subsidiary of Priceline).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As the industry continues to shift towards online travel services and the technology supporting it continues to evolve, we anticipate that the existing competitive landscape will continue to change, new competitors may emerge, and industry consolidation may continue. 
 Commercial Relationships 
 We have a number of commercial relationships that are important to the success of our business. Although these relationships are memorialized in agreements, many of these agreements are for limited terms or are terminable at will or on short notice. As a result, we work hard to ensure the mutual success of these relationships. 
 We have commercial relationships with the majority of the world’s leading OTAs, as well as a variety of other travel partners pursuant to which these companies primarily purchase traveler leads from us, generally on a click-based advertising basis. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our two most significant travel partners were Expedia and Priceline, including certain of their respective brands. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, Expedia (and its subsidiaries) and Priceline (and its subsidiaries), each accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue and together accounted for approximately 43%, 46% and 46% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. Nearly all of this concentration of revenue is recorded in our Hotel segment for these reporting periods. 
 Operations and Technology 
 We have assembled a team of highly skilled software engineers, computer scientists, data scientists, network engineers, and systems engineers whose expertise spans a broad range of technical areas, including a wide variety of open source operating systems, databases, languages, analytics, networking, scalable web architecture, operations, and warehousing technologies. We make significant investments in product and feature development, data management, personalization technologies, scalable infrastructures, networking, data warehousing, and search engine technologies. 
 Our systems infrastructure, web and database servers for TripAdvisor-branded websites are housed at two geographically separate facilities and have multiple communication links as well as continuous monitoring and 
 
6


engineering support. Each facility is fully self-sufficient and operational with its own hardware, networking, software, and content, and is structured in an active/passive, fully redundant configuration. Substantially all of our software components, data, and content are replicated in multiple datacenters and development centers, as well as being backed up at offsite locations. Our systems are monitored and protected though multiple layers of security. Several of our individual subsidiaries and businesses, including Viator, have their own data infrastructure and technology teams. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, proprietary technology and trade secrets, is an important component of our business. We rely on our intellectual property rights in our content, proprietary technology, software code, ratings indexes, databases of reviews and forum content. We have acquired some of our intellectual property rights through licenses and content agreements with third parties and these arrangements may place restrictions on the use of our intellectual property. 
 We protect our intellectual property by relying on our terms of use, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions, as well as on international, national, state and common law rights. We protect our brands by pursuing the trademark registration of our core brands, as appropriate, maintaining our trademark portfolio, securing contractual trademark rights protection when appropriate, and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate. We also register copyrights and domain names as deemed appropriate. Additionally, we protect our trademarks, domain names and copyrights with the use of intellectual property licenses and an enforcement program. 
 We have considered, and will continue to consider, the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions, as circumstances may warrant. However, many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us. 
 Government Regulation 
 We are subject to a number of United States federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet, many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These includes laws and regulations regarding user privacy, libel, rights of publicity, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, taxation, online payment services, competition and protection of minors. In particular, we are subject to United States federal and state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of user data. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. United States federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations is often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving industry in which we operate. 
 In addition, we provide advertising data and information and conduct marketing activities that are subject to United States federal and state consumer protection laws that regulate unfair and deceptive practices, domestically and internationally. The United States and European Union have begun to adopt legislation that regulates certain aspects of the internet, including online editorial and user-generated content, data privacy, behavioral targeting and online advertising, taxation, and liability for third-party activities. It is impossible to accurately predict whether new taxes or regulations will be imposed on our services, and whether or how we might be affected. Increased regulation of the internet could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operational results. 
 We are subject to laws that require protection of user privacy and user data. In our processing of reservations, we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable data in the United States, Europe and Asia. This data is increasingly subject to laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, including the European Union through the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The enactment, interpretation and application of these laws is in a state of flux, and the interpretation and application of such laws may vary from country to country.

Corporate History, Equity Ownership and Voting Control
 TripAdvisor was co-founded in February 2000 by Stephen Kaufer, our current Chief Executive Officer and President. In April 2004, TripAdvisor was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp, or IAC. In August 2005, IAC spun-off its portfolio of travel brands, including TripAdvisor, into a separate newly-formed Delaware corporation called Expedia, Inc., or Expedia. On December 20, 2011 Expedia completed a spin-off of TripAdvisor into a separate publicly-traded Delaware corporation. We refer to this second spin-off transaction as the “Spin-Off.” Following the Spin-Off, on December 21, 2011, TripAdvisor began trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, or NASDAQ, as an independent public company under the trading symbol “TRIP.”
 On December 11, 2012, Liberty Interactive Corporation, or Liberty, purchased an aggregate of approximately 4.8 million shares of common stock of TripAdvisor from Barry Diller, our former Chairman of the Board of Directors and Senior Executive, and certain of his affiliates. As a result, Liberty beneficially owned approximately 18.2 million shares of our common stock and 12.8 million shares of our Class B common stock. 
 On August 27, 2014, the entire beneficial ownership of our common stock and Class B common stock held by Liberty was acquired by Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc., or LTRIP. Simultaneously, Liberty, LTRIP’s former parent company, distributed, by means of a dividend, to the holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock, Liberty’s entire equity interest in LTRIP. We refer to this transaction as the “Liberty Spin-Off”. As a result of the Liberty Spin-Off, effective August 27, 2014, LTRIP became a separate, publicly traded company holding 100% of Liberty’s interest in TripAdvisor. 
 As a result of these transactions, as of December 31, 2017, LTRIP beneficially owned approximately 18.2 million shares of our common stock and 12.8 million shares of our Class B common stock, which constitute 14.4% of the outstanding shares of common stock and 100% of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Assuming the conversion of all of LTRIP’s shares of Class B common stock into common stock, LTRIP would beneficially own 22.3% of the outstanding common stock. Because each share of Class B common stock generally is entitled to ten votes per share and each share of common stock is entitled to one vote per share, LTRIP may be deemed to beneficially own equity securities representing 57.5% of our voting power.
 Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Information 
 Our reporting structure includes two reportable segments: Hotel and Non-Hotel. Our Non-Hotel reportable segment consists of three operating segments, which includes our Attractions, Restaurants and Vacation Rentals businesses. The segments are determined based on how the chief operating decision maker regularly assesses information and evaluates performance for operating decision-making purposes, including allocation of resources. Financial information related to our two reportable segments and geographic information required herein is contained in “Note 17 — Segment and Geographic Information,” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 
 Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 3,228 employees. Of these employees, approximately 51% were based in the United States. We believe we have good relationships with our employees, including relationships with employees represented by international works councils or other similar organizations.  
Seasonality 
 Traveler expenditures in the global travel market tend to follow a seasonal pattern. As such, expenditures by travel partners/advertisers to market to potential travelers and, thereby, our financial performance, or revenue and profits, tend to be seasonal as well. As a result, our financial performance tends to be seasonally highest in the second and third quarters of a year, as it is a key period for leisure travel research and trip-taking, which includes the seasonal peak in traveler hotel and vacation rental stays, and tours and attractions taken, compared to the first and fourth quarters which represent seasonal low points. Further significant shifts in our business mix or adverse economic conditions could result in future seasonal patterns that are different from historical trends.
