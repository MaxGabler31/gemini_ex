Industry Overview
 
Esports is the competitive playing of video games by amateur and professional teams for cash prizes. Esports typically takes the form of organized, multiplayer video games that include real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena games. Esports also includes games which can be played, primarily by amateurs, in multiplayer competitions on the Sony PlayStation®, Microsoft Xbox® and WII Nintendo® systems.
 
Although official competitions have long been a part of video game culture, participation and spectatorship of such events have seen a global surge in popularity over the last few years with the rapid growth of online streaming. The advent of online streaming technology has turned esports into a global industry that includes professional players and teams competing in major events that are simultaneously watched in person in stadiums, and by online viewers, which regularly exceed 1,000,000 viewers for major tournaments. According to the Sports Business Journal, the 2022 League of Legends® World Championships had peak concurrent viewership of more than 73 million online. Much like how there is a worldwide gaming market for the sports industry, there has now developed a worldwide gaming market for the esports industry. The impact has been so significant that many video game developers are now building features into their games designed to facilitate competition.

Business Overview
 
We are a global esports organization, that is capitalizing on the growth in esports through two business units: Simplicity Esports, LLC (“Simplicity Esports LLC”) and PLAYlive Nation, Inc. (“PLAYlive”). During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, we also had a third business unit: Simplicity One Brasil Ltda (“Simplicity One”). During the first quarter of the fiscal year ending May 31, 2023, in an effort to focus on business operations that were currently profitable, the Company sold its League of Legends franchise asset, and exited business operations in Brazil. Funding the Brazilian business operations created a monthly cash burn of approximately $45,000. The Company sold the franchise asset to Brazilian esports organization Los Grandes for total consideration of 1,920,000 Brazilian Reais (approximately $362,000) to be paid in five equal quarterly installments.
Our Esports Teams
 
We own and manage multiple professional esports teams. Revenue is generated from prize winnings, corporate sponsorships, advertising, league subsidy payments and potential league revenue sharing payments from the publishers of video games.
 
Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Simplicity Esports LLC, we own and manage multiple professional esports teams competing in games such as Heroes of the Storm. We are committed to growing and enhancing the esports industry, fostering the development of amateurs to compete professionally and signing established professional gamers to support their paths to greater success.
 
In addition, from January 2020 to July 2022, we managed Flamengo eSports, one of the leading Brazilian League of Legends® teams competing in the top tier league CBLoL, through our 76% owned subsidiary, Simplicity One. In July 2022, in an effort to focus on business operations that were currently profitable, the Company sold its League of Legends franchise asset, and exited business operations in Brazil. Funding the Brazilian business operations created a monthly cash burn of approximately $45,000. The Company sold the franchise asset to Brazilian esports organization Los Grandes for total consideration of 1,920,000 Brazilian Reais (approximately $362,000) to be paid in five equal quarterly installments.

Online Tournaments
 
In response to demand from customers for online esports tournaments which was likely triggered by the social distancing protocols attendant to the COVID-19 pandemic, we introduced in March 2020 an initiative of online esports tournaments. Since March 2020, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Simplicity Esports LLC, we had been holding online esports tournaments in the United States. As of August 2022, we have temporarily ceased organizing online tournaments while focusing on expense reduction and operational efficiency.
Our Gaming Centers
 
As of May 31, 2022, we had 29 operational locations (17 corporate locations and 12 franchise locations), through our subsidiaries throughout the U.S., giving casual gamers the opportunity to play in a social setting with other members of the gaming community. Subsequent to the 2022 fiscal year end, the Company closed 12 of its 17 corporate owned esports gaming center locations. The Company continues to operate five corporate owned locations and 12 franchisee owned locations. Management is exploring strategic alternatives, including merger and acquisition opportunities, and is focused on high margin, lower capital expenditure business strategies in the esports gaming industry, with a goal of being cash flow positive in the next 12 to 24 months.
 
In addition, aspiring and established professional gamers have an opportunity to compete in local and national esports tournaments held in our gaming centers for prizes, notoriety, and potential contracts to play for one of our professional esports teams. In this business unit, revenue is generated from franchise royalties, the sale of game time, memberships, tournament entry fees, birthday party events, corporate party events, concessions and gaming-related merchandise.
 
Our business plan encompasses a brick-and-click physical and digital approach to further recognize revenue from all verticals, which we believe to be unique in the industry. The physical centers, together with our esports teams, lifestyle brand and marketing campaigns offer opportunities for additional revenue via strategic partnerships with both endemic and non-endemic brands. Our ultimate goal is to further engage a diverse fan base with a 360-degree approach driving traffic to both our digital platform, tournaments (online and in-person), and physical real estate to maximize the monetization opportunities with these relationships. In addition, we have proprietary intellectual capital, fan engagement strategies and brand development blueprints which complement our publicly available information.
 
Optimally, the esports gaming centers of Simplicity Esports LLC (“Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers”) measure between 2,000 and 4,000 square feet, with dozens of gaming stations. The Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers feature cutting edge technology, futuristic aesthetic décor and dynamic high-speed gaming equipment. We believe our brick-and-click strategy will present attractive opportunities for sponsors and advertisers to connect with our audience, creating an intriguing monetization opportunity for sponsors and advertisers. As of September 26, 2022, our corporate owned stores operate in approximately 40,000 square feet of retail space in desirable, high traffic locations.

Creating content that engages fans, sponsors and developers, while promoting our brand is one of our primary goals. In August 2021, we announced a partnership with Television Korea 24 (“ESTV”) to provide esports and gaming content for their 24-7 live linear channel around the world. ESTV can be viewed in over 45 countries, including the U.S. We seek to reach a broad demographic encompassing the casual, amateur and professional gaming community. Our philosophy is to enhance our footprint for both endemic and non-endemic partnerships. We believe we possess a deep perception of our markets and understand the new age of branding while maintaining authenticity to the gaming community that comprises our fanbase.
 
As a result of COVID-19 (discussed below), all of our corporate and franchised Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers were closed effective April 1, 2020. We commenced reopening Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers on May 1, 2020 and subsequently reopened 16 corporate and 12 franchised Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers. Subsequent to the 2022 fiscal year end, the Company closed 12 of its 17 corporate owned esports gaming center locations. The Company continues to operate five corporate owned locations and 12 franchisee owned locations. See “Risk Factors—Public health epidemics or outbreaks, such as COVID-19, could materially and adversely impact our business.”
 
Corporate Gaming Centers 
 
As of May 31, 2022, we operated 17 corporate-owned retail Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers. Subsequent to the 2022 fiscal year end, the Company closed 12 of its 17 corporate owned esports gaming center locations. The Company continues to operate five  corporate owned locations and 12 franchisee owned locations. Management is exploring strategic alternatives, including merger and acquisition opportunities, and is focused on high margin, lower capital expenditure business strategies in the esports gaming industry, with a goal of being cash flow positive in the next 12 to 24 months.
Franchised Gaming Centers
 
Due to interest from potential franchisees, in 2019 we launched a franchising program to accelerate the expansion of our planned nationwide footprint. We sell specific franchise territories, through our wholly owned subsidiary PLAYlive, and assist with the establishment and buildout of esports gaming centers to potential business owners that desire to use our branding, infrastructure and process to open and operate gaming centers. We currently operate 12 fully constructed franchise esports gaming centers. Franchise revenue is generated from the sale of franchise territories, supplying furniture, equipment and merchandise to the franchisees for buildout of their centers, a gross sales royalty fee and a national marketing fee. We license the use of our branding, assist in identifying and negotiating commercial locations, assist in overseeing the buildout and development, provide access to proprietary software for point of sale, inventory management, employee training and other HR functions. Franchisees also have an opportunity to participate in our national esports tournament events. Once an esports gaming center is opened, we provide operational guidance, support and use of branding elements in exchange for a monthly royalty fee calculated as 6% of gross sales. Prior to selling a franchise, among other things, the Company is required to provide a potential franchisee with a franchise disclosure document. We do not currently have an active franchise disclosure document for 2022.
 
The combination of the esports gaming centers, owned or franchised by our wholly owned subsidiaries Simplicity Esports LLC or PLAYlive, provides us with what we believe is one of the largest esports gaming center footprints in North America.

Franchise Roll Up Strategy
 
We began implementing a franchise roll-up strategy in July 2020 because of the disruption caused by COVID-19 related stay-at-home orders, and the disruption it caused to the commercial real estate market. The reduction in revenues for some franchisees because of stay-at-home orders, and government mandates to remain closed created significant accrued rent payments due to landlords. We have been able to come to terms with many franchisees to acquire the assets of their gaming centers and make them corporate owned. We have simultaneously negotiated new leases with some of the largest national mall chains, including Simon Property Group and Brookfield Asset Management, and are in the process of negotiating additional locations with other landlords. The new leases involve significant reductions in or elimination of fixed rent and the addition of percentage of revenues rent terms.
Our Stream Team
 
The Simplicity Esports LLC stream team encompasses commentators (commonly known as “casters”), influencers and personalities who connect to a dedicated fan base. Our electric group of live personalities represent our organization to the fullest with their own unique style. We are proud to support and present a diverse group of gamers as we engage fans across a multitude of esports genres. Our Twitch affiliation has enabled our stream team to reach a broad fan base. Additionally, we have created several niches within the streaming community which has enabled us to engage fans within certain titles on a 24/7 basis. Through Simplicity Esports LLC, we have begun to implement a unique approach to ensure the ultimate fan friendly esports experience. Our intention is to have gamers involved at the grassroots level and feel a sense of unity as we compete with top class talent. Our management and players are known within the esports community and we plan to use their skills to create a seamless content creation plan helping gamers feel closer to our brand than any other in the industry.
 
COVID-19
 
As a result of COVID-19, all of our corporate and franchised Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers were closed effective April 1, 2020. We commenced reopening Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers on May 1, 2020 and subsequently reopened 16 corporate and 12 franchised Simplicity Gaming Centers, the majority of which are operating at restricted capacity based on local COVID-19 regulations. Subsequent to May 31, 2022, the Company closed 12 of its 17 corporate owned esports gaming center locations. The Company continues to operate five corporate owned locations and 12 franchisee owned locations. Although our franchise agreements with franchisees of Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers require a minimum monthly royalty payment to us from the franchisees regardless of whether the franchised Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers are operating, a limited number of the franchisees of Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers have defaulted on their obligations to pay their minimum monthly royalty payment to us. This has resulted in either an increase in accounts receivables or a bad debt expense where account receivables are no longer collectible due to franchisee’s inability to pay the minimum monthly royalty payments owed by the franchisee. As of May 31, 2022, we have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $39,000 and have written off $4,000, partly in conjunction with taking back certain franchises and converting them to Company owned stores. Notwithstanding our efforts to support franchisees and still collect on receivables, it is unclear exactly how much of the increase in accounts receivables is attributable to the impact of COVID-19. We have waived the minimum monthly royalty payment obligations from July 2020 through present day and are instead billing the franchisees a true-up of 6% of gross sales without a minimum. We continue to assess possible similar accommodations to the franchisees in light of the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, the disruptions in commercial real estate caused by COVID-19 lockdowns have allowed the Company to strengthen its existing relationships with national landlords by signing new locations with percentage rent leases.

The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or the Company, may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption, reduced customer traffic and reduced operations. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but is anticipated to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
The measures taken to date adversely impacted the Company’s business during the year ended May 31, 2022 and will potentially continue to impact the Company’s business. Management observes that all business segments continue to be impacted by reduced foot traffic that began as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns and has continued as consumer habits have changed.
 
Corporate History
 
Formation
 
We were initially a blank check company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 17, 2017 under the name I-AM Capital Acquisition Company. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Although we were not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a business combination, we focused on businesses with a connection to India. On November 20, 2018, we changed our name from I-AM Capital Acquisition Company to Smaaash Entertainment, Inc. On January 2, 2019, we changed our name from Smaaash Entertainment, Inc. to Simplicity Esports and Gaming Company.
Smaaash Entertainment Private Limited
 
Business Combination
 
On November 20, 2018, the Company and Smaaash Entertainment Private Limited, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of India (“Smaaash Private”), consummated the transactions (the “Transactions” or the “Business Combination”) contemplated by the share subscription agreement (as amended, the “Subscription Agreement”), following the approval at the special meeting of the stockholders of the Company held on November 9, 2018 (the “Special Meeting”).
 
Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, the purchase price of $150,000 was paid by the Company to Smaaash Private in exchange for 294,360 newly issued equity shares of Smaaash Private at the closing of the Transactions (the “Closing”), representing less than 1% of Smaaash Private at such time.
 
At the time of the Closing, AHA Holdings Private Limited (“AHA Holdings”) and Shripal Morakhia (together with AHA Holdings, the “Smaaash Founders”) agreed to transfer all of their ownership interest in Smaaash Private (the “Additional Smaaash Shares”) to the Company in exchange for newly issued shares of our common stock (the “Transferred Company Shares”).
 
In furtherance of the foregoing, at the Closing, the Company issued an aggregate of 250,000 shares of its common stock to the Smaaash Founders as an upfront portion of the Transferred Company Shares (the “Upfront Company Shares”). In connection with the issuance of the Upfront Company Shares, the Company and the Smaaash Founders entered into an escrow agreement pursuant to which the Upfront Company Shares would be held in escrow and will be either, (i) if the Additional Smaaash Shares are not transferred in full to the Company within the designated six-month period, cancelled, or (ii) if the Additional Smaaash Shares are transferred in full to the Company within the designated six-month period, released from escrow and the number of Upfront Company Shares will be deducted from the Transferred Company Shares that will be issued to the Smaaash Founders upon the delivery of the Additional Smaaash Shares. Pursuant to the terms of the escrow agreement, the Upfront Company Shares have been cancelled because the Additional Smaaash Shares were not transferred in full to the Company in the designated six-month period.
 
In connection with the Closing, the Company changed its name from I-AM Capital Acquisition Company to Smaaash Entertainment Inc. changed its stock symbols for its common stock, public rights and public warrants to “IAM,” “IAMXR,” and “IAMXW,” respectively, and entered into a master franchise agreement (“Master Franchise Agreement”) and a master license and distribution agreement (“Master Distribution Agreement”) with Smaaash Private. After the Closing, the Company’s primary assets consisted of shares in Smaaash Private and the rights granted under the Master Franchise Agreement and the Master Distribution Agreement.
 
Business of Smaaash Private
 
At the time of closing of the Smaaash transaction, Smaaash Private operated 40 games and entertainment centers (“Smaaash Centers”), including 39 Smaaash Centers in India and one international Smaaash Center in the U.S., in addition to carrying out product sales of its games and equipment that Smaaash has developed in-house, supported by its sponsorship and other revenues.
 
Smaaash Private’s core concept was to offer an interactive, immersive and fun experience to customers at its Smaaash Centers, blending Augmented Reality (“AR”) and Virtual Reality (“VR”) and other games, indoor entertainment, and attractive food and beverage options, customized to the tastes and preferences of a diverse set of customers across age groups, genders and backgrounds, including corporate customers, families, friends and children. Smaaash Private’s game concepts are supported by its in-house technology, value engineering and systems integration capabilities.

Master Franchise Agreement
 
Under the Master Franchise Agreement, Smaaash Private granted to the Company an exclusive right to establish and operate Smaaash Centers (as defined under the Master Franchise Agreement) and to sublicense the right to establish and operate Smaaash Centers to third party franchisees, and a license to use the products and other services developed by Smaaash Private with respect to the Smaaash Centers, in the United States (“Territory”). Further, Smaaash Private has granted to the Company the limited license to use the Trademarks of Smaaash Private (as set out in the Master Franchise Agreement) for the purposes of establishing and operating the Smaaash Centers in the Territory. The Master Franchise Agreement was executed on an arms’ length basis between Smaaash Private and the Company.
Master License and Distribution Agreement
 
Under the Master Distribution Agreement, Smaaash Private granted to the Company an exclusive right to purchase from Smaaash Private specialized video game equipment and products related to sports and recreational activities (“Products”) in the territory under the brand name of Smaaash Private and sell them with a 15% markup to the customers which will be the sub-franchisees of the Company who will operate the Smaaash Centers, as specified in the Master Franchise Agreement.
Shift of Business Focus to Esports Gaming
 
Following the January 2019 acquisition of Simplicity Esports LLC described below, we determined to shift our primary business focus to esports gaming. Accordingly, we did not generate any revenues from Smaaash in 2019. The Master Franchise Agreement, as amended, and the Master Distribution Agreement continue in full force and effect, however, and we may now or in the future pursue Smaaash Private business opportunities.
 
Polar and K2
 
On November 2, 2018, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with each of Polar Asset Management Partners Inc. (“Polar”) and K2 Principal Fund L.P. (“K2”), pursuant to which Polar and K2 agreed to sell up to 61,250 and 27,500 shares, respectively, of the Company’s common stock to the Company 30 days after the consummation of the transactions at a price of $89.84 contemplated by the share subscription agreement with Smaaash Private.
 
On December 20, 2018, the Company, Polar, K2 and the escrow agent, entered into an Amendment (the “Amendment”), pursuant to which, among other things, the stock purchase agreements with Polar and K2 were amended to (x) reduce the purchase price per share payable by the Company at the closing of the stock sales from $89.84 per share to (1) first $48.00 per share up to 20% of the original number of Shares (as defined in the respective Purchase Agreement), (2) then $40.00 per remaining share up to 20% of the original number of Shares, (3) then $32.00 per remaining share up to 20% of the original number of Shares, (4) then $24.00 per remaining Share up to 20% of the original number of Shares, and (5) then $16.00 per remaining Share up to 20% of the original number of Shares, (y) to extend the outside date of the closing of the stock sales until January 18, 2019, and (z) to authorize the issuance of $3,542,700 and $1,590,600 from the escrow account to Polar and K2, respectively, as partial payment for the Shares prior to the final closing of the stock sales.

The Amendment also included provisions regarding the reduction of the exercise price and amendment of redemption provisions of the Company’s public warrants and private placement warrants. On August 18, 2019, the Company held a special meeting of its public warrant holders to approve the foregoing. However, these proposals were not approved by the requisite votes.
 
Registration Rights
 
Pursuant to a registration rights agreement the Company entered into with its initial stockholders and initial purchasers of the Private Units (and constituent securities) at the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company is required to register certain securities for sale under the Securities Act. These holders are entitled under the registration rights agreement to make up to three demands that the Company register certain of its securities held by them for sale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and to have the securities covered thereby registered for resale pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. In addition, these holders have the right to include their securities in other registration statements filed by the Company. The Company will bear the costs and expenses of filing any such registration statements.
Unit Purchase Option
 
The Company sold to the underwriters (and/or their designees), for $100, an option to purchase up to a total of 250,000 Units (which increased to 260,000 Units upon the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option), exercisable at $11.50 per Unit (or an aggregate exercise price of $2,990,000) upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The UPO may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, at any time during the period commencing on the later of the first anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement relating to the Initial Public Offering and the closing of the Company’s initial Business Combination and terminating on the fifth anniversary of such effectiveness date (i.e. November 20, 2023). The Units issuable upon exercise of this UPO are identical to those offered in the Initial Public Offering, except that the exercise price of the warrants underlying the Units sold to the underwriters is $13.00 per share.
 
Acquisition of Simplicity Esports, LLC
 
In connection with the Company’s January 2019 acquisition of Simplicity Esports, LLC, the sellers received an aggregate of 37,500 shares of common stock at the closing on January 4, 2019, an additional aggregate of 87,500 shares of common stock on January 7, 2019 and the remaining 250,000 shares in March 2019.
 
In connection with the acquisition of Simplicity Esports, LLC, on January 2, 2019, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate Amendment”) with the Delaware Secretary of State to change the Company’s name from “Smaaash Entertainment, Inc.” to “Simplicity Esports and Gaming Company.” In addition, the Company changed the ticker symbols of its common stock and public warrants to “WINR” and “WINRW,” respectively, and commenced trading of its common stock and public warrants under such new ticker symbols on the OTCQB on January 10, 2019.
 
During the year ended May 31, 2021, the Company applied for and received two loans payable under the Payroll Protection Plan (“PPP”). The first loan was for $83,000 and the second loan was for $41,000. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, the Company applied for and was granted loan forgiveness for the first of the PPP loans. As of May 31, 2022, the Company has one outstanding PPP loan in the amount of $41,000. The Company has applied for permanent relief for the second loan payable under the PPP federal guidelines.
