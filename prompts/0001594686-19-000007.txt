Item 1.    Business
 Unless the context otherwise requires, references to "WPG," "the Company," "we," "us" or "our" refer to WPG Inc., WPG L.P. and entities in which WPG Inc. or WPG L.P. (or any affiliate) has a material ownership or financial interest, on a consolidated basis.
General
Washington Prime GroupÂ®Inc. ("WPG Inc.") is an Indiana corporation that operates as a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). WPG Inc. will generally qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes as long as it continues to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, exclusive of net capital gains, and satisfy certain other requirements. WPG Inc. will generally be allowed a deduction against its U.S. federal income tax liability for dividends paid by it to REIT shareholders, thereby reducing or eliminating any corporate level taxation to WPG Inc. Washington Prime Group, L.P. ("WPG L.P.") is WPG Inc.'s majority-owned limited partnership subsidiary that owns, develops, and manages, through its affiliates, all of WPG Inc.'s real estate properties and other assets. WPG Inc. is the sole general partner of WPG L.P. On May 28, 2014, WPG separated from Simon Property Group Inc. ("SPG") through the distribution of 100% of the outstanding units of WPG L.P. to the owners of Simon Property Group L.P. and 100% of the outstanding shares of WPG to the SPG common shareholders in a tax-free distribution. Prior to the separation, WPG Inc. and WPG L.P. were wholly owned subsidiaries of SPG and its subsidiaries ("SPG Businesses"). At the time of the separation, our assets consisted of interests in 98 shopping centers (the "WPG Legacy Properties"). On January 15, 2015, the Company acquired Glimcher Realty Trust ("GRT"), in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $4.2 billion, including the assumption of debt (the "Merger"). In the Merger, we acquired material interests in 23 shopping centers and assumed mortgages on 14 properties with a fair value of approximately $1.4 billion. Prior to our separation from SPG, WPG Inc. entered into agreements with SPG under which SPG provided various services to WPG Inc. relating primarily to the legacy SPG Businesses and WPG Legacy Properties, including accounting, asset management, development, human resources, information technology, leasing, legal, marketing, public reporting and tax. The charges for the services were based on an hourly or per transaction fee arrangement and pass-through of out-of-pocket costs. Except for certain indemnification obligations and other terms and conditions, these underlying agreements expired effective May 31, 2016.
We own, develop and manage enclosed retail properties and open air properties. As of December 31, 2018, our assets consisted of material interests in 108 shopping centers in the United States, comprised of approximately 58 million square feet of managed gross leasable area ("GLA").
Transactions
For a description of our operational strategies and developments in our business during 2018 see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," of this Form 10-K.
Segments
Our primary business is the ownership, development and management of retail real estate within the United States. We have aggregated our operations, including enclosed retail properties and open air properties, into one reportable segment because they have similar economic characteristics and we provide similar products and services to similar types of tenants and, in many cases, the same tenants. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Signet Jewelers, Ltd. (based on common parent ownership of tenants including, but not limited to, Body by Pagoda, Jared's, Kay Jewelers, Piercing Pagoda, Rogers Jewelers, and Zales Jewelers) accounted for approximately 2.9% of base minimum rents. Further, Signet Jewelers, Ltd., L Brands, Inc. (based on common parent ownership of tenants including Bath & Body Works, La Senza, Pink, Victoria's Secret, and White Barn Candle), Dick's Sporting Goods (based on common parent ownership including Dick's Sporting Goods, Field & Stream, and Golf Galaxy) and Footlocker, Inc. (based on common parent ownership including Champs Sports, Foot Action USA, Footlocker, Kids Footlocker, Lady Footlocker, and World Footlocker), in aggregate, comprised approximately 9.4% of base minimum rents. See Item 2. "Properties" for further information on tenant mix.
Other Policies
The following is a discussion of our investment policies, financing policies, conflicts of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities. One or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote.

Investment Policies
We are in the business of owning, managing and operating enclosed retail properties and open air properties across the United States and while we emphasize these real estate investments, we may also invest in equity or debt securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers. However, any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for REIT qualification of WPG Inc. under federal tax laws as well as our own internal policies concerning conflicts of interest and related party transactions. These REIT limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real estate assets to be less than 75% of our total assets. We must also derive at least 75% of our gross income directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including "rents from real property," dividends from other REITs and, in certain circumstances, interest from certain types of temporary investments. In addition, we must also derive at least 95% of our gross income from such real property investments, and from dividends, interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing.
Subject to REIT limitations, we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate. Such an investment would normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties. We may, in the future, acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs, management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies.
Financing Policies
Because WPG Inc.'s REIT qualification requires it to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income, exclusive of net capital gains, we regularly access the capital markets to raise the funds necessary to finance operations, acquisitions, strategic investments, development and redevelopment opportunities, and to refinance maturing debt. We must comply with customary covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total assets or market value, as defined in such agreements. For example, WPG L.P.'s current line of credit and term loans contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of WPG L.P. to 60% of total assets, as defined under the related agreements, and secured debt to 40% of total assets, with slight easing of restrictions during the four trailing quarters following a portfolio acquisition. In addition, these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios. Furthermore, the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for our equity securities and debt securities of WPG L.P. We strive to maintain investment grade ratings at all times, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in the future (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" within Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Form 10-K for a discussion of events that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2018).
If WPG Inc.'s Board of Directors determines to seek additional capital, we may raise such capital by offering equity or debt securities, creating joint ventures with existing ownership interests in properties, entering into joint venture arrangements for new development projects, or a combination of these methods. If the Board of Directors determines to raise equity capital, it may, without shareholder approval, issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock. The Board of Directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate. Such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of common stock. Such securities also may include additional classes of preferred stock, which may be convertible into common stock. Existing shareholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares in any subsequent offering of WPG Inc.'s securities. Any such offering could dilute a shareholder's investment in WPG Inc.
We expect most future borrowings would be made through WPG L.P. or its subsidiaries. Borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings, publicly and privately placed debt instruments, or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties. Any such indebtedness may be secured or unsecured. Any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or be cross-collateralized with other debt, or may be fully or partially guaranteed by WPG L.P. Although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends, we currently have no expectation that we will regularly do so. See "Financing and Debt" within Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," of this Form 10-K for a discussion of our debt arrangements as of December 31, 2018.
We could potentially issue additional debt securities through WPG L.P., and we may issue such debt securities which may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock. We also may sell or securitize our lease receivables.
We may also finance acquisitions through the issuance of common shares or preferred shares, the issuance of additional units of partnership interest in WPG L.P., the issuance of preferred units of WPG L.P., the issuance of other securities including unsecured notes and mortgage debt, draws on our credit facilities or sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties, including through the formation of joint venture agreements or other arrangements.

WPG L.P. may also issue units to transferors of properties or other partnership interests which may permit the transferor to defer gain recognition for tax purposes.
We do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property. Mortgage financing instruments, however, usually limit additional indebtedness on such properties. Additionally, unsecured credit facilities, unsecured note indentures and other contracts may limit our ability to borrow and contain limits on the amount of secured indebtedness we may incur.
Typically, we will invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining secured permanent financing at attractive terms. Permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a single property, or on a group of properties, and will generally require us to provide a mortgage lien on the property or properties in favor of an institutional third party, as a joint venture with a third party, or as a securitized financing. For securitized financings, we may create special purpose entities to own the properties. These special purpose entities, which are common in the real estate industry, are structured with the intention of not being consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a parent company. We will decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives. For accounting purposes, we will include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness.
Conflicts of Interest Policies
We maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest. We have adopted governance principles governing our affairs and those of the Board of Directors.
Under WPG Inc.âs Governance Principles, directors must disclose to the rest of the Board of Directors any potential conflict of interest they may have with respect to any matter under discussion and, if appropriate, recuse themselves from Board of Director discussions of, and/or refrain from voting on, such matter. Directors shall not have a duty to communicate or present any corporate opportunity to WPG Inc. and WPG Inc. renounces any interest or expectancy in such opportunity and waives any claim against a director arising from the fact that he or she does not present the opportunity to WPG Inc. or pursues or facilitates the pursuit of the opportunity by others; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply in a case in which a director is presented with a corporate opportunity in writing expressly in his or her capacity as a director or officer of WPG Inc. 
In addition, we have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all of our officers, directors, and employees. At least a majority of the members of WPG Inc.'s Board of Directors, Governance and Nominating Committee, Audit Committee and Compensation Committee must qualify as independent under the listing standards for New York Stock Exchange listed companies. Any transaction between us and any officer, WPG Inc. director or any family member of any of the foregoing persons, or 5% shareholder of WPG Inc. must be approved pursuant to our related party transaction policy.
Policies With Respect To Certain Other Activities
We intend to make investments which are consistent with WPG Inc.'s qualification as a REIT, unless the Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in WPG Inc.'s best interests to so qualify as a REIT. The Board of Directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the REIT requirements. We have authority to offer shares of our capital stock or other securities in exchange for property. We also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities. We may issue shares of our common stock, or cash at our option, to holders of units in future periods upon exercise of such holders' rights under the Operating Partnership agreement. Our policy prohibits us from making any loans to our directors or executive officers for any purpose. We may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate. Additionally, we may make or buy interests in loans for real estate properties owned by others.
Competition
Our direct competitors include other publicly-traded retail development and operating companies, retail real estate companies, commercial property developers and other owners of retail real estate that engage in similar businesses. Within our property portfolio, we compete for retail tenants and the nature and extent of the competition we face varies from property to property. With respect to specific alternative retail property types, we have faced increased competition over the last several years from both lifestyle centers and power centers, in addition to other open air properties and enclosed retail properties.

We believe the principal factors that retailers consider in making their leasing decisions include, but are not limited to, the following:

â¢ | Consumer demographics;


â¢ | Quality, design and location of properties;


â¢ | Total number and geographic distribution of properties;


â¢ | Diversity of retailers and anchor tenants;


â¢ | Management and operational expertise; and


â¢ | Rental rates.

In addition, because our revenue potential is linked to the success of our retailers, we indirectly share exposure to the same competitive factors and market forces that our retail tenants experience in their respective markets when trying to attract individual shoppers. These dynamics include general competition from other retail properties, including outlet properties and other discount shopping properties, as well as competition with discount shopping clubs, catalog companies, direct mail, home shopping networks, and telemarketing. The changes in consumer shopping behavior to increase purchases on-line from their computers and mobile devices provide retailers with distribution options other than brick and mortar retail stores and has resulted in competitive alternatives that could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease, develop and redevelop traditional commercial retail space and on the level of rents we can obtain. 
Seasonality
The shopping center business is, to some extent, seasonal in nature with tenants typically achieving the highest levels of sales during our fiscal fourth quarter due to the holiday season, which generally results in higher percentage rent income in the fourth quarter. Additionally, enclosed shopping centers achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer) rents during the holiday season. Thus, occupancy levels and revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year. Results of operations realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the results likely to be experienced over the course of our fiscal year.
Environmental Matters
See Item 1A. "Risk Factors" for information concerning the potential effects of environmental regulations on our operations.
Intellectual Property
WPG L.P., by and through its affiliates, holds service marks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, including the terms Washington Prime GroupÂ® (expiration date January 2028), The Outlet CollectionÂ®(expiration date October 2023), Shelbyâs Sugar ShopÂ® (expiration date September 2028), and TANGIBLEÂ®(expiration date September 2028) as well as the names of certain of our properties such as Scottsdale QuarterÂ® (expiration date November 2019) and Polaris Fashion PlaceÂ® (expiration date July 2022), and other marketing terms, phrases, and materials it uses to promote its business, services, and properties.
Sustainability
ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance)
We know that ESG issues, otherwise known as corporate sustainability, are important to our stakeholders, and they are important to the Company. We believe in a strong commitment to the community and embrace opportunities to improve the lives of our guests, employees and the environment.
The Board of Directorsâ Sustainability Committee, as well as our internal, interdisciplinary ESG Steering Committee, work together with senior leadership to further establish sustainability as a key business driver as it relates to how we redevelop and operate our retail properties, conduct business with our guests, engage with our communities and create a productive and positive work environment for our employees. The Company will continue to work diligently to find ways to manage our properties' carbon footprint and identify environmentally-friendly alternatives that reduce waste, maximize energy efficiency and improve recycling efforts.
Some examples of the Companyâs focus on environmental sustainability investments in its properties include energy efficient Light Emitting Diode ("LED") lighting projects, charging stations for electric cars, solar energy panels, and many more innovations. As it relates to new projects, we are focused on the area of energy reduction and leveraging sustainability to achieve cost efficiencies in our operations. We are working with local and state municipalities to expand the Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) model promulgated by the U.S. Department of Energy to help finance energy efficiency projects at its retail properties. The Company continues to install efficient LED lighting, including installations at nearly 40 of our retail properties in the past two years, which has led to a 9 percent reduction in the Company's annual electric consumption.

In addition, the Company is working with a third party to implement operational and technology improvements at the property level. This initiative includes technical communications, WiFi design and implementation, as well as analytics and reporting in order to make informed future energy management decisions. We continue to explore ways to innovate even more so in the future.
We believe a commitment to incorporating sustainable practices into many of the areas of our business will add long term value to our portfolio of retail town centers.
Employees
