Item 1. Business.
Our Company
Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated in Delaware on October 10, 2007. We commenced commercial operations on November 19, 2007 following the acquisition of the metals business from Olin Corporation. The majority of our operations are managed through three reportable operating segments: Olin Brass, Chase Brass and A.J. Oster.
We are a leading value-added converter, fabricator, processor and distributor of specialized non-ferrous products, including a wide range of sheet, strip, foil, rod, tube and fabricated metal component products. While we primarily process copper and copper alloys, we also reroll and form certain other metals such as stainless steel, carbon steel and aluminum. Using processed scrap, virgin metals and other refined metals, we engage in metal melting and casting, rolling, drawing, extruding, welding and stamping to fabricate finished and semi-finished alloy products. Key attributes of copper and copper alloys are conductivity, corrosion resistance, strength, malleability, cosmetic appearance and bactericidal properties. 
Unlike traditional metals companies, particularly those that engage in mining, smelting and refining activities, we are purely a metal converter, fabricator, processor and distributor, and we do not attempt to generate profits from fluctuations in publicly traded commodity metal prices. Our financial performance is primarily driven by metal conversion economics, not by the underlying movements in the commodity price of copper and the other metals we use. Through our “balanced book” approach (as further described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Business Principles Affecting Our Results of Operations —Balanced Book”), we strive to match the timing, quantity and price of our metal sales with the timing, quantity and price of our replacement metal purchases. We do this, for the most part, by basing both sales and purchase transaction on the price of publicly traded commodity prices and having both transactions occur on the same date. This practice, along with our toll processing operations and last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) inventory accounting methodology, substantially reduces the financial impact of metal price movements on our earnings and operating margins.
Our products are used in a variety of applications across diversified markets, including the building and housing, munitions, automotive, transportation, coinage, electronics / electrical components, industrial machinery and equipment, signage, and general consumer markets. We access these markets through direct mill sales, our captive distribution network and third-party distributors. Through May 16, 2019, we hold the exclusive production and distribution rights in North America for a lead-free brass rod product, which we sell under the Green Dot® and Eco Brass® brand names. We anticipate the expiration of this exclusive license may have a negative effect on our financial performance. We believe we are the only domestic copper and brass sheet manufacturer with captive distribution and service center operations, a competitive advantage that allows us to service and access customers with a wide variety of volume and service needs.
We service nearly 4,200 customers in 28 countries across four continents. We employ approximately 1,900 people and operate 16 manufacturing facilities and distribution centers across the United States (“U.S.”), Puerto Rico and Mexico.
We own 80% of a value-added service center in Guangzhou, China (“Olin Luotong Metals” or “OLM”); the other 20% is owned by Chinalco Luoyang Copper Co. Ltd. (“Chinalco”). Through Olin Luotong Metals, together with our sales offices in China and Singapore, we supply our products in China and throughout Southeast Asia.

Segments Overview
We have three reportable operating segments: Olin Brass, Chase Brass and A.J. Oster. 

Activities | ● Leading manufacturer, fabricator and converter | ● Leading manufacturer and supplier | ● Leading processor and distributor 
Products | ● Specialized copper and brass sheet, strip, foil, tube, and fabricated products | ● Brass rod, including environmentally friendly alloys | ● Primarily copper, brass, and aluminum sheet, strip and coated products
Key Markets | ● Building and Housing | ● Building and Housing | ● Building and Housing 
 | ● Automotive | ● Transportation | ● Automotive 
 | ● Electronics / Electrical Components | ● Electronics / Electrical Components | ● Electronics / Electrical Components 
 | ● Munitions | ● Industrial Machinery and Equipment | 
 | ● Coinage | | 

All of our segments sell to the building and housing market. While demand within this market is affected by new residential housing, existing home sales and commercial construction, all of which are seasonal and dependent on overall economic conditions, the correlation between housing statistics and our sales is not entirely direct. Our key products are typically installed near the completion of construction, meaning there is an inherent lag time compared to housing starts, and sales of our building and housing products can be affected by factors such as housing mix (unit size, unit price point and the mix of multi-family versus single-family construction). Sales of our products can also be impacted by changes in the composition of materials and fixtures used in construction as well as competition from imported brass rod and importation of finished product made from brass rod.
The red metals industry is different from other metals industries in several ways, two of which are price and variety. Copper trades on public commodity exchanges at prices which are generally more expensive than steel or aluminum. In 2018 for example, average COMEX copper was $2.93 per pound compared to $0.96 per pound for aluminum or $0.44 per pound for steel. Thus, the investment our customers have to make in inventory to hold the same number of pounds in copper or a copper alloy is significantly greater. We believe our short lead times and on-time delivery performance within our businesses is better than most of our competitors, providing a competitive advantage by allowing our customers to hold less inventory. Also, our copper and copper alloy finished products are less standardized than finished products in the aluminum or steel industries. Thus, our ability to manufacture custom alloys in a wide variety of gauges and finishes, especially within our Olin Brass business, is a competitive advantage to meeting customers’ overall needs.
Further information about our business segments and the geographic areas of our operations can be found in “Note 5, Segment Information.”
Olin Brass
In addition to manufacturing, fabricating and converting specialized copper and brass sheet, strip, foil, tube and fabricated products, Olin Brass also rerolls and forms other alloys such as stainless steel, carbon steel and aluminum. Sheet and strip is generally manufactured from copper and copper-alloy scrap.
Olin Brass manufactures its wide variety of products through four sites in North America. It is not uncommon for Olin Brass to produce 50 different alloys, approximately 30% of which could be high performance alloys (“HPAs”).

Olin Brass’s integrated brass mill in East Alton, Illinois is its main operating facility, which melts metal and produces strip products that are either sold directly to external customers, sold to its affiliate, A.J. Oster, or shipped to Olin Brass’s downstream operations for further value-added processing. Olin Brass’s downstream operations include:

• | a stamping operation located in East Alton;


• | a rolling mill in Waterbury, Connecticut with rolling, annealing, leveling, plating and slitting capabilities for various products (“Somers Thin Strip”), including stainless steel thin strip;


• | a manufacturing facility in Bryan, Ohio specializing in products sold in the automotive and electronics / electrical components markets; and


• | a manufacturing facility in Cuba, Missouri that produces high frequency welded copper-alloy tube for heat transfer, utility, decorative, automotive and plumbing applications.

Olin Brass’s products are sold to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), other external customers, distributors / rerollers or to its affiliate, A.J. Oster. In 2018, approximately 18% of Olin Brass’s products were shipped to distribution customers, which includes its affiliate A.J. Oster. In 2018, approximately 15% of Olin Brass’s shipments were to A.J. Oster.
The following chart shows the primary markets for Olin Brass’s products and the percentage of shipments.
(1) Shipments to A.J. Oster are reflected in the supply chain market and are eliminated in consolidation.
Munitions Market
Olin Brass manufactures products utilized in both the military and commercial munitions markets, such as strip and cups, that are used to produce shot shells, bullet jackets, centerfire, rimfire and small caliber military munitions.
Customers in this market include major munitions producers in the U.S., including those producing small caliber ammunition for the U.S. military. Demand within this market is affected by the U.S. government’s security policies and troop size, as well as consumer demand for firearms and munitions. While munitions demand is predominantly domestic, occasional opportunities arise to supply U.S. alliance partners with these products.
4

Coinage Market
Olin Brass supplies strip for use in the production of coins (no pennies) primarily for the United States Mint, for which we are a key supplier contracted into 2022. We have been a highly regarded supplier to the United States Mint for over 40 years, as our long-term contracts have historically been renewed at termination.
The demand within this market is affected by the level of activities in retail transactions, the use of vending machines, trends affecting forms of payment, and management of inventory levels within the U.S. Mint and Federal Reserve.
Automotive Market
Olin Brass manufactures both strip and fabricated products used as electronic and electrical connectors for use in automobiles. These products are made with HPAs, suitable for applications requiring high reliability, high temperature and low insertion force. For example, these electrical connectors, along with lead frames manufactured by us, are used in junction boxes, wiring harnesses, ignition and battery systems, lighting and media systems within vehicles.
Customers in this market include primary automotive connector suppliers in the U.S. Historically the business in this market remained largely regional in the U.S. Demand within this market is affected by the level of consumer spending on automobiles, which is significantly dependent on overall economic conditions and the amount of electrical components contained within automobiles. In addition, demand is affected by the increasing inclusion of electrical systems (televisions, cameras, sensors, etc.) within vehicles and trends towards electric powered vehicles.
Building and Housing Market
Olin Brass manufactures a variety of strip, welded tube and stamped parts used in commercial and residential buildings, such as faucets, locksets, decorative door hardware and hinges, which require workability, corrosion resistance and attractive appearance. Olin Brass also manufactures strip for products requiring high electrical conductivity, such as plug outlets, switches, lamp shells, other wiring devices, industrial controls, circuit breakers and switchgears. These products are generally manufactured with copper and copper-alloy sheet and strip, both HPAs and standard alloys, as well as copper-alloy welded tube.
Customers in this market are OEMs producing building and housing products. Olin Brass also supplies building and housing products in China through Olin Luotong Metals.
Electronics / Electrical Components Market
Olin Brass manufactures strip used in integrated circuit sockets for circuit boards, electrical connectors for laptop computers and similar devices, consumer electronics and appliances, and foils for flexible circuit applications. The strip manufactured in this market is concentrated in HPAs and is sold directly to end-use customers and distributors.
Customers in this market are primarily electronics manufacturers that operate globally. A portion of these customers is serviced through A.J. Oster, and the remainder is supplied directly by Olin Brass, with its Somers Thin Strip facility providing the foil products on a global scale.
Demand within this market is affected by consumer spending on electronics, which may fluctuate significantly as a result of economic conditions.
International
The Olin Brass segment exported 17.8 million pounds into markets that primarily serve the building and housing, automotive and electronics / electrical components markets. 
Asia
Included within our Olin Brass business, our Asian operations provide service, distribution and sales activities to meet the growing demand for copper alloys in that region. These activities are conducted through two of our subsidiaries, Olin Luotong Metals (“OLM”) in China and GBC Metals Asia Pacific PTE (“GMAP”) in Singapore. These operations source materials from Olin Brass, as well as other copper and brass mills, such as Chinalco and DOWA Metaltech Co. LTD (“Dowa Metaltech”). In 2018, these Asian operations generated $40.7 million of net sales, or 6% of the Olin Brass segment’s net sales. On a pounds basis, our Asian operations sold 8.9 million pounds (4% of the Olin Brass segment’s sales) of product into Asia through OLM and GMAP, primarily into key electronics markets. 
5

Others
The remainder of Olin Brass’s international sales are primarily to Mexico, Canada and European countries and were 8.9 million pounds (4% of the Olin Brass segment’s sales) in 2018.
Chase Brass
Chase Brass primarily manufactures solid brass rod, in round, hexagonal and other shapes, ranging from 1/4 inch to 4 1/2 inches in diameter. Brass rod is generally manufactured from copper or copper-alloy scrap and all of Chase Brass’s rod is manufactured at its Montpelier, Ohio facility. Chase Brass customers machine, bore out, or otherwise process the rod for various applications used in a variety of markets. Brass rod is primarily used for forged and machined products, such as valves and fittings. Key attributes of brass rod include its machinability, corrosion resistance and moderate strength. 
Demand for Chase’s brass rod has been impacted by increasing imports of forged and machined product that competes directly with the products our customers manufacture out of brass rod purchased from us. It is also impacted by our customers relocating production facilities to overseas, lower cost production locations. In response, Chase Brass is beginning to semi-fabricate parts from its brass rod to make its customers more cost competitive. In some instances, Chase Brass may manufacture and sell fully fabricated parts to customers. To date, sales of semi-finished and fully fabricated parts have not been significant.
Chase Brass provides its customers with high quality rod product under short lead times with high on-time delivery performance. In addition, Chase Brass partners with customers to buy the scrap customers generate from manufacturing rod purchased from Chase Brass. These customer scrap buy-backs often occur at prices greater than what customers could get from the general scrap market and helps compete against imported rod. Chase Brass has been able to capitalize on opportunities arising from regulation limiting lead content in potable water plumbing fixtures. Our green product portfolio, including Eco Brass® product which we manufacture under an exclusive license through May 16, 2019, grew significantly from 2010 to 2016 as customers switched from leaded to non or low-leaded products in certain applications. We anticipate the expiration of this exclusive license may have a negative effect on our financial performance.
6

The following chart shows the primary markets for Chase Brass’s products and our estimates of the percentage of shipments for each. We believe that substantially all of the electronics / electrical components shipments below are associated with the building and housing and transportation markets.

Building and Housing Market
Chase Brass manufactures brass rod for use in faucets, valves and fittings used in residential and commercial construction.
Chase Brass produces a number of low-lead and lead-free products, or “green portfolio” products, which comply with certain state and federal laws that became effective in January 2014. This legislation defines the allowed level of lead content in products used in plumbing and drinking water applications. Chase Brass’s Green Dot® rod, Eco Brass® rod and Eco Brass® ingot products are part of the green portfolio, and Chase Brass is the exclusive licensee of the intellectual property rights for their production, sale and distribution in North America through May 16, 2019. Chase Brass also manufactures other non-patented green portfolio products. Green portfolio products accounted for approximately 20% of pounds shipped by Chase Brass in 2018. We anticipate the expiration of this exclusive license may have a negative effect on our financial performance.
Industrial Machinery and Equipment Market
Chase Brass manufactures brass rod which is further machined into industrial valves and fittings. Demand within this market is affected by capital spending levels, U.S. gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth and industrial production growth in the U.S.
Customers in this market include various major diversified manufacturers and a variety of screw machine companies supporting OEMs.
Transportation Market
Chase Brass manufactures brass rod for applications in heavy trucks and automobiles. Specific applications include heavy truck braking systems, tire valves, temperature sensors and various truck and automotive fittings. Demand within this market is affected by levels of transportation activity, levels of maintenance capital spending by transportation companies and the level of commercial truck fleet replacement activity, all of which are affected significantly by overall economic conditions. Customers in this market include major OEMs in the transport industry and customers who support domestic automotive production.
7

Electronics / Electrical Components Market
Chase Brass manufactures brass rod used for telecommunication applications, including products such as coaxial connectors and traps and filters for cable television, as well as larger connectors supporting the cell tower industry. Demand within this market is affected by consumer spending, new home construction, and technologies affecting communication devices and methods, such as wi-fi. Customers within this market include major manufacturers of specialty products for use in home and commercial construction, both of which are very dependent on overall economic conditions. We believe a significant portion of shipments in this market segment are directly associated with the building and housing market and transportation markets.
International
Chase Brass primarily supplies products within North America, and generated $41.2 million in net sales (7% of the Chase Brass segment’s net sales) to Canada and Mexico in 2018. Sales to Canada and Mexico were 23.5 million pounds (11% of the Chase Brass segment’s sales) in 2018.
A.J. Oster
A.J. Oster has historically been a processor and distributor of primarily copper and copper-alloy sheet, strip, and foil. However, with the acquisition of the Alumet business on November 1, 2017, A.J. Oster significantly expanded its product portfolio into aluminum sheet and coated aluminum products. The acquisition also deepened its presence in the signage (aluminum) and roofing (copper and copper-alloy) markets within the building and housing industry. A.J. Oster historically operated six strategically located service centers in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and Mexico and, with the Alumet acquisition, added five more service centers, including those in the South and Southeast where A.J. Oster had no presence.
Key A.J. Oster competitive advantages are: short lead-times with high reliability, high level of service, small-quantity deliveries, high quality metal, and a broad alloy breadth offering, including HPAs from Olin Brass. These capabilities, combined with A.J. Oster’s operations of precision slitting, hot tinning, traverse winding, cutting, coating, and special packaging, provide value to a broad customer base.
In 2018, Olin Brass provided A.J. Oster with 51% of its copper-based products. Aurubis AG (“Aurubis”) is A.J. Oster’s second largest supplier after Olin Brass, supplying approximately 25% of A.J. Oster’s copper-based products in 2018. Many of the coils purchased from Olin Brass and Aurubis are full-width and require slitting.
8

The following chart shows the primary markets for A.J. Oster’s products and the percentage of shipments for each.


Building and Housing Market
A.J. Oster distributes copper-alloy strip and aluminum foil used by our customers to manufacture products for commercial and residential applications. The primary applications are electrical, hardware, signage, and roofing.
Electrical products are primarily for wiring devices. Other electrical applications include switchgears, switches, controls and circuit breakers. Several of our customers for these products are in Puerto Rico or Mexico. A.J. Oster’s capabilities are well-suited for these geographic locations and the stringent service requirements of the electrical market because A.J. Oster is able to provide customers with high-quality metals, in less-than-truckload quantities, and can deliver products shortly after receiving orders.
Hardware products include products such as faucets, window trim, locksets, hinges and kick plates.
A.J. Oster provides aluminum coated products into the signage industry for a wide variety of government and commercial purposes.
With the Alumet acquisition, A.J. Oster now provides copper and copper-alloy sheet and strip product into the architectural roofing industry for both commercial and residential buildings.
Automotive Market
A.J. Oster distributes copper-alloy strip and aluminum foil used in automobiles. Primary customer products are electrical connectors, automotive trim and heat exchangers.
A.J. Oster’s subsidiary in Queretaro, Mexico is strategically and geographically well-positioned to take advantage of the growing number of second-tier automobile component suppliers in Mexico.
Demand within this market is affected by the overall trends affecting auto sales, such as consumer spending and overall economic conditions, the increasing electrification of vehicles with systems such as cameras, communication devices, and computer technologies, and the trend towards electric powered vehicles.
9

Electronics / Electrical Components Market
A.J. Oster distributes copper-alloy strip used for electrical connectors in computers, consumer electronics and automobiles. 
The demand within this market is affected by consumer spending and trends in electronics, which may fluctuate significantly as a result of economic conditions.
International
A.J. Oster operates a service center in central Mexico. The facility is located in Queretaro in the center of Mexico’s industrial triangle marked by Mexico City, Monterey and Guadalajara and is easily accessible by highway connections to the U.S.
Automotive sub-suppliers that consume copper-alloy strip are now locating facilities in central Mexico in order to support primary automotive manufacturing.
Net sales from A.J. Oster Mexico were $44.1 million during 2018 (9% of A.J. Oster segment’s net sales). Pounds shipped from A.J. Oster Mexico were 10.7 million and comprised 8% of the A.J. Oster segment’s sales.
Raw Materials and Supply
We manufacture our products from scrap metal (both internally generated and externally sourced) or virgin raw materials. During 2018, 90% of our metal came from scrap metal, and the remainder came from virgin raw materials. 
We purchase virgin raw materials, including copper cathode, at a premium on the London Metal Exchange (“LME”) or Commodities Exchange (“COMEX”) or directly from key dealers that support producers around the world. Although virgin raw materials are more expensive compared to scrap, we use them to ensure quality production of certain alloys, especially HPAs.
Customers
Our customer base is broadly diversified across North America geographies and our end markets, as previously discussed. In 2018, we sold approximately 12,000 different stock keeping units (“SKUs”) to nearly 4,200 customers.
Also in 2018, net sales from our foreign entities were $84.8 million, or 5% of our net sales. We have long-term relationships with our customers, many of which are secured through short-term contracts. Our relationships with many of our significant customers have lasted more than 30 years.
All three of our operating segments had customers to whom sales activity constituted more than 10% of net sales during 2018. The largest customer within each of Olin Brass, Chase Brass and A.J. Oster comprised 24%, 20%, and 13% of net sales, respectively. Olin Brass’ second largest customer comprised 17% of net sales. On a consolidated basis, we did not generate more than 10% of our net sales from any one customer in 2018.
Competition
We compete with other companies on price, service, quality, breadth, and availability of product. We believe we have been able to compete effectively because of our high levels of service, breadth of product offering, knowledgeable and trained sales force, modern equipment, proximity to customers, and economies of scale.
The North American market for brass and copper strip and sheet and brass rod consists of a few large participants and a few smaller competitors for Olin Brass and Chase Brass. A.J. Oster’s competition consists of a number of smaller competitors. Our international competitors are based principally in Europe (for Olin Brass and A.J. Oster) and Asia (for Chase Brass).
10

Our largest competitors in each of the markets in which we operate are the following:

• | Aurubis and PMX Industries, Inc.: manufacturers of copper and copper-alloys in the form of strip, sheet and plate (Olin Brass competitor);


• | ThyssenKrupp Materials NA, Copper and Brass Sales Division: processor and distributor of copper, brass, stainless and aluminum products; Wieland Metals, Inc.: re-roll mill and service center for copper and copper-alloy strip (A.J. Oster competitor); and


• | Mueller Industries, Inc.: manufacturer of brass rod (Chase Brass competitor).

In addition, as previously mentioned, our Chase Brass business is affected by our customers’ ability to compete with finished parts that are imported into the United States.
We use data published by independent industry associations and management estimates to determine our market share. Using this information, in 2018, we estimate our market share as follows:

• | Olin Brass accounted for 31% of North American shipments (including shipments to A.J. Oster) of copper and brass alloys in the form of sheet, strip and plate;


• | A.J. Oster accounted for 42% of North American shipments of copper and brass, sheet and strip products from distribution centers and rerolling facilities; and


• | Chase Brass accounted for 51% of North American shipments of brass rod, not including imports.

Corporate
Our Corporate expenditures include compensation for corporate executives and officers, corporate office and administrative salaries, and professional fees for accounting, unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities, tax, and legal services. Corporate also includes interest expense, state and federal income taxes, overhead costs that management has not allocated to the operating segments, share-based compensation expense, gains and losses associated with certain acquisitions and dispositions and the elimination of intercompany sales and balances.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
Bactericidal Products
Through its membership in and the stewardship program of the Copper Development Association Inc. (“CDA”), Olin Brass has completed the required Federal Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and applicable state registration processes that allow it to market its CuVerro® products with certain approved bactericidal claims. Laboratory testing has shown that bactericidal copper touch surfaces made with CuVerro® kill more than 99.9% of bacteria within two hours. We believe that Olin Brass’s copper-based CuVerro® materials are in compliance, in all material respects, with EPA standards for products recognized by the EPA as having bactericidal properties.
Even though the marketing of copper products as bactericidal started in 2008, the manufacturers of such products are still in the process of determining what specific bactericidal claims may be made in compliance with the EPA’s and Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act’s (“FIFRA”) requirements. Therefore, there remains some uncertainty when determining whether a particular marketing approach is consistent with the EPA registration requirements. The stewardship program required under the EPA registration is an industry-wide activity, and the actions of other CDA members could jeopardize the marketing of all bactericidal copper products registered through the CDA (including CuVerro®).
Environmental
Our operations are subject to a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and to workplace health and safety. In particular, our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the creation, transportation, use, release and disposal of wastes, air and water emissions, the storage and handling of hazardous substances, environmental protection, remediation, workplace exposure and other matters. Hazardous materials used in and activities undertaken by our operations include general commercial lubricants, cleaning solvents, cutting oils, air emissions from paints and coatings, storage of hazardous materials, and utilization of septic systems.
11

We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental, workplace health, and safety laws and do not currently anticipate that we will be required to expend any substantial amounts in the foreseeable future in order to meet such requirements. We have a number of properties located in or near heavy industrial or light industrial use areas; accordingly, these properties may have been contaminated by pollutants which may have migrated from neighboring facilities or have been released by prior occupants for which we may become liable under various laws and regulations. Some of our properties have been affected by releases of cutting oils and similar materials and we are investigating and remediating such known contamination pursuant to applicable environmental laws. The costs of these clean-ups have not been material in the past.
In January 2018, one of our Olin Brass operations experienced a leak of mineral oil at its Waterbury, Connecticut facility. Our personnel, the Waterbury fire department, the U.S. EPA, the Connecticut DEEP, and remediation contractors responded immediately. We incurred approximately $0.7 million of expenses in 2018 associated with this leak and also reached a final settlement with the U.S. EPA, which resulted in a $6,000 fine. We remain in discussions with the Connecticut DEEP regarding ongoing remediation activity. We do not believe this incident will materially affect our long-term financial stability or cash flows.
Pursuant to the agreement, dated November 19, 2007, by which we purchased our current operating locations from Olin Corporation, Olin Corporation agreed to retain responsibility for a wide range of liabilities under environmental laws arising out of existing contamination on our properties, and agreed to indemnify us without limitation with respect to these liabilities. Specifically, Olin Corporation retained responsibility for:

• | compliance with all obligations to perform investigations and remedial action required under the Connecticut Real Property Transfer Act at properties in Connecticut;


• | pending corrective action / compliance obligations under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act for certain areas of concern at our East Alton, Illinois facility; and


• | all obligations under environmental laws arising out of 24 additional specifically identified areas of concern on various of our properties.

Olin Corporation also retained complete responsibility for all liabilities arising out of then pending governmental inquiries relating to environmental matters; for “any liability or obligation in connection with a facility of the Business to the extent related to pre-Closing human exposure to Hazardous Materials, including asbestos-containing materials”; and for “any liability or obligation in connection with the off-site transportation or disposal of Hazardous Materials arising out of any pre-Closing operations of the Business.”
Since 2007, Olin Corporation has continued to perform environmental remedial actions on our properties, including the East Alton, Illinois and Waterbury, Connecticut properties, and continues to work closely with us to address matters covered by the indemnity. Because of the Olin Corporation indemnity, we have not been required to engage in any significant environmental cleanup activity on our properties and do not currently have any material reserves established to address environmental remedial requirements.
Employees
The following table shows the composition of our workforce by operating segment and Corporate as of December 31, 2018.

 | Employees | % of Total
Olin Brass | 1,093 | | 58 | %
A.J. Oster | 433 | | 23 | %
Chase Brass | 335 | | 18 | %
Corporate | 21 | | 1 | %
Total | 1,882 | | 100 | %

As of December 31, 2018, 1,021, or approximately 54%, of our employees at various sites were members of unions. We have generally maintained good relationships with all unions and employees, which has been an important aspect of our ability to be competitive in our industry. Generally, our various agreements with unions in the United States have contractual terms which range from 3 to 5 years.
12

Historically, we have succeeded in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements without a strike and we have not experienced any work stoppages at any of our facilities. Our union agreement governing a substantial portion of our employees at Olin Brass was renewed in 2017 and expires in 2022. We believe we will continue to be able to renew the outstanding collective bargaining agreements upon acceptable terms. 
Research and Development
Our staff of scientists in metallurgy and electrochemistry continues to research and develop new products and expand our value-added services to meet our customers’ needs. Our research and development expenditures were not material in any of the last three years.
Risk Management and Insurance
The primary risks in our operations are personal injury, property damage, transportation, criminal acts, risks associated with international operations, directors’ and officers’ liability, cybersecurity, product recall, and general commercial liabilities. We are insured against general commercial liabilities (including business interruption), cybersecurity, product recall, workers’ compensation liabilities, automobile accidents (including injury to employees and physical damage of goods and property and employer liabilities), directors’ and officers’ liability, crime, foreign risks, environmental liability, ocean cargo liability and flood through insurance policies provided by various insurance companies up to amounts we consider sufficient to protect against losses due to claims associated with these risks.
Safety
Consistent with other strategic initiatives, we strive to achieve a ‘Best in Class’ performance status for employee safety. A number of our locations participate in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) sponsored Voluntary Protection Program, or VPP. The Safety Excellence / VPP initiative shifts the safety paradigm to an aggressive proactive approach that stresses strong employee participation and collaboration, management accountability, employee training and hazard elimination as core foundational elements. In 2018, our A.J. Oster facilities in Alliance, Ohio and Carol Stream, Illinois were recognized as VPP Star sites. In 2016, our A.J. Oster facility in Yorba Linda, California was recognized as a VPP Star site. This recognition reflects the facility’s achievement in the development, implementation and continuous improvement of their safety and health management system resulting in injury and illness rates that are below the national averages for the industry.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property Rights
Chase Brass has exclusive intellectual property licenses, the longest of which extends to 2027, to produce and sell Eco Brass® rod and ingot in North America, granted by Mitsubishi Shindoh Company, Ltd., the Japanese company that owns the relevant intellectual property rights. The most popular versions of Eco Brass® are protected through May 2019. We have sublicensed our rights to three sublicensees, none of which is currently a competitor of any of our subsidiaries or segments. These sublicensing arrangements are valid until the expiration of the relevant patents in North America.
We license certain intellectual property from companies in Germany, Japan and China.
We own a number of other U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and licenses relating to certain of our products and processes. We actively protect our proprietary rights by the use of trademark, copyright, and patent registrations. Additionally, we license the marks OLIN BRASS and OLIN METALS for metal products from Olin Corporation. These licenses continue unless we breach the license agreement. We also license stylized versions of these marks from Olin Corporation and the license to the stylized version includes an annual termination option by either party.
We license the intellectual property rights related to certain proprietary alloy systems to other major brass mills around the world, including Dowa Metaltech. 
Government Contract
The United States Mint is and has been a significant customer of Olin Brass since 1969. We have a contractual arrangement to supply nickel and brass coinage strip to multiple United States Mint facilities. We renewed this contract in 2017 and expect to renew it again when it expires in 2022. However, the United States Mint can terminate our contract in whole or in part when it is in the best interest of the United States Mint to do so and any damages payable to us by the United States Mint for such termination would not include lost profits.

Seasonality
There is a slight decrease in our net sales in the fourth quarter as a result of the decrease in demand due to customer shutdowns for the holidays and our customers’ year-end maintenance activities and working capital management. We also typically experience slight working capital increases in the first fiscal quarter as our customers build inventory to serve the seasonal building and housing market.
