     ITEM 1.BUSINESS
     Overview
     Granite Falls Energy, LLC is a Minnesota limited liability company formed on December 29, 2000 for the purpose of constructing, owning and operating a fuel-grade ethanol plant located in Granite Falls, Minnesota.  
     In July 2013, we acquired controlling interest in Heron Lake BioEnergy, LLC (“Heron Lake BioEnergy” or “HLBE”), which owns an ethanol plant located near Heron Lake, Minnesota. As of October 31, 2018, we control approximately 50.7% of HLBE’s outstanding membership units through our wholly owned subsidiary, Project Viking, L.L.C. As a result of our majority ownership, we have the right to appoint five (5) of the nine (9) governors to HLBE’s board of governors under its member control agreement.
     On November 1, 2016, we subscribed to purchase 1,500 capital units of Ring-neck Energy & Feed, LLC (“Ringneck”) at a price of $5,000 per unit for a total of $7,500,000 and paid a subscription deposit of $750,000.  By letter dated July 12, 2017, GFE was notified of Ringneck’s acceptance of GFE’s subscription. On August 2, 2017, GFE borrowed $7.5 million under its credit facility with Project Hawkeye, LLC (“Project Hawkeye”), an affiliate of Fagen, Inc., which is a member of GFE, and paid $6,750,000 to Ringneck as payment of the remaining balance of GFE’s subscription. Details regarding our subscription for investment in Ringneck are provided below in the section titled “Investments.” Details of the Project Hawkeye credit facility are provided below in the section below entitled “ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Indebtedness - Granite Falls Energy - GFE’s Other Credit Arrangement.”
     On June 29, 2018, we subscribed to purchase 20 preferred membership units of Harvestone Group, LLC (“Harvestone”) at a price of $100,000 per unit for a total of $2,000,000. We paid the $2,000,000 in connection with our subscription, which is reflected in our investing cash flows. Harvestone is a Delaware limited liability company that provides ethanol marketing, logistics, and trading services. Harvestone’s headquarters are located in Franklin, Tennessee. Harvestone is owned by several other ethanol producers and other private investors and expects that its primary business

will be marketing and trading for member and non-member ethanol producers. GFE’s investment is sufficient to grant it the right to appoint one advisor to the advisory committee to the managers of Harvestone. Details regarding our subscription for investment in Harvestone are provided below in the section titled “Investments.” 
     Our business consists primarily of the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products (wet, modified wet and dried distillers’ grains, corn oil and corn syrup) locally, and throughout the continental U.S. However, as markets allow, our products can be, and have been, sold in the export markets.  Our revenues from operations come from three primary sources: sales of fuel ethanol, sales of distillers’ grains and sales of corn oil at GFE’s ethanol plant and HLBE’s ethanol plant.  
     Our Facilities
     Our business consists primarily of producing ethanol and its related co-products, including wet, modified and dried distillers’ grains, as well as corn oil. Our ethanol production operations are carried out at our ethanol plant located in Granite Falls, Minnesota and at the ethanol plant operated by HLBE located near Heron Lake, Minnesota. 
     The GFE plant has an annual nameplate production capacity of approximately 63 million gallons of denatured ethanol, but is currently permitted to produce up to 70 million gallons of undenatured ethanol on a twelve-month rolling sum basis. The HLBE plant has an approximate annual nameplate production capacity of approximately 65 million gallons of denatured ethanol, but is currently permitted to produce up to approximately 72.3 million gallons of undenatured fuel-grade ethanol on a twelve-month rolling sum basis.  We intend to continue working toward increasing production at both the GFE and HLBE plants to take advantage of the additional production allowed pursuant to our permits as long as we believe it is profitable to do so.
     HLBE also owns a controlling 73.0% interest in Agrinatural Gas, LLC (“Agrinatural”), through its wholly owned subsidiary, HLBE Pipeline Company, LLC. The remaining 27.0% non-controlling interest is owned by Rural Energy Solutions, LLC (“RES”).  Agrinatural is a natural gas pipeline company that was formed to construct, own, and operate the natural gas pipeline that provides natural gas to HLBE’s ethanol production facility and other customers through a connection with the natural gas pipeline facilities of Northern Border Pipeline Company in Cottonwood County, Minnesota. Agrinatural owns approximately 190 miles of natural gas pipeline and provides natural gas to HLBE’s ethanol plant and other commercial, agricultural and residential customers through a connection with the natural gas pipeline facilities of Northern Border Pipeline Company. Agrinatural’s revenues are generated through natural gas distribution fees and sales. HLBE is its largest customer by volume and revenue.
     Operating Segments
     Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 280, “Segment Reporting,” establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Therefore, in applying the criteria set forth in ASC 280, the Company determined that based on the nature of the products and production process and the expected financial results, the Company’s operations at GFE’s ethanol plant and HLBE’s plant, including the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products, are aggregated into one reporting segment.
     Additionally, we also realize relatively immaterial revenue from natural gas pipeline operations at Agrinatural, HLBE’s majority owned subsidiary.  Before and after accounting for intercompany eliminations, these revenues from Agrinatural represent less than 1% of our consolidated gross revenues and have little to no impact on the overall performance of the Company.  Therefore, our management does not separately review Agrinatural’s revenues, cost of sales or other operating performance information.  Rather, management reviews Agrinatural’s natural gas pipeline financial data on a consolidated basis with our ethanol production operating segment. Additionally, management believes that the presentation of separate operating performance information for Agrinatural’s natural gas pipeline operations would not provide meaningful information to a reader of the Company’s financial statements and would not achieve the basic principles and objectives of ASC 280.
     We currently do not have or anticipate we will have any other lines of business or other significant sources of revenue other than the sale of ethanol and its co-products, which include distillers’ grains and non-edible corn oil.

 Financial Information
     Please refer to “ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for information about our revenue, profit and loss measurements, and total assets and liabilities and “ITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” for our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data.     Principal Products
     The principal products from ethanol production at GFE’s plant and HLBE’s plant, and from which we derive nearly all our revenue, are fuel-grade ethanol, distillers’ grains, and non-edible corn oil.  In addition, HLBE’s plant also has miscellaneous other revenue generated by sales of corn syrup, a by-product of the ethanol production process, and revenues from Agrinatural’s natural gas pipeline operations.  We did not introduce any new products or services as part of our ethanol production segment during our fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.  
     The table below shows the approximate percentage of our total revenue which is attributable to each of our principal products for each of the last three fiscal years.
    
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Ethanol | 76.0 | % | | 81.1 | % | 79.3 | %
Distillers' Grains | 19.0 | % | | 13.6 | % | 15.8 | %
Corn Oil | 3.9 | % | | 4.5 | % | 4.1 | %
Misc. Other Revenue* | 1.1 | % | | 0.8 | % | 0.8 | %

      *Includes incidental sales of corn syrup at HLBE’s plant and revenues from natural gas pipeline operations at Agrinatural, net of intercompany eliminations for distribution fees paid by HLBE to Agrinatural for natural gas transportation services.
     Ethanol
     Ethanol is a type of alcohol produced in the U.S. principally from corn.  Ethanol is ethyl alcohol, a fuel component made primarily from corn in the U.S. but can also be produced from various other grains. Ethanol is primarily used as:
· | an octane enhancer in fuels;
--+-----------------------------


· | an oxygenated fuel additive that can reduce ozone and carbon monoxide vehicle emissions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a non-petroleum-based gasoline substitute; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | as a renewable fuel to displace consumption of imported oil.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

      Ethanol produced in the U.S. is primarily used for blending with unleaded gasoline and other fuel products as an octane enhancer or fuel additive.  Ethanol is most commonly sold as E10 (10% ethanol and 90% gasoline), which is the blend of ethanol approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) for use in all American automobiles. Increasingly, ethanol is also available as E85, a higher percentage ethanol blend (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) approved by the EPA for use in flexible fuel vehicles.
     Distillers’ Grains
     The principal co-product of the ethanol production process is distillers’ grains, a high protein and high-energy animal feed ingredient primarily marketed to the dairy and beef industries.  Dry mill ethanol processing creates three primary forms of distillers’ grains: wet distillers’ grains, modified wet distillers’ grains, and dried distillers’ grains with solubles.  Most of the distillers’ grains that we sell are in the form of dried distillers’ grains and modified/wet distillers’ grains.  Modified/wet distillers’ grains are processed corn mash that has been dried to approximately 50% moisture and has a shelf life of approximately 7 days. Modified/wet distillers’ grains are often sold to nearby markets. Dried distillers’ grains with solubles are corn mash that has been dried to approximately 10% to 12% moisture.  It has an almost indefinite shelf life and may be sold and shipped to any market and fed to almost all types of livestock.

 Corn Oil
     We also extract non-edible crude corn oil during the thin stillage evaporation process immediately prior to production of distillers’ grains.  The corn oil that we produce is not food grade corn oil and therefore cannot be used for human consumption. Corn oil is used primarily as a biodiesel feedstock and as a supplement for animal feed.     Principal Product Markets
     As described below in “Distribution of Principal Products”, we market and distribute all of GFE’s and HLBE’s ethanol, distillers’ grains, and corn oil through professional third party marketers.  Our marketers make all decisions with regard to where our products are marketed and we have little control over the marketing decisions they make.  
     Our ethanol, distillers’ grains and corn oil are primarily sold in the domestic market; however, as markets allow, our products can be, and have been, sold in the export markets. We expect our ethanol and distillers’ grains marketers to explore all markets for our products, including export markets. We believe that there is some potential for increased international sales of our products. Nevertheless, due to high transportation costs, and the fact that we are not located near a major international shipping port, we expect a majority of our products to continue to be marketed and sold domestically.
     Ethanol Markets
     The markets in which our ethanol is sold will depend primarily upon the efforts of Eco-Energy, Inc. (“Eco-Energy”), which buys and markets our ethanol. There are local, regional, national, and international markets for ethanol.  The principal markets for our ethanol are petroleum terminals in the continental U.S. The principal purchasers of ethanol are generally wholesale gasoline distributors or blenders.
     We believe that local markets will be limited and must typically be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  Although local markets may be the easiest to service, they may be oversold because of the number of ethanol producers near our plants, which may depress the price of ethanol in those markets.
     Typically, a regional market is one that is outside of the local market, yet within the neighboring states.  Some regional markets include large cities that are subject to anti-smog measures in either carbon monoxide or ozone non-attainment areas, or that have implemented oxygenated gasoline programs, such as Chicago, St. Louis, Denver, and Minneapolis.  We consider our primary regional market to be large cities within a 450-mile radius of our ethanol plants.  In the national ethanol market, the highest demand by volume is primarily in the southern U.S. and the east and west coast regions.
     We expect a majority of our ethanol to continue to be marketed and sold domestically. In addition, as domestic production of ethanol continues to expand, we anticipate increased international sales. Over our past fiscal year, exports of ethanol have increased with Brazil receiving the largest percentage of ethanol produced in the United States and Canada in second place. India, China, Netherlands, South Korea, and Philippines have also been top destinations.  However, ethanol export demand is more unpredictable than domestic demand and tends to fluctuate over time as it is subject to monetary and political forces in other nations. For example, a strong US Dollar is a force that may negatively impact ethanol exports from the United States.  Additionally, the imposition of tariffs and duties on imported ethanol from the U.S. can also negatively impact domestic export demand.
     Although exports to China substantially increased during 2016 over 2015, China imported comparatively negligible volumes during both 2017 and 2018.  This reduction is due to China’s increase of the tariff on ethanol imported from the U.S. to 45% as of April 2, 2018, compared to the previous 30% tariff imposed in 2017, and the subsequent increase of the 45% tariff to 70% as of July 6, 2018.  Notably, on September 13, 2017, China’s National Development and Reform Commission, the National Energy Board and 15 other state departments issued a joint plan to expand the use and production of biofuels containing up to 10% ethanol by 2020. It is unclear whether China will be able to meet the 10% target without importing US ethanol. However, there is no assurance the recently issued joint plan will lead to increased imports of US ethanol. 
     During 2017, Brazil also adopted import quotas on imported ethanol, which negatively impacted U.S. exports to Brazil. The import quota imposed a 20% tariff on U.S. ethanol imports in excess of 150 million liters, or 39.6 million gallons per quarter. The tariff is valid for two years, which means that it is due to expire in September 2019. U.S. exports 

 
  6

 
to Brazil have remained steady from our 2017 fiscal year to our 2018 fiscal year. However, this tariff may continue to have a negative impact on the export market demand and prices for ethanol produced in the United States.
     We transport our ethanol primarily by rail.  In addition to rail, we service certain regional markets by truck from time to time.  We believe that regional pricing tends to follow national pricing less the freight difference.
     Distillers’ Grains Markets
     We sell distillers’ grains as animal feed for beef and dairy cattle, poultry, and hogs. Most of the distillers’ grains that we sell are in the form of dried distillers’ grains.  Currently, the U.S. ethanol industry exports a significant amount of dried distillers’ grains, which may increase as worldwide acceptance grows. According to the U.S. Grains Council, total U.S. distiller’s grains exports through October 2018 were approximately 7.7% higher than distiller’s grains exports for the same period last year. Top export markets include Mexico, the European Union, Vietnam, Thailand, and South Korea. 
      Historically, the United States ethanol industry exported a significant amount of distillers’ grains to China and Vietnam. However, during 2016, China began an anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigation related to distillers’ grains imported from the U.S. which contributed to a decline in distillers’ grains shipped to China during 2016. In January 2017, the Chinese issued final tariffs on U.S. distillers’ grains. The Chinese distillers’ grains anti-dumping tariffs range from 42.2% to 53.7% and the anti-subsidy tariffs range from 11.2% to 12%. The imposition of these duties has resulted in a significant decline in demand from this top importer requiring U.S. producers to seek out alternative markets. Exports to China within the last year have grown markedly but are still substantially below the pre-tariff export level. There is no guarantee that distillers’ grains exports to Chinese will resume.
     We also sell modified wet distillers’ grains, which typically have a shelf life of a maximum of seven days.  This provides for a much smaller, more local market and makes the timing of its sale critical. Further, because of its moisture content, the modified wet distillers’ grains are heavier and more difficult to handle. The customer must be close enough to justify the additional handling and shipping costs. As a result, modified wet distillers’ grains are principally sold only to local feedlots and livestock operations.
     Various factors affect the price of distillers’ grain, including, among others, the price of corn, soybean meal and other alternative feed products, the performance or value of distillers’ grains in a particular feed market, and the supply and demand within the market.  Like other commodities, the price of distillers’ grains can fluctuate significantly.
     Corn Oil Markets
     Our corn oil is primarily sold to diesel manufacturers and, to a lesser extent, feed lot and poultry markets. We generally transport our corn oil by truck to users located primarily in the upper Midwest.     Distribution of Principal Products
     GFE’s ethanol plant is located near Granite Falls, Minnesota, in Chippewa County.  It is served by the TC&W Railway which provides connection to the Canadian Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroads. The completion of our rail loop during our 2012 fiscal year enables us to load unit trains.  Our site is in close proximity to major highways that connect to major population centers such as Minneapolis, Minnesota; Chicago, Illinois; and Detroit, Michigan.
     HLBE’s ethanol plant is located near Heron Lake, Minnesota. It is served by the Union Pacific Railroad. HLBE’s site is also in close proximity to major highways that connect to major population centers such as Minneapolis, Minnesota; Chicago, Illinois; and Detroit, Michigan.
     Ethanol Distribution
     Eco-Energy is the ethanol marketer for both the GFE plant and HLBE plant. Pursuant to our marketing agreements, Eco-Energy purchases and markets the entire ethanol output of GFE’s and HLBE’s ethanol plants.  Under GFE’s ethanol marketing agreement, GFE is responsible for securing all of the rail cars necessary for the transport of ethanol by rail except for 59 rail cars leased to GFE by Eco-Energy. Under HLBE’s ethanol marketing agreement, Eco-Energy arranges for the transportation of HLBE’s ethanol. GFE and HLBE pay Eco-Energy a marketing fee per gallon of 

 
  7

 
ethanol sold, as well as a fixed lease fee for rail cars leased from Eco-Energy. The marketing fee and timing of payments by Eco-Energy were negotiated based on prevailing market-rate conditions for comparable ethanol marketing services.
     Our agreements with Eco-Energy expire on December 31, 2019.  However, the agreements provide for automatic renewals for three additional terms of three-years each unless terminated by either party by providing written notice to the other party at least 90 days prior to the end of the then current term.  
     Distillers’ Grains Distribution
     RPMG, Inc. (“RPMG”) is the distillers’ grains marketer for our Granite Falls plant.  Pursuant to GFE’s distillers’ grains marketing agreement, RPMG markets all the distillers’ grains produced at the Granite Falls plant.  The contract commenced on February 1, 2011, with an initial term of one year, and will continue in effect until terminated by either party at its unqualified option, by providing written notice of not less than 90 days to the other party.
     Gavilon Ingredients, LLC (“Gavilon”) is the distillers’ grains marketer for HLBE.  Under HLBE’s distillers’ grains marketing agreement, Gavilon purchases all of the distillers’ grains produced at our Heron Lake ethanol plant in exchange for a service fee. The contract commenced on November 1, 2013 with an initial term of six months, and will continue to remain in effect until terminated by either party at its unqualified option, by providing written notice of not less than 60 days to the other party.
     Corn Oil Distribution
     RPMG is also the corn oil marketer for both the GFE plant and the HLBE plant.  Currently, RPMG markets our corn oil, which is used primarily as a biodiesel feedstock and as a supplement for animal feed.  We pay RPMG a commission based on each pound of corn oil sold by RPMG under these marketing agreements. The contract for GFE commenced on April 29, 2010, and the contract for HLBE commenced on November 1, 2013. Both contracts have an initial term of one year, and will continue in effect until terminated by either party at its unqualified option, by providing written notice of not less than 90 days to the other party.     Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
     As discussed above, we have exclusive ethanol marketing agreements with Eco-Energy. Additionally, we have agreements with RPMG and Gavilon to market all of the distillers’ grains produced at GFE’s plant and HLBE’s plant, respectively, and with RPMG to market all of the corn oil produced at our plants. We rely on Eco-Energy, RPMG and Gavilon for the sale and distribution of all of our products; therefore, we are highly dependent on Eco-Energy, RPMG and Gavilon for the successful marketing of our products. Any loss of these companies as our marketing agents for our ethanol, distillers’ grains, or corn oil could have a negative impact on our revenues.     Seasonality of Ethanol Sales
     We experience some seasonality of demand for our ethanol. Since ethanol is predominantly blended with conventional gasoline for use in automobiles, ethanol demand tends to shift in relation to gasoline demand.  As a result, we experience some seasonality of demand for ethanol in the summer months related to increased driving.  In addition, we experience some increased ethanol demand during holiday seasons related to increased gasoline demand.
     Pricing of Corn and Ethanol
     We expect that ethanol sales will represent our primary revenue source and corn will represent our primary component of cost of goods sold.  Therefore, changes in the price at which we can sell the ethanol we produce and the price at which we buy corn for our ethanol plants present significant operational risks inherent in our business. Trends in ethanol prices and corn prices are subject to a number of factors and are difficult to predict.
     The price and availability of corn is subject to significant fluctuations depending upon a number of factors that affect commodity prices in general, including crop conditions, yields, domestic and global stocks, weather, federal policy and foreign trade. With the volatility of the weather and commodity markets, we cannot predict the future price of corn. Historically, ethanol prices have tended to correlate with corn prices, wholesale gasoline prices, with demand for and the 

 
  8

 
price of ethanol increasing as supplies of petroleum decreased or appeared to be threatened, crude oil prices increased and wholesale gasoline prices increased. However, the prices of both ethanol and corn do not always follow historical trends.  
     Generally, higher corn prices will produce lower profit margins and, therefore, negatively affect our financial performance.  If a period of high corn prices were to be sustained for some time, such pricing may reduce our ability to operate profitably because of the higher cost of operating our plants.  Because the market price of ethanol is not directly related to corn prices, we, like most ethanol producers, are not able to compensate for increases in the cost of corn through adjustments in our prices for our ethanol although we do see increases in the prices of our distillers’ grains during times of higher corn prices. Given that ethanol sales comprise a majority of our revenues, our inability to adjust our ethanol prices can result in a negative impact on our profitability during periods of high corn prices.
     Ethanol prices were lower during fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017.  Ethanol prices were lower during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 due to increased ethanol output and excess supply.  Management expects additional volatility for the price of ethanol in 2019.  Ethanol supply is projected to level out in 2019, and demand is expected to increase in 2019. However, there is no guarantee that either of these patterns will occur. Due to low ethanol and feedstock prices, exports grew in 2018 and are projected to continue to grow in 2019.  This is positive for the ethanol industry, but does introduce additional risk as international demand is more volatile than domestic demand.  U.S. gas demand was flat year over year in 2018, while ethanol as a percentage of the fuel supply remained steady.  Ethanol consumption is projected to increase slightly in 2019; however, there is no guarantee that this projection will be accurate. A decrease in demand for either gasoline or ethanol blends would adversely impact the price of ethanol, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
     Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
     The primary raw materials used in the production of ethanol at our plants are corn and natural gas.  Our plants also require significant and uninterrupted amounts of electricity and water.       Corn
     Ethanol production requires substantial amounts of corn. The cost of corn represented approximately 71.4%, 72.2%, and 74.1% of our cost of goods sold for the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. At GFE’s current production rate of approximately 63 million gallons of undenatured ethanol per year, the GFE plant requires approximately 21.5 million bushels of corn per year. The HLBE ethanol plant requires approximately 22.5 million bushels of corn per year to operate at its current production rate of approximately 65 million gallons of undenatured ethanol per year.  
    
GFE had an exclusive corn storage and grain handling agreement with Farmers Cooperative Elevator (“FCE”), a member of GFE. Under the agreement, GFE had agreed to purchase all of the corn needed for the operation of the plant from FCE. The price of the corn purchased was the bid price FCE establishes for the plant plus a set fee per bushel. 
     On February 27, 2017, GFE and FCE executed an amendment to the corn storage and grain handling agreement.  Pursuant to the terms of the amendment, GFE and FCE agreed to amend the corn storage and grain handling agreement to accelerate the termination date of the agreement to midnight August 31, 2017.  In exchange for the early termination, GFE paid an early termination fee to FCE of approximately $255,000 in August 2017. Prior to the amendment, the termination date of the corn storage and grain handling agreement was set to expire on November 2017.
     On June 1, 2017, GFE began posting bids for the purchase of corn directly from grain elevators, farmers, and local dealers within approximately 80 miles of Granite Falls, Minnesota.  On September 1, 2017, GFE began accepting delivery of corn at its Granite Falls plant.  Typically, HLBE purchases its corn directly from grain elevators, farmers, and local dealers within approximately 80 miles of Heron Lake, Minnesota. Neither GFE’s nor HLBE’s members are obligated to deliver corn to the Granite Falls plant or Heron Lake plant.  
     GFE and HLBE generally purchase corn through spot cash, fixed-price forward, basis only, and futures only contracts. Our fixed-price forward contracts specify the amount of corn, the price and the time period over which the corn is to be delivered.  These forward contracts are at fixed prices indexed to Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”) prices. Our plants corn requirements can be contracted in advance under fixed-price forward contracts or options. The parameters of these contracts are based on the local supply and demand situation and the seasonality of the price. For delayed pricing 

 
  9

 
contracts, producers will deliver corn to either the GFE or HLBE plant, but the pricing for that corn and the related payment will occur at a later date. We may also purchase a portion of our corn on a spot basis. For our spot purchases, GFE and HLBE post daily corn bids so that corn producers can sell to directly to our plants on a spot basis.  
     In addition, both plants’ facilities have sufficient corn storage capacity, with the capability to store approximately 8 days of corn supply at HLBE and approximately 18 days of corn supply at the GFE plant. 
     We compete with ethanol producers in close proximity for the supplies of corn we will require to operate our plants.  There are 8 ethanol plants within an approximate 50 mile radius of HLBE’s plant and 5 ethanol plants within an approximate 50 mile radius of the GFE plant. The existence of other ethanol plants, particularly those in close proximity to our plants, increase the demand for corn and may result in higher costs for supplies of corn. We also compete with other users of corn, including ethanol producers regionally and nationally, producers of food and food ingredients for human consumption (such as high fructose corn syrup, starches, and sweeteners), producers of animal feed and industrial users.
     Since corn is the primary raw material we use to produce our products, the availability and cost of corn can have a significant impact on the profitability of our operations. Corn prices were lower during the first, second, and third quarters of our 2018 fiscal year, as compared to our 2017 fiscal year, as a result of several consecutive years of favorable corn crops. Corn prices were higher during the fourth quarter of our 2018 fiscal year, as compared to our 2017 fiscal year, due to strong demand and potential weather threats. If we experience a drought or other unfavorable weather condition during our 2019 fiscal year, the price we pay for corn and the availability of corn near our plants could be negatively impacted. If we experience a localized shortage of corn, we may be forced to purchase corn from producers who are farther away from our ethanol plants which can increase our transportation costs. 
     Utilities
     Natural Gas
     Natural gas is a significant input to our manufacturing process. The cost of natural gas represented approximately 6.0%, 6.3%, and 5.1%, of our cost of sales for the years ended October 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
     We do not anticipate any problems securing the natural gas we require to continue to operate our plants at capacity during our 2019 fiscal year or beyond. At GFE’s plant, we pay Center Point Energy/Minnegasco a per unit fee to move the natural gas through the pipeline, and we have guaranteed to move a minimum of 1,500,000 mmBTU annually through December 31, 2025, which is the ending date of the agreement.  GFE also has an agreement with Kinetic Energy Group. On our behalf, Kinetic Energy Group procures contracts with various natural gas vendors to supply the natural gas necessary to operate the GFE plant.  We determined that sourcing our natural gas from a variety of vendors is more cost-efficient than using an exclusive supplier.
     HLBE has a facilities agreement with Northern Border Pipeline Company, which allows HLBE to access an existing interstate natural gas pipeline located approximately 16 miles north from its plant.  HLBE has entered into a firm natural gas transportation agreement with its majority owned subsidiary, Agrinatural.  Under the terms of the firm natural gas transportation agreement, Agrinatural will provide natural gas to the HLBE plant with a specified price per MMBTU for a term ending on October 31, 2021, with an automatic renewal option for an additional five year period.  HLBE also has a base agreement for the sale and purchase of natural gas with Constellation NewEnergy—Gas Division, LLC (“Constellation”). HLBE buys all of its natural gas from Constellation and this agreement runs through March 31, 2022.
     The prices for and availability of natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions.  These market conditions often are affected by factors beyond our control such as higher prices as a result of colder than average weather conditions or natural disasters, overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulations and relations.  Significant disruptions in the supply of natural gas could impair our ability to manufacture ethanol and more significantly, dried distillers’ grains for our customers.  Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices or changes in our natural gas costs relative to natural gas costs paid by competitors may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

 Electricity
     Our plants require a continuous supply of electricity.  We have agreements in place to supply electricity to our plants. Our GFE plant obtains electricity from Minnesota Valley Light and Power Cooperative, and our HLBE plant obtains electricity from Federated Rural Electric. We do not anticipate any problems securing the electricity that we require to continue to operate our plants at capacity during our 2019 fiscal year or beyond.     Water
     We do not anticipate any problems securing the water that we require to continue to operate our plants at capacity during our 2019 fiscal year or beyond. GFE obtains the water necessary to operate its plant from the Minnesota River with an adjustable gravity-flow intake system.
     HLBE obtains its water pursuant to an industrial water supply agreement with the City of Heron Lake and Jackson County, Minnesota.
     Risk Management and Hedging
     The profitability of our operations is highly dependent on the impact of market fluctuations associated with commodity prices.  We use various derivative instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk and to reduce the risk that our ethanol production will become unprofitable when market prices among our principal commodities and products do not correlate.  
     In order to mitigate our commodity and product price risks, we enter into hedging transactions, including forward corn, ethanol, distillers’ grains and natural gas contracts, in an attempt to partially offset the effects of price volatility for corn and ethanol.  However, we are not always presented with an opportunity to lock in a favorable margin and our plant’s profitability may be negatively impacted during periods of high grain prices. We also enter into over-the-counter and exchange-traded futures, swaps and option contracts for corn, ethanol and distillers’ grains, designed to limit our exposure to increases in the price of corn and manage ethanol price fluctuations.  
    
Although we believe that our hedging strategies can reduce the risk of price fluctuations, the financial statement impact of these activities depends upon, among other things, the prices involved and our ability to physically receive or deliver the commodities involved.  Our hedging activities could cause net income to be volatile from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the change in value of the derivative instruments relative to the cost and use of the commodity being hedged.  As corn and ethanol prices move in reaction to market trends and information, our income statement will be affected depending on the impact such market movements have on the value of our derivative instruments.
     Hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in situations where the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults or, in the case of exchange-traded contracts, where there is a change in the expected differential between the price of the commodity underlying the hedging agreement and the actual prices paid or received by us for the physical commodity bought or sold.  There are also situations where the hedging transactions themselves may result in losses, as when a position is purchased in a declining market or a position is sold in a rising market. Hedging losses may be offset by a decreased cash price for corn and natural gas and an increased cash price for ethanol and distillers’ grains.
     We have established a risk management committee which assists the board and our risk management manager to, among other things, establish appropriate policies and strategies for hedging and enterprise risk. We continually monitor and manage our commodity risk exposure and our hedging transactions as part of our overall risk management policy.  As a result, we may vary the amount of hedging or other risk mitigation strategies we undertake, and we may choose not to engage in hedging transactions.  Our ability to hedge is always subject to our liquidity and available capital.
     Process Improvement
     We are continually working to develop new methods of operating the ethanol plants more efficiently.  We continue to conduct process improvement activities in order to realize these efficiency improvements.

 Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions
     We do not currently hold any patents, trademarks, franchises, or concessions.  We were granted a license by ICM, Inc. (“ICM”) to use certain ethanol production technology necessary to operate our ethanol plants.  The cost of the license granted by ICM was included in the amount we paid to Fagen, Inc. to design and build our ethanol plants.     Competition
     Ethanol Competition
     Domestic Competition
     We sell our ethanol in a highly competitive market.  Ethanol is a commodity product where competition in the industry is predominantly based on price. On a national scale, we are in direct competition with numerous other ethanol producers.  According to the Renewable Fuels Association (“RFA”), as of November 15, 2018, there are approximately 217 biorefineries with a total nameplate capacity of approximately 16.5 billion gallons of ethanol per year, with an additional eight plants under expansion or construction with capacity to produce an additional 258 million gallons.  However, the RFA estimates that approximately 3.2% of the ethanol production capacity in the U.S. was not operating as of November 15, 2018.  
     The following table identifies the top five largest ethanol producers in the U.S. along with their production capacities.
    
 | Nameplate Capacity
Company | (mmgy) 
Archer Daniels Midland | 1,716 
POET Biorefining | 1,711 
Green Plains, Inc. | 1,408 
Valero Renewable Fuels | 1,400 
Flint Hills Resources LP | 840 

  Updated: November 15, 2018, Renewable Fuels Association
     Each of the large ethanol producers above are capable of producing significantly more ethanol than we produce. These producers and other large producers are, among other things, capable of producing a significantly greater amount of ethanol or have multiple ethanol plants that may help them achieve certain benefits that we could not achieve with one ethanol plant. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage to other ethanol producers.
     Larger ethanol producers may have an advantage over us from economies of scale and stronger negotiating positions with purchasers.  Large producers own multiple ethanol plants and may have flexibility to run certain facilities while shutting or slowing down production at their other facilities. This added flexibility may allow these producers to compete more effectively, especially during periods when operating margins are unfavorable in the ethanol industry. Some large producers own ethanol plants in geographically diverse areas of the U.S. and as result, may be able to more effectively spread the risk they encounter related to feedstock prices. Some of our competitors are owned subsidiaries of larger oil companies, such as Valero Renewable Fuels and Flint Hills Resources. Because their parent oil companies are required to blend a certain amount of ethanol each year, these competitors may be able to operate their ethanol production facilities at times when it is unprofitable for us to operate our ethanol plant. Further, new products or methods of ethanol production developed by larger and better-financed competitors could provide them competitive advantages over us and harm our business.
     Local Competition
     A majority of the U.S. ethanol plants, and therefore, the greatest number of gallons of ethanol production capacity, are concentrated in the corn-producing states of Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, South Dakota, Ohio, Wisconsin, Kansas, and North Dakota.  According to the RFA, as of November 15, 2018, Minnesota is one of the top producers of ethanol in the U.S. with 22 ethanol plants producing an aggregate of approximately 1.3 billion gallons of ethanol per year. Therefore, we face increased regional and local competition because of the location of our ethanol plant.  
    
 
  12

 

 Eco-Energy markets out ethanol primarily on a regional and national basis.  We compete with other ethanol producers both for markets in Minnesota and markets in other states. We believe that we are able to reach the best available markets through the use of our experienced marketer and by the rail delivery methods we use. We believe that we can compete favorably with other ethanol producers due to our proximity to ample grain, natural gas, electricity and water supplies at favorable prices.
     International Competition
     In addition to intense competition with domestic producers of ethanol, we have faced increased competition from ethanol produced in foreign countries. Depending on feedstock prices, ethanol imported from foreign countries may be less expensive than domestically-produced ethanol.  However, foreign demand, transportation costs and infrastructure constraints may temper the market impact on the U.S. Ethanol imports have been lower in recent years and ethanol exports have been higher. However, if demand for imported ethanol were to increase again, demand for domestic ethanol may be reduced, which could lead to lower domestic prices and lower operating margins. Large international companies with much greater resources than ours have developed, or are developing, increased foreign ethanol production capacities. Many international suppliers produce ethanol primarily from inputs other than corn, such as sugar cane, and have cost structures that may be substantially lower than U.S. based ethanol producers including us. Many of these international suppliers are companies with much greater resources than us with greater production capacities.Alternative Fuels and Other Fuel Additives Competition
     Alternative fuels and alternative ethanol production methods are continually under development. New ethanol products or methods of ethanol production developed by larger and better-financed competitors could provide them competitive advantages over us and harm our business.
     We anticipate increased competition from renewable fuels that do not use corn as the feedstock. Many of the current ethanol production incentives are designed to encourage the production of renewable fuels using raw materials other than corn. One type of ethanol production feedstock that is being explored is cellulose. Cellulose is found in wood chips, corn stalks and rice straw, amongst other common plants. Several companies and researchers have commenced pilot projects to study the feasibility of commercially producing cellulosic ethanol. 
     A few companies have completed commercial scale cellulosic ethanol plants. If this technology can be profitably employed on a commercial scale, it could potentially lead to ethanol that is less expensive to produce than corn based ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol may also capture more government subsidies and assistance than corn based ethanol. This could decrease demand for our product or result in competitive disadvantages for our ethanol production process.
     In addition to competing with ethanol producers, we also compete with producers of other gasoline oxygenates.  Many gasoline oxygenates are produced by other companies, including oil companies.  The major oil companies have significantly greater resources than we have to develop alternative products and to influence legislation and public perception of ethanol. Historically, as a gasoline oxygenate, ethanol primarily competed with two gasoline oxygenates, both of which are ether-based: MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) and ETBE (ethyl tertiary butyl ether).  While ethanol has displaced these two gasoline oxygenates, the development of ethers intended for use as oxygenates is continuing and we will compete with producers of any future ethers used as oxygenates.
     A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative fuels and clean power systems using fuel cells, plug-in hybrids, electric cars or clean burning gaseous fuels. Electric car technology has recently grown in popularity, especially in urban areas. While there are currently a limited number of vehicle recharging stations, there has been increased focus on developing these recharging stations to make electric car technology more feasible and widely available in the future. Additional competition from these other sources of alternative energy, particularly in the automobile market, could reduce the demand for ethanol, which would negatively impact our profitability.

 Distillers’ Grains Competition
     The amount of distillers’ grains produced annually in North America has increased significantly as the number of ethanol plants increased.  We compete with other producers of distillers’ grains products both locally and nationally, with more intense competition for sales of distillers’ grains among ethanol producers in close proximity to our ethanol plant.  These competitors may be more likely to sell to the same markets that we target for our distillers’ grains.
     Distillers’ grains are primarily used as an animal feed, competing with other feed formulations using corn and soybean meal. As a result, we believe that distillers’ grains prices are positively impacted by increases in corn and soybean prices. In recent years the U.S. ethanol industry has increased exports of distillers’ grains which management believes has positively impacted demand and prices for distillers’ grains in the U.S. However, with the recent imposition of Chinese import duties on U.S. distillers’ grains, distillers’ grains exports have been negatively impacted, increasing the domestic supply of distillers’ grains. Increased domestic supply has had a corresponding negative impact on distillers’ grains prices and has decreased the price of distillers’ grains as compared to a comparable volume of corn. In the event these distillers’ grains exports continue to decrease, it could result in increased competition among ethanol producers for sales of distillers’ grains and could negatively impact distillers’ grains prices in the U.S.
     Corn Oil Competition
     We compete with many ethanol producers for the sale of corn oil. Many ethanol producers have installed the equipment necessary to separate corn oil from the distillers’ grains they produce which has increased competition for corn oil sales and has resulted in lower market corn oil prices.     Government Ethanol Supports
     The ethanol industry is dependent on several economic incentives to produce ethanol, the most significant of which is the federal Renewable Fuels Standard (the “RFS”). The RFS is a national program that does not require that any renewable fuels be used in any particular area or state, allowing refiners to use renewable fuel blends in those areas where it is most cost-effective. The RFS has been, and we expect will continue to be, a significant factor impacting ethanol usage. 
     Under the RFS, the EPA is supposed to pass an annual rule that establishes the number of gallons of different types of renewable fuels that must be used in the U.S. by refineries, blenders, distributors and importers which is called the renewable volume obligations (“RVOs”). The EPA has the authority to waive the mandates in whole or in part if one of two conditions is met: 1) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply, or 2) implementation of the mandate requirement severely harms the economy or environment of a state, region or the U.S.
     The RFS sets the statutory RVO for corn-based ethanol at 15 billion gallons beginning in 2016 and each year thereafter through 2022. On November 30, 2018, the EPA announced the final rule for 2018 RVOs, which was set at 15.0 billion gallons for corn-based ethanol.  This rule is set at 100% of the original conventional biofuel requirement of 15.0 billion gallons, and is considered a favorable outcome by the industry. The 2018 final rule also set advanced biofuels at 4.29 billion gallons, for overall RVOs of 19.29 billion gallons for 2018.
    
 On November 30, 2018, the EPA announced the final 2019 RVOs, setting the RVOs for conventional ethanol at 15.0 billion gallons, advanced biofuels at 4.92 billion gallons and cellulosic ethanol at 0.42 billion gallons, for overall RVOs of 19.92 billion gallons for 2019.  Although this final rule achieves the statutory RVO for conventional corn-based ethanol originally set by Congress when the RFS was enacted, it reduces the overall RVOs below the overall statutory level of 26 billion gallons.

     Current ethanol production capacity exceeds the EPA’s 2018 and 2019 RVOs that can be satisfied by corn-based ethanol.  According to the RFS, if mandatory renewable fuel volumes are reduced by at least 20% for two consecutive years, the EPA is required to modify, or reset, statutory volumes through 2022. In October 2018, the Office of Management and Budget announced that the 20% thresholds “have been met or are expected to be met in the near future.” As a result, the EPA is proposing a rulemaking that will propose modifying the applicable volumes targets for cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuels for the years 2020-2022. Additionally, the EPA will be proposing volume requirements for biomass-based diesel for 2021 and 2022. Because the timetable for the rulemaking overlaps with the annual standard-setting rulemakings, the rulemaking will also include the applicable percentage standards for 2020. If the statutory RVOs are reduced as a result of reset, it could have an adverse effect on the market price and demand for ethanol which would negatively impact our financial performance.
     Beginning in January 2016, various ethanol and agricultural industry groups petitioned a federal appeals court to hear a legal challenge to of the EPA’s decision to reduce the total renewable fuel volume requirements for 2014-2016 through use of its “inadequate domestic supply” waiver authority. On July 28, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of the petitioners, concluding that the EPA erred in its exercise of “inadequate domestic supply” waiver authority by considering demand-side constraints. As a result, the Court vacated the EPA’s decision to reduce the total renewable fuel volume requirements for 2016, and remanded to the EPA to address the 2016 total renewable fuels volume requirements. While management believes the decision should benefit the ethanol industry overall by clarifying the EPA's waiver analysis is limited to consideration of supply-side factors only, no direct impact on the Company is expected from the decision.
     Management anticipates that there will be further legal challenges to the EPA's reduction in the volume requirements, including the final rules for 2017, 2018, and 2019. However, if the EPA's decision to reduce the volume requirements under the RFS is allowed to stand, or if the volume requirements are further reduced, it could have an adverse effect on the market price and demand for ethanol which would negatively impact our financial performance.
     Beyond the federal mandates, there are limited domestic markets for ethanol.  Further, opponents of ethanol such as large oil companies will likely continue their efforts to repeal or reduce the RFS through lawsuits or lobbying of Congress.  If such efforts are successful in further reducing or repealing the blending requirements of the RFS, a significant decrease in ethanol demand may result and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, unless additional demand from exports or discretionary or E85 blending develops.
     Most ethanol that is used in the U.S. is sold in a blend called E10. E10 is a blend of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline. E10 is approved for use in all standard vehicles. Estimates indicate that gasoline demand in the U.S. is approximately 140 billion gallons per year. Assuming that all gasoline in the U.S. is blended at a rate of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline, the maximum demand for ethanol is 14.0 billion gallons per year.  This is commonly referred to as the “blend wall,” which represents a theoretical limit where more ethanol cannot be blended into the national gasoline pool. This is a theoretical limit because it is believed that it would not be possible to blend ethanol into every gallon of gasoline that is being used in 

 
  15

 
the U.S. and it discounts the possibility of additional ethanol used in higher percentage blends such as E15 and E85. These higher percentage blends may lead to additional ethanol demand if they become more widely available and accepted by the market.
     There is growing availability of E85 for use in flexible fuel vehicles, however it is limited due to lacking infrastructure. In addition, the industry has been working to introduce E15 to the retail market since the EPA approved its use vehicles model year 2001 and newer. However, wide spread adoption of E15 is hampered by regulatory and infrastructure hurdles in many states, as well as consumer acceptance. Additionally, sales of E15 may be limited because: (i) it is not approved for use in all vehicles; (ii) the EPA requires a label that management believes may discourage consumers from using E15; and (iii) retailers may choose not to sell E15 due to concerns regarding liability. In addition, different gasoline blendstocks may be required at certain times of the year in order to use E15 due to federal regulations related to fuel evaporative emissions. This may prevent E15 from being used during certain times of the year in various states. However, in October 2018, President Trump directed the EPA to promulgate a regulation making E15 available year-round. The Office of Management and Budget expects that the EPA will release a proposed rule in February 2019, with the final rule scheduled to be issued in May 2019. Notably, much of the EPA’s staff was subject to furlough due to a partial government shutdown in January 2019. It is also important to note that the oil industry is expected to challenge this rulemaking. As a result, there is no guarantee that the year-round E15 rule will be finalized pursuant to the proposed timeline, nor is there a guarantee that the rule will ever be finalized.
     Obligated parties use renewable identification numbers (“RINs”) to show compliance with RFS-mandated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by producers and detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detached RINs affects the price of ethanol in certain markets and influences the purchasing decisions by obligated parties. Under the RFS, small refineries may petition for and be granted temporary exemptions from the RVOs if they can demonstrate that compliance with the RVOs would cause disproportionate economic hardship. Waivers granted in 2016 and 2017 effectively lowered the RVOs by at least 1.6 billion gallons, according to the Renewable Fuels Association. On December 20, 2018, the EPA released data on the number of waivers filed, which indicated that, as of December 18, 2018, 22 petitions for waivers for the 2018 compliance year have been received. For the 2017 compliance year, 37 petitions have been received. To date, the EPA has approved 29 of those petitions, with 7 currently pending and 1 declared ineligible or withdrawn. The 29 approved petitions have exempted approximately 1.46 billion RINs, which is approximately 13.62 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel, from meeting the RFS blending targets. It is expected that additional petitions for waivers for the 2018 compliance year will be received by the EPA. It is also expected that the EPA will approve a significant number of these waiver petitions, thereby exempting a substantial number of gallons of gasoline and diesel from meeting the RFS blending targets. These exemptions decrease demand for our products, which negatively impacts ethanol prices and our profitability.
     Compliance with Environmental Laws and Other Regulatory Matters
     Our business subjects us to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including: those relating to discharges into the air, water, and ground; the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation, and disposal of hazardous materials; and the health and safety of our employees. These laws and regulations require us to obtain and comply with numerous permits to construct and operate our ethanol plants, including water, air, and other environmental permits.  The costs associated with obtaining these permits and meeting the conditions of these permits have increased our costs of construction and production.  
     Additionally, compliance with environmental laws and permit conditions in the future could require expensive pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment, as well as significant management time and expense.  A violation of these laws, regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial fines, natural resource damage, criminal sanctions, permit revocations, and/or plant shutdown, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Although violations and environmental non-compliance still remain a possibility following our conversion from coal to natural gas combustion, the exposure to the company has been greatly reduced.
     Our plants’ air permits require certain on-going performance testing to be completed periodically to ensure compliance with minor source emission limits. On May 12, 2017, HLBE submitted a letter to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (“MPCA”) regarding the certain non-compliant results from on-going performance testing required under its air permit. Since reporting to MPCA, The Company cooperated with MPCA’s review of the non-compliant tests and maintained open communication with MPCA staff to resolve the matter. On October 17, 2017, HLBE entered into a 

 
  16

 
stipulation agreement with MPCA relating to the non-compliant test results.  Under the stipulation agreement, HLBE agreed to pay a civil penalty of $63,500, which was paid in October 2017.
     In the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, GFE and HLBE incurred costs and expenses of approximately $102,000 and $133,000 respectively, complying with environmental laws, including HLBE’s civil penalty for non-compliance.  Although we have been successful in obtaining all of the permits currently required to operate our plants, any retroactive change in environmental regulations, either at the federal or state level, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources in complying with such regulations.
     On January 13, 2015 and March 30, 2015, HLBE and GFE, respectively, submitted efficient producer petitions to the EPA.  The EPA awarded efficient producer pathway approval to HLBE and GFE on March 12, 2015 and May 13, 2015, respectively.  In the approval determinations, the EPA’s analysis indicated that HLBE achieved at least a 20.1% reduction and GFE achieved a 26.0% reduction in greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions for their non-grandfathered volumes compared to the baseline lifecycle GHG emissions.
     Pursuant to the award approval, HLBE and GFE are only authorized to generate RINs for each plant’s non-grandfathered volumes if each plant can demonstrate that all ethanol produced at the plant during an averaging period (defined as the prior 365 days or the number of days since the date EPA efficient producer pathway approval) meets the 20% GHG reduction requirement. To make these demonstrations, HLBE and GFE must develop compliance plans and keep certain records as specified in the approvals. Additionally, the EPA approvals require that HLBE and GFE register with the EPA as a renewable fuel producer for the non-grandfathered volumes. Although we believe GFE and HLBE will be able to maintain continuous compliance with the 20% reduction in GHG emissions requirement, there is no guarantee that we will do so.  If GFE or HLBE do not maintain continuous compliance with the 20% reduction in GHG emissions requirement, we will not be able issue RINs for the non-grandfathered volumes of ethanol produced at the plants.  As a result, we may be forced to rely on exports sales for these non-grandfathered volumes ethanol, which could adversely affect our operating margins, which, in turn could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
     The California Air Resources Board, or CARB, has adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard, or LCFS, requiring a 10% reduction in average carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel transportation fuels from 2010 to 2020. After a series of rulings that temporarily prevented CARB from enforcing these regulations, the federal appellate court reversed the federal district court finding the LCFS constitutional and remanding the case back to federal district court to determine whether the LCFS imposes a burden on interstate commerce that is excessive in light of the local benefits. On June 30, 2014, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal of the federal appellate court ruling and CARB recently re-adopted the LCFS with some slight modifications. The LCFS could have a negative impact on demand for corn-based ethanol and result in decreased ethanol prices affecting our ability to operate profitably.        In February 2013, an anti-dumping tariff was imposed as a regulation by the Council of the European Union ethanol produced in the United States and exported to Europe. The Company does not export any ethanol to Europe at this time. However, continuation of this duty or imposition of tariffs by other countries or regions could reduce United States exports to Europe, and possibly other export markets. A reduction of exports to Europe could have an adverse effect on domestic ethanol prices, as the available supply of ethanol for the domestic market would increase.
     Employees
     We compete with ethanol producers in close proximity for the personnel we will require to operate our plants.  The existence and development of other ethanol plants will increase competition for qualified managers, engineers, operators and other personnel.  We also compete for personnel with businesses other than ethanol producers and with businesses located within the Granite Falls and Heron Lake, Minnesota communities.
     As of the date of this report, we have 82 full time employees at our two consolidated ethanol plants, of which 42 are employed at the GFE plant and 40 are employed at the HLBE plant.  Of our total employees, 17 are involved primarily in management and administration with 10 employees at the GFE plant and 7 at the HLBE plant. The remaining employees are involved primarily in plant operations.  We do not currently anticipate any significant change in the number of employees at our plants.

 On July 31, 2013, GFE entered into a management services agreement with HLBE.  Pursuant to the management services agreement, GFE provides its chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and commodity risk manager to act in those positions as part-time officers and managers of HLBE. Each person providing management services to HLBE under the management services agreement is subject to oversight by the HLBE board of governors.  However, GFE’s chief executive officer is solely responsible for hiring and firing persons providing management services under the management services agreement.
     The term of the management services agreement automatically renews for successive one-year terms until either party gives the other party written notice of termination prior to expiration of the then current term. The management services agreement may also be terminated by either party for cause under certain circumstances.
     GFE is responsible for and agreed to directly pay salary, wages, and/or benefits to the persons providing management services under the management services agreement.  Under the terms of the management services agreement, HLBE pays GFE 50% of the total salary, bonuses and other expenses and costs (including all benefits and tax contributions) incurred by GFE for the three management positions, paid on an estimated monthly basis with a “true-up” following the close of our fiscal year.
     Financial Information about Geographic Areas
     All of our operations are domiciled in the U.S. All of the products sold to our customers for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016 were produced in the U.S. and all of our long-lived assets are domiciled in the U.S. We have engaged third-party professional marketers who decide where our products are marketed and we have no control over the marketing decisions made by our third-party professional marketers. These third-party marketers may decide to sell our products in countries other than the U.S. However, we anticipate that our products will primarily be sold in the U.S.      Investments
    
On November 1, 2016, we subscribed to purchase 1,500 capital units of Ring-neck Energy & Feed, LLC (“Ringneck”) at a price of $5,000 per unit for a total of $7,500,000.  We paid a down payment of $750,000 in connection with our subscription, and signed a promissory note for $6,750,000 for the remaining balance of the subscription. By letter dated July 12, 2017, GFE was notified of Ringneck’s acceptance of GFE’s subscription and that payment of the balance of GFE’s subscription due under the promissory note was due no later than August 2, 2017. On August 2, 2017, GFE borrowed $7.5 million under its credit facility with Project Hawkeye, LLC (“Project Hawkeye”), an affiliate of Fagen, Inc., which is a member of GFE, and paid the remaining balance due on GFE’s subscription of $6,750,000 to Ringneck. Details of the Project Hawkeye credit facility are provided below in the section below entitled “PART II - ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Credit Arrangements”.
     Ringneck is a South Dakota limited liability company that intends to build an 80 million gallon per year ethanol manufacturing plant in outside of Onida, South Dakota in Sully County. GFE’s investment is sufficient to grant it the right to appoint one director to the board of directors of Ringneck and GFE has appointed Steve Christensen, its CEO, to serve as its appointed director. The units we acquired in Ringneck are subject to restrictions on transfer; therefore, this should not be considered a liquid investment.  It may take a significant amount of time before we realize a return on our investment, if we realize a return on the investment at all.
     Ringneck offered its units pursuant to a private placement memorandum. Additionally, because Ringneck is not conducting a federally-registered offering, we do not expect that information about Ringneck will be available via the SEC’s EDGAR filing system. Therefore, it may be difficult for our investors to obtain information about Ringneck.
     In connection with our subscription, GFE entered into a credit facility with Project Hawkeye pursuant to which GFE borrowed $7.5 million to finance the investment in Ringneck.
