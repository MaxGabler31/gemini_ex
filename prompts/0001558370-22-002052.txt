Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical-stage company developing transformational treatments for patients with serious metabolic diseases marked by high unmet medical need, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, a disease without any approved therapies. NASH is a severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, characterized by inflammation and fibrosis in the liver that can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, cancer and death. Our lead product candidate, efruxifermin, or EFX, is an analog of fibroblast growth factor 21, or FGF21, which is an endogenously expressed hormone that protects against cellular stress and regulates metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins throughout the body. EFX is currently being evaluated in two Phase 2b clinical trials in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH: the HARMONY study in pre-cirrhotic patients with F2-F3 fibrosis and the SYMMETRY study in cirrhotic patients with compensated F4 fibrosis. We expect to report results from the HARMONY study in the third quarter of this year. Based on clinical data to date, which include evidence of substantial rates of fibrosis regression among biopsy-confirmed patients treated with EFX for only 16 weeks, we believe EFX has the potential, if approved, to be a best-in-class FGF21 analog for treating NASH.
The rapidly rising prevalence of NAFLD and NASH is driven by the global obesity epidemic and the resulting accumulation of excessive liver fat. In patients with NASH, excessive liver fat leads to hepatocyte stress, which triggers localized inflammation and, as disease progresses, can lead to fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis. According to a study published in Hepatology (2018), the prevalence of NASH in the United States is projected to increase to 27.0 million by 2030, including a doubling in prevalence among patients with advanced fibrosis. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in patients with NASH. About half of all patients with NASH also have Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, or T2D. We believe an optimal NASH therapy should reduce risks of cardiovascular disease, improve glycemic control, and reverse fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are currently no approved therapies for NASH and many late-stage therapeutic candidates have shown limited efficacy and/or unwanted side effects that have the potential to increase certain mortality risks for patients with NASH.
The Phase 2b HARMONY and SYMMETRY studies build on the results of three prior randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, in which a total of 162 adult patients with either NASH (n=79) or T2D (n=83) were treated with EFX for up to 16 weeks. Our Phase 2a BALANCED study showed EFX’s potential to reverse fibrosis and restore metabolic health while maintaining a favorable cardiovascular profile. Among 40 EFX-treated patients with F1-F3 fibrosis who had end-of-treatment biopsies, 48% achieved at least a one-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH and 48% achieved NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis. Improvements in metabolic health included significant relative reductions in liver fat (up to 71%), significant reductions in HbA1c (up to 0.9% in patients with NASH and T2D) and significant reductions in triglycerides (up to 45%), a key attribute as cardiovascular disease remains the number one cause of mortality in patients with NASH. Across EFX groups, the most frequent adverse events were grade 1 or 2 gastrointestinal events, which were transient in nature. 
Results among a subset of patients from the 16-week BALANCED main study who had F2 or F3 fibrosis at baseline as well as results from an expansion cohort of patients with cirrhotic NASH (F4, compensated) support our confidence that histological improvements will be observed in the ongoing HARMONY and SYMMETRY studies, where patients are being treated for longer periods of 24 and 36 weeks, respectively. Among BALANCED study patients who had F2-F3 fibrosis at baseline, 68% had at least a one-stage improvement in fibrosis and 50% had a two-stage fibrosis improvement. We also observed that 33% of patients with cirrhosis (F4, compensated) achieved a one-stage improvement fibrosis without worsening of NASH after just 16 weeks. 
The FDA and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, have respectively granted a Fast Track designation and a Priority Medicines, or PRIME, designation for EFX for the treatment of NASH. The Fast Track and PRIME programs are designed to enhance regulatory support for the development of promising investigational medicines where early clinical data suggest the potential to meet a high unmet medical need. Benefits of these programs may include more 

6



frequent regulatory interactions, enhanced guidance on the overall development plan and regulatory strategy, and accelerated assessment of marketing authorization applications.
As demonstrated across three separate clinical trials in patients with NASH and/or T2D, EFX has a unique ability to reproduce the actions of native FGF21. Consequently, we believe EFX holds the potential to be a highly-differentiated, best-in-class FGF21 analog and promising monotherapy for the treatment of NASH, if approved. NASH is a complex disease, and its ideal treatment would include intervening at each stage of its pathogenesis. We believe EFX could potentially address all stages of NASH pathogenesis in a single treatment: reversing fibrosis, resolving steatohepatitis, and helping to restore healthy metabolism to the whole body. We also believe EFX may be able to be used in combination with other therapies for potentially greater effect in certain subpopulations.

In June 2018, we acquired exclusive global development and commercialization rights to EFX from Amgen Inc., or Amgen, which leveraged its deep protein engineering expertise to design and develop EFX. As of February 7, 2022, our patent portfolio relating to EFX and other peptides included 154 issued patents and 22 pending patents worldwide, with expected patent exclusivity up to 2034 in the United States, including potential patent term extension. Since EFX is a biologic, marketing approval would also provide twelve years of market exclusivity from the approval date of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, in the United States.
Our management team has extensive experience in drug discovery, development and commercialization, and has been involved in the approvals of more than 20 medicines. Our Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Cheng, MD, PhD, was formerly Chief Medical Officer at Gilead, and responsible for clinical development for Gilead's HIV program. Our Chief Development Officer, Kitty Yale, led global clinical operations and management of Gilead’s oncology, HIV, inflammation and liver disease trials. Our Chief Scientific Officer, Tim Rolph, DPhil, was formerly Chief Scientific Officer of Pfizer's Cardiovascular & Metabolic Disease Research Unit, and oversaw Pfizer's FGF21 program. We believe that our team is well positioned to leverage its collective experience in drug development and in-depth knowledge of FGF21 biology and metabolic diseases to develop and commercialize products that will have significant benefits for patients with NASH and other serious metabolic diseases with high unmet medical need.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing transformative treatments for serious metabolic diseases with high unmet medical need, with an initial focus on NASH. The key components of our strategy are to:
Advance EFX through clinical development in both pre-cirrhotic (F2/F3) and cirrhotic (F4, compensated) NASH. We believe that EFX has the potential to be a best-in-class FGF21 analog, if approved, for the treatment of NASH. Data from our Phase 2a BALANCED study suggest that EFX has the potential to achieve industry-leading levels of fibrosis improvement as well as resolution of steatohepatitis and improvements in glycemic control and lipoprotein profile. We are committed to accelerating development as much as possible for patients with either pre-cirrhotic or cirrhotic NASH, consistent with guidance from regulatory authorities.
Scale our capabilities to support development and commercialization of EFX. We are scaling our manufacturing and organizational capabilities to capitalize on our exclusive, global rights to market EFX. We have successfully manufactured drug substance at Boehringer Ingelheim and are scaling up manufacturing of a new drug product/device combination at Vetter Pharma to supply our Phase 3 program. When appropriate, we intend to develop the commercial infrastructure required for bringing EFX to patients with NASH in the United States, if approved. We also plan to evaluate options, including potential strategic collaborations, for delivering EFX, if approved, to patients in other key markets, such as Europe, Japan and China.
Leverage our knowledge of FGF21 biology to bring EFX to additional patients with metabolic diseases. Numerous publications have shown that increases in endogenous FGF21 expression occur in response to various types of metabolic and cellular stress arising from obesity, diabetes, mitochondrial diseases and cardiovascular disease, as well as NASH. EFX has been engineered to reproduce the biological activity profile of native FGF21 while also addressing certain therapeutic limitations, such as a short half-life. We are exploring opportunities to develop EFX for additional 

7



indications where there is a compelling scientific rationale, strong clinical tractability and significant unmet medical need.
Enhance our position as a leading metabolic disease company by developing, acquiring or in-licensing additional investigational product candidates. We are continually evaluating opportunities to build a robust pipeline of potential leading treatments for serious metabolic diseases. We may select additional assets for their potential as stand-alone monotherapies or for eventual use in combination with other products.
Our Pipeline
Our pipeline is anchored by EFX, a potential best-in-class FGF21 analog for treatment of NASH, if approved. We have one EFX program focused on patients with pre-cirrhotic NASH (F2-F3), which is supported by the HARMONY study, an ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial. We have a second EFX program focused on patients with cirrhotic NASH (F4, compensated), which is supported by the SYMMETRY study, an ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial. These two programs align with FDA guidance published in 2018 and 2019, which recommends different regulatory approval pathways for patients with pre-cirrhotic and cirrhotic NASH.

NASH Overview
NASH is a severe form of NAFLD, which is driven by the global obesity epidemic. Patients with NAFLD have an excessive accumulation of fat in the liver resulting from an excess of caloric intake over energy needs. In patients with NASH, excessive liver fat leads to hepatocyte stress, which triggers localized inflammation and can cause extensive scarring, or fibrosis, of the liver, as the liver attemps to repair and replace damaged cells.
Patients with NASH are at increased risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality, including liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. As NASH progresses, cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality also increase, with cardiovascular disease being the most frequent cause of death in patients with NASH. The prevalence of patients with advanced fibrosis (F2-F4) in the United States is projected to rise 14.1 million by 2030, representing a roughly 100% increase from an estimated 6.7 million in 2016. 
Diagnosis and disease burden
NASH is currently diagnosed through liver biopsy and its severity is measured using scoring systems that assess the extent and severity of steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning and fibrosis. Some patients may be diagnosed with NASH after presenting with symptoms such as general fatigue and nondescript abdominal 

8



discomfort. However, NASH diagnosis more commonly follows detection of elevated liver enzymes on routine lab tests or detection of an enlarged steatotic liver by abdominal imaging. Although noninvasive methods, including a combination of imaging, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging Protein Density Fat Fraction, or, MRI-PDFF, and fibroscan, and plasma biomarkers of fibrosis, such as Pro-C3, are being evaluated as potential diagnostic tools, none have yet been validated for use in formal NASH diagnosis.
Two different scoring systems are most commonly used in the United States to measure the severity of NASH: the NAFLD activity score, or NAS, and fibrosis stage. The NAS, which was developed for, and generally only used in, clinical trials, is a measure of liver histology that grades disease activity in patients with NAFLD and NASH. A patient may receive a composite NAS score of 0-8, which is comprised of three individual scores: (1) steatosis, scored 0-3 according to the percentage of a microscopic field showing steatosis, (2) lobular inflammation, scored 0-3 according to the number of immune cell foci per 20x optical field in a microscope, and (3) hepatocellular ballooning, scored 0-2 according to the number of ballooning cells in a microscopic field. In addition, fibrosis staging is used to classify the extent and severity of fibrosis with a scoring system based on a scale from 0-4, or F0-F4. Early, discrete fibrosis is classified as F1 or F2, whereas bridging fibrosis is classified as F3. As more hepatocytes die and scarring becomes extensive, the liver becomes cirrhotic, which is classified as stage F4.
Patients with NASH are at increased risk of liver damage and other complications. Fibrosis is generally reversible in its early-to-mid stages. However, late-stage fibrosis can be irreversible in the absence of therapy and prevents the liver from performing its natural functions.
NASH is commonly associated with metabolic comorbidities, including obesity, T2D, dyslipidemia and hypertension. In addition, the majority of patients with NASH also present with metabolic syndrome. As shown in the figure below, which is based on a pooled meta-analysis of multinational clinical trial data published in Hepatology (2017), liver-related mortality increases with fibrosis stage. As compared to healthy individuals, patients with NASH also experience higher all-cause morbidity and mortality resulting from major adverse cardiovascular events, and non-liver cancers. The most common cause of death in patients with NASH is cardiovascular disease. As with liver-related mortality, all-cause mortality also increases with fibrosis stage. Our focus is on patients with F2-F4 fibrosis, which have the highest liver-related and non-liver-related mortality rates among patients with NASH.

Market size and trends
According to studies published in Hepatology (2018) and F1000Research (2018), more than one billion people worldwide were estimated to have NAFLD in 2016, including an estimated 85 million individuals in the United States. Approximately 10-20% of patients with NAFLD progress to NASH, including an estimated 17.3 million individuals in the United States and 16.4 million aggregate individuals in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Japan in 2016. As the population ages, the prevalence of NASH is projected to increase approximately 50% by 2030 to a total of 27.0 million individuals in the United States and 22.5 million aggregate individuals in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and Japan. However, NASH afflicts all age groups, including teenagers and young adults, for whom the loss of quality-adjusted life years will be substantial unless progression to late-stage diseases can be halted or reversed. According to a study published in Hepatology (2016), in the absence of approved therapies, direct healthcare costs associated with NAFLD and NASH in the United States were estimated to be approximately $100 billion in 2016.
Growth in prevalence of NASH in the United States is projected to be greatest in patients with stage F2-F4 fibrosis, with more than a doubling across these stages between 2016 and 2030 and higher growth rates with each advancing fibrosis stage. More than 14 million Americans are projected to have NASH with F2, F3 or F4 fibrosis in the United States by 2030, with over ten million aggregate individuals in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Japan. This rapid growth in advanced fibrosis reflects the impact of the late 20th century obesity epidemic, leading patients over time to progress through NAFLD to advanced NASH. 
Emerging therapies in development
There are no therapies currently approved for the treatment of NASH. The current standard of care is diet and exercise. Although diet and exercise are effective for some patients in the treatment of NASH when maintained, adherence to this treatment regimen is generally poor. In addition, according to studies in Gastroenterology (2016) and the New England Journal of Medicine (2021), a substantial portion of patients who achieve siginfcant weight loss do not experience fibroris regression and, among those who do reverse fibrosis, it typically takes 4-5 years.
The multistep progression of NASH pathogenesis offers a variety of potential approaches for therapeutic intervention and many of these approaches have been explored with one or more therapeutic candidates. During the last few years, many NASH therapeutic candidates have had discouraging clinical trial results due to unfavorable efficacy and/or safety results; a substantial number of programs have been discontinued. Disappointing clinical results have especially been associated with therapeutic candidates designed to target late-stage disease by mitigating inflammation and reversing fibrosis, which have been labeled as “anti-fibrotic” mechanisms. Available data suggest that focusing only on suppressing inflammation and fibrosis is unlikely to deliver sustained reversal of fibrosis or resolution of NASH because the processes underlying NASH pathogenesis are not being addressed.
Clinical data has been more promising for “metabolic” therapeutic mechanisms that target earlier-stages of NASH pathogenesis, including excessive liver fat accumulation. Recent data for metabolic therapeutic candidates are consistent with data from anti-viral treatment of hepatitis C and modification of diet and exercise as a treatment for NASH. In each of these two cases, targeting the processes underlying inflammation and fibrosis of the liver can lead to reversal of fibrosis, even without a directly anti-fibrotic intervention. However, some of the encouraging data for metabolic therapeutic mechanisms has been offset by unwanted side effects, which may limit their ability to be used as treatment for patients with NASH. For instance, some NASH candidates have been shown to substantially increase plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-C, or triglycerides, each of which is an independent causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Patients with NASH are already at increased risk for cardiovascular events. We therefore believe interventions that could be associated with increased cardiovascular risk may struggle to gain marketing approval from regulatory authorities and, if approved, may not be prescribed widely by treating physicians. 
We believe the greatest potential for effective NASH treatment requires addressing both the late-stage fibrosis and the underlying processes of NASH pathogenesis with a favorable cardiovascular profile and without increasing the potential for drug-drug interactions associated with small molecules. Some NASH candidates are being evaluated for use in combination with one or more other investigational or marketed drugs to intervene at different stages of NASH 

10



pathogenesis and manage unwanted side effects. However, combining multiple interventions, particularly multiple small molecules, places an additional burden of drug metabolism and clearance upon already stressed hepatocytes.
We believe EFX has unique properties with the potential to address the complex pathogenesis of NASH as a foundational monotherapy: reducing liver fat, restoring metabolic balance, and reversing fibrosis while simultaneously improving independent risks of cardiovascular disease, without worsening any aspect of NASH pathogenesis.
Harnessing FGF21’s Natural Metabolic and Anti-Fibrotic Effects
EFX harnesses the natural properties of FGF21 as a potential treatment for NASH. Specifically, EFX has been engineered to overcome the limitations of endogenous FGF21 by extending half-life from less than two hours to 3-4 days while maintaining FGF21’s natural role in alleviating cellular stress and regulating whole-body metabolism. Consequently, EFX has the potential to address the underlying metabolic disease drivers of NASH while also reversing liver fibrosis. We believe EFX has the potential to be the leading FGF21 analog that most closely mimics the native protein with a long half-life that supports convenient weekly dosing. 
Overview of FGF21 biology
Fibroblast growth factors, or FGFs, are a large family of cell-signaling proteins involved in the regulation of many processes within the body. FGF21 is part of a sub-family of FGFs, known as endocrine FGFs, which are unique among FGFs because they initiate their biological effects by binding tightly to a cell surface receptor known as Beta Klotho, or bKlotho. After this initial binding, FGF21 triggers signaling pathways within cells, such as hepatocytes and adipocytes, by binding to a second class of cell-surface receptor, known as the FGF receptors, or FGFRs. FGF21 binds to three specific FGFRs, known as FGFR1c, FGFR2c and FGFR3c. Once a co-receptor complex has formed with bKlotho and one of the FGFRs, a series of intracellular signaling cascades is initiated. These signaling cascades enable FGF21 to exert its biological functions, which include regulation of energy homeostasis, glucose-lipid-protein metabolism and insulin sensitivity, and modulation of pathways that mitigate against intracellular stress. FGF21 cannot signal through cell membranes without both an intact C-terminus and an intact N-terminus to bind, respectively, to bKlotho and FGFR. We believe EFX has been engineered to maximize binding at both the C-terminus and N-terminus, which distinguishes EFX from other FGF21 analogs.
EFX is designed to overcome the limitations of native FGF21 as a therapeutic 
EFX has been engineered to overcome the limitations of native FGF21 while retaining balanced agonism across FGFR1c, FGFR2c and FGFR3c. Specifically, EFX delivers: (1) protection against proteolysis and reduction of renal clearance, (2) an increased half-life from less than two hours to 3-4 days, (3) minimization of the potential for aggregation in solution and (4) improved binding affinity for bKlotho. These attributes are accomplished through a combination of three amino acid substitutions in the FGF21 protein sequence and an Fc-fusion protein scaffold similar to the platform used for Enbrel and Trulicity. As illustrated in the figure below, each EFX molecule consists of two Fc-FGF21 molecules linked by two disulfide bridges. The N-terminus of the FGF21 moiety is connected to the Fc portion of EFX through a polyglycine-serine linker. Our patents include claims directed to Fc fusion with a recombinantly modified FGF21 as well as claims directed to an FGF21 polypeptide comprising combinations of point mutations at positions 98, 171 and 180 of mature human FGF21.

11



Protein engineering of EFX
EFX maintains balanced agonism of FGFR1c, FGFR2c and FGFR3c to mimic native FGF21
​
EFX was designed through an empirical discovery process that incorporated in vitro and in vivo measurements of receptor agonism to assess which of many tested discovery candidates yielded the most attractive drug properties. EFX was selected for clinical evaluation over other discovery candidates, which included a proprietary PEGylated FGF21 analog and two versions of a two-point mutation Fc-fusion protein known as RG (with mutations at positions 98 and 171, but not 180), one of which had the Fc fused to the C-terminus while the other had it fused to the N-terminus of the modified FGF21. In comparative in vitro receptor agonism assays, EFX exhibited the greatest potency for each of FGFR1c, FGFR2c, and FGFR3c among the candidates tested. Furthermore, the potency of EFX for FGFR1c, FGFR2c and FGFR3c was comparable to that of recombinantly-expressed human FGF21. 
In vitro receptor agonism assays do not necessarily predict receptor binding when administered in humans. We therefore believe human clinical data is necessary to confirm whether balanced agonism of the FGF receptors is truly achieved. Because certain FGF receptors are expressed predominantly in liver tissue while others are expressed predominantly in peripheral tissue, the extent of binding to different receptors can be assessed from the pharmacodynamic effects in human clinical trials. Increases in adiponectin, for example, depend on activation of FGFR1c in adipose tissue. We believe EFX’s balanced effects when administered in human clinical trials confirm that EFX’s unique engineering results in balanced agonism in vivo as well as in vitro. 
The effects observed in clinical trials with EFX contrast with observations from clinical trials evaluating certain pegylated or glycopegylated FGF21 analogs, which we believe may be attributed to the potential for pegylated moieties to accumulate in the liver. For example, each of two FGF21 analogs for which histology results have been reported publicly, one of which is pegylated and one of which is glycopegylated, were observed to have substantially lower rates of fibrosis improvement than observed with EFX. We also observed more substantial reductions in triglycerides and increases in adiponectin than was reported for these two FGF21 analogs, among other measures. We believe the unique and proprietary engineering of EFX, including its targeted amino acid substitutions and Fc fusion scaffold, as described 

12



above, may be responsible for the differentiated clinical effects observed after treatment with EFX compared with other pegylated FGF21 analogs. 
EFX exerts both metabolic and anti-fibrotic effects with a favorable cardiovascular profile
We believe intervening across the core processes underlying NASH pathogenesis is the most effective way to restore health to the liver of patients with NASH and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is the leading contributor to mortality and morbidity among these patients. By mimicking FGF21, EFX has the potential to intervene in each of the core processes underlying NASH pathogenesis acting as both a metabolic and anti-fibrotic therapeutic agent. EFX acts to leverage whole-body metabolism to redirect calories away from the liver to peripheral tissues, including adipose tissue, thereby reducing fat deposited in the liver and decreasing the rate of fat oxidation by the liver. Through this activity, EFX reduces fibrosis both indirectly, as a result of alleviating hepatocyte stress, and directly, by suppressing local inflammation and activation of collagen secreting myofibroblasts that lay down fibrotic tissue.
Overview of EFX Clinical Development
We have two active EFX programs supported by two ongoing, parallel Phase 2b clinical trials: the HARMONY study in pre-cirrhotic patients with F2-F3 fibrosis, and the SYMMETRY study in cirrhotic patients with compensated, F4 fibrosis. As illustrated below, each of our two Phase 2b clinical trials are precedented by Phase 2a data in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH. We believe that the longer study durations of 24 and 36 weeks in our Phase 2b trials, compared with 16 weeks for the BALANCED study, are likely to show a further improvement in resolution of fibrosis and NASH. 
Summary of EFX Clinical Trials in Patients with NASH
EFX has been administered to a total of 162 patients with either NASH (n=79) or T2D (n=83) for up to 16 weeks in three prior clinical trials: (a) a single-ascending dose study in patients with T2D, (b) a four-week, multiple-ascending dose study in patients with T2D, and (c) the Phase 2a BALANCED study in patients with NASH, which consisted of a main study in patients with pre-cirrhotic (F1-F3) NASH and an expansion cohort in patients with cirrhosis (F4, compensated). We believe the combined results of these trials provide compelling evidence for EFX’s potential to address all core aspects of NASH pathogenesis, which will be further evaluated in the HARMONY and SYMMETRY studies. If approved, we believe these attributes of EFX may allow it to emerge as a foundational NASH monotherapy.

13



EFX for Treatment of Pre-Cirrhotic NASH (F2-F3)
Our lead program focuses on development of EFX for treatment of pre-cirrhotic NASH (F2-F3 fibrosis). The ongoing Phase 2b HARMONY study in patients with F2-F3 fibrosis is supported by data from the BALANCED study in patients with F1-F3 fibrosis. At baseline, roughly two thirds of the patients randomized in the BALANCED study had F2 or F3 fibrosis, and about one-third had F1 fibrosis. The magnitude of effects we observed, coupled with the consistency of positive effects across multiple measures, increase our confidence that similar results will be observed in the HARMONY study. 
Phase 2a clinical trial of EFX in patients with biopsy-confirmed F1-F3 NASH
The main portion of the Phase 2a BALANCED study was a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging clinical trial in adult patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH (F1-F3), a NAS score of at least 4, and baseline liver fat of at least 10% on MRI-PDFF screening. Patients were randomized to receive once-weekly subcutaneous doses of either 28, 50 or 70mg of EFX (n=59) or placebo (n=21) for 16 weeks. The primary endpoint was absolute reduction in liver fat at week 12 as measured by MRI-PDFF. Additional secondary and exploratory measures included noninvasive measures of liver function, fibrosis biomarkers, insulin sensitivity, lipoproteins and body weight, as well as histological measures based on liver biopsies. 

EFX reduced liver fat
As summarized in the table below, highly statistically significant absolute reductions of 12 to 14 percent and relative reductions of 63 to 71 percent of liver fat were observed for the 28, 50 and 70mg dose groups, respectively, compared with 0.3 and 0 for placebo. More than two-thirds of EFX patients achieved at least a 50 percent relative reduction in liver fat and more than half of EFX patients achieved at least a 70 percent relative reduction of liver fat. In addition, 25 to 67 percent of EFX patients normalized their liver fat levels, which is defined as less than or equal to 5 percent absolute liver fat content. Based on the results of additional post-hoc analyses of liver fat reduction, we believe normalization of liver fat rather than a relative reduction of at least 30 percent liver fat may be a more reliable predictor of histological improvement, particularly NASH resolution.

EFX improved markers of liver injury 
The substantial reductions in liver fat among EFX patients correlated with various markers of liver health, including the liver enzyme ALT, as shown in the figure below. Each of the EFX groups achieved highly statistically significant ALT reductions of about 40 percent by week 8 and sustained these reductions through the post-treatment follow-up at week 20. Similar dose-related improvements were observed for other liver health markers, including AST, GGT, ALP, and uric acid. We believe the rapid and sustained reductions in ALT are particularly noteworthy as ALT reductions have been positively correlated with histological response.

EFX improved noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis 
EFX was observed to significantly improve two important noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis. Pro-C3 is a serum biomarker of collagen synthesis and fibrogenesis in the liver. The Enhanced Liver Fibrosis, or ELF, score is a composite biomarker that has strong correlations with fibrosis stage. Reductions in Pro-C3 indicate lower levels of new fibrosis formation while reductions in the ELF score suggest lower overall fibrosis. Pro-C3 and the ELF score are clinically important because they 1) quantitate fibrotic activity throughout the liver rather than in a single segment of the liver and 2) are noninvasive and therefore can be measured repeatedly over time, thus overcoming two core limitations of liver biopsy. As shown in the table below at left, we observed highly significant absolute reductions in Pro-C3 of about 6-7 ug/L across EFX dose groups, compared with a reduction of 1.5 ug/L for placebo. As shown in the table below at right, we also observed highly significant reductions in ELF score of 0.70, 0.75 and 0.44 for the 28mg, 50mg and 70mg EFX groups, compared with a nominal increase for placebo.

EFX improved histology, as measured by both fibrosis improvement and NASH resolution
EFX was observed to have positive results on each of two histology endpoints defined by both the FDA and EMA for use in Phase 3 registrational trials. The BALANCED study generated biopsy results among treatment responders, where response was defined as achieving at least a 30 percent relative reduction in liver fat as measured by MRI-PDFF at week 12. Among patients with a week 12 MRI-PDFF measurement, only two out of 20 placebo patients were responders, or 10 percent, compared with 100 percent among 48 EFX patients. A total of 42 biopsies were collected from placebo (n=2) and EFX patients (n=40). Although the BALANCED study wasn’t powered for statistical analysis of these secondary endpoints, the results were encouraging. 
The following figure summarizes the proportion of patients with fibrosis improvement of greater than or equal to one stage without worsening of NASH. Fibrosis improvement without worsening of NASH was 48 percent across EFX dose groups compared to zero percent in the placebo group, with responses for individual EFX dose groups ranging from 36 to 62 percent. The 62 percent rate among patients treated with 50mg EFX is among the strongest fibrosis improvement results reported to date among published NASH clinical trial results.

3 Secondary and exploratory histological endpoints were not powered for statistical significance
​
The substantial levels of fibrosis improvement shown above are driven more by patients with F2 or F3 fibrosis at baseline, rather than patients with F1 fibrosis. As illustrated in the figures below, while 55% of the total population of biopsied patients with F1-F3 fibrosis at baseline experienced an improvement in fibrosis, 68% of the subset of patients with baseline fibrosis of F2 or F3 experienced at least a one-stage improvement in fibrosis. Moreover, 50% of patients with F2 or F3 fibrosis at baseline experienced a two-stage improvement in fibrosis. These histological results following only 16 weeks of treatment underscore EFX’s potential to achieve rapid fibrosis improvement among patients with advanced NASH. Published guidance by FDA recommends that surrogate histological endpoints be used in Phase 3 trials evaluating treatment with investigational therapy in patients with F2-F3 but not F1 fibrosis. We are therefore encouraged by the results observed in the subset of BALANCED patients with F2-F3 fibrosis, the patient population currently being evaluated in our Phase 2b HARMONY study. We are not aware of any published data showing a comparable proportion of two-stage improvement in fibrosis among F2-F3 patients following any treatment duration, let alone following only 16 weeks of treatment.

The figure below shows the biopsy results for patients who achieved NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis. High levels of NASH resolution were observed across all EFX dose groups, with a combined 19 patients across EFX dose groups for an overall 48 percent response rate. With only two placebo patients in the biopsy analysis set, a meaningful comparison of histologic improvement against placebo is not possible. A single placebo patient with a positive response resulted in a 50 percent placebo response rate for NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis. Notably, this one placebo patient had an 11%, or 25-pound, reduction in body weight over 16 weeks.

EFX improved glycemic control, reduced body weight and restored a healthy lipoprotein profile
As summarized in the following table, treatment with EFX was also associated with improvements in multiple metabolic parameters, including markers of glycemic control, body weight, and lipoproteins. This favorable metabolic profile is important because cardiovascular disease remains the greatest mortality risk for patients with NASH. The BALANCED study shows that EFX has the potential to be consistent with the FDA guidance by improving multiple metabolic parameters or (as in the case of LDL) not causing any worsening of major risk factors.

​
EFX’s potential to improve glycemic control is an important feature of its therapeutic profile because more than half of patients with F2-F3 fibrosis also have T2D, which is generally poorly controlled. FDA encourages later-stage NASH clinical trials to stratify for T2D status, signifying the importance of assessing the unique impact of any therapy on patients with both NASH and T2D. As illustrated below, EFX treatment resulted in absolute reductions in HbA1c of 0.1%, 0.4% and 0.5% for the 28, 50 and 70mg doses, respectively, compared with an increase of 0.1% for placebo. These results exceeded our expectations because EFX was dosed on top of antidiabetic medications for the approximately 50% of patients in the study with T2D. EFX’s insulin sensitizing benefits are seen more clearly in the subpopulation of patients with T2D, who had reductions in HbA1c of 0.6 and 0.9 for the 50 and 70mg dose groups.

The overall improvement in glycemic control is consistent with observations previously reported by Amgen after treating T2D patients for 4 weeks, underscoring the reproducibility of this effect. Achieving better glycemic control by improving insulin sensitization is highly desirable because it is rectifying the fundamental driver of T2D, which is insulin resistance. This means EFX has the potential to achieve a sustained reduction in HbA1c, in contrast to diabetes therapies that promote insulin secretion whose efficacy wanes over time. 
The improvement in glycemic control at 50 and 70mg was accompanied by mean reductions in body weight of 2.3 and 3.7kg, after 16 weeks, corresponding to a mean decrease of 5 and 8 pounds. The trend toward weight loss observed with EFX contrasts with another class of insulin sensitizers, the PPAR gamma agonists. This class includes established antidiabetic drugs like pioglitazone, whose use has declined substantially because of weight gain and edema, and lanifibranor, which has been associated with weight gain of about 2.4-2.7kg and 6 to 8% edema. The weight loss observed with EFX also contrasts with the weight gain observed with another FGF21 analog targeting only the FGFR1c receptor. We believe the potential for weight loss will be attractive to clinicians and NASH patients. 
These encouraging metabolic data are best viewed holistically rather than in isolation. The BALANCED study showed that EFX has the potential to rectify each aspect of the metabolic dysfunction associated with NASH: improved glycemic control through enhanced insulin sensitivity, restoration of a healthy lipoprotein profile and reduced body weight. These broad-based improvements increase our confidence that the rapid reduction of steatohepatitis and collagen deposition seen in BALANCED could be sustained over longer treatment periods. The magnitude of metabolic improvements, particularly regarding lipoproteins that are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, also points to the potential of EFX to achieve meaningful reductions in markers of cardiovascular risk. 
In summary, while head-to-head preclinical studies and clinical trials have not been conducted, we believe the breadth of desirable clinical effects elicited by EFX sets it apart from other candidates in development for NASH, which frequently trade off efficacy improvements against detrimental effects on lipoproteins, increased body weight, and/or no improvement in glycemic control. With EFX, we see potential to restore a healthy metabolic profile not only to the liver, but also to the whole body. The results are consistent with our predictions based on FGF21 biology and EFX’s engineering. 
EFX appeared to be equally effective among certain genetic subpopulations at increased risk of disease progression
Post-hoc analyses of BALANCED study data were conducted to assess the effectiveness of EFX in treating certain genetic subpopulations of NASH patients with increased risk of disease progression. For example, patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3, or PNPLA3, which plays an important role in lipid droplet metabolism, was genotyped in 42 EFX-treated patients. A genetic variant in PNPLA3, known as "I148M", has been shown to increase the risk of progression to advanced NASH and hepatocellular carcinoma. The 42 genotyped EFX-treated patients were assigned to 3 groups based on their PNPLA3 genotype: low- (n=11), medium- (n=22) and high-risk (n=9). Similar histologic responses to EFX were observed across all three PNPLA3 genotypes, with a trend toward a greater improvement in steatohepatitis and fibrosis in the high-risk group patients. Improvements in metabolic and liver-related biomarkers were comparable across PNPLA3 genotypes. Based on these analyses, we believe EFX may be effective in patients with NASH across all PNPLA3 genotypes, including those at highest risk of disease progression.
EFX was generally well tolerated
EFX was generally well tolerated in the BALANCED study. There were no deaths in the study and there were two Serious Adverse Events, or SAEs, one of which occurred prior to dosing and the second of which was related to acute pancreatitis in a patient who was morbidly obese with high insulin resistance at baseline. Across EFX groups, the most frequent Adverse Events, or AEs, were grade 1 or 2 gastrointestinal events, which were transient in nature. There were no discontinuations due to treatment-emergent AEs in the 50 mg dose group and no discontinuations due to the most common AE, diarrhea. There were no treatment-related effects on blood pressure, heart rate, or bone mineral density.
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity following treatment with EFX. The detection of anti-drug antibody, or ADA, formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. In 

20



the evaluable subjects receiving at least 1 dose of EFX, our assay detected the formation of ADAs in 72% of EFX patients, with none in the placebo group. Measured antibody titers were low, with a median observed titer value of less than 1:9 at 20 weeks. In addition, only 4 EFX-treated patients demonstrated emergence of FGF21 cross-reactive antibodies, with only a single subject testing positive for neutralizing antibodies at a single time point who subsequently tested negative for ADAs. There was no discernible effect on safety, tolerability, or efficacy parameters among patients with ADA formation.
Phase 2b clinical trial of EFX in patients with biopsy-confirmed pre-cirrhotic NASH (F2-F3) for 24 weeks
The Phase 2b HARMONY study is a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH (F2-F3), a NAS score of at least 4, and baseline liver fat of at least 8% on MRI-PDFF screening. A total of 128 patients have been randomized to receive once-weekly subcutaneous doses of either 28 or 50mg of EFX or placebo for 24 weeks. 
The primary endpoint of the HARMONY study is the proportion of subjects who achieve at least a one-stage improvement in fibrosis based on paired liver biopsies at week 24. Additional secondary and exploratory measures include noninvasive measures of liver function, fibrosis biomarkers, insulin sensitivity, lipoproteins and body weight, as well as other histological measures based on liver biopsies. 
We completed enrollment for the HARMONY study in less than a year, with the last patient randomized on February 8, 2022. We expect to report results in the third quarter of this year. Based on these results, we plan to request an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with FDA to review the 24-week biopsy results and finalize our Phase 3 program design, including dose selection, study sample size and duration. 
As is customary for Phase 2 clinical trials, the HARMONY data safety monitoring board was convened to undertake a pre-specified review of all available safety data after a pre-determined number of subjects had received a pre-defined number of doses. There were no changes recommended to the study protocol
Phase 2b HARMONY Trial Design
EFX for Treatment of Cirrhotic NASH
Cirrhotic (F4) NASH presents high unmet medical need, with approximately 50 percent of patients with cirrhosis dying within 5 years absent a liver transplant. This means the risk of liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as need for liver transplantation, is substantially higher for cirrhotic patients. The FDA has issued draft guidance specific to the development of investigational therapies for patients with cirrhotic NASH, who are projected to number more than 3.5 million patients in the United States by 2030. According to the FDA, the treatment goal for cirrhotic patients is to halt disease progression, thereby preventing clinical decompensation, reducing the incidence of liver transplantation, and improving survival.
​

21



A recent analysis showed reversal of cirrhosis was associated with an 80% reduction in risk of liver-related clinical events, emphasizing the medical benefit to be gained if a therapy can reverse patients out of cirrhosis. To date, public reports of other investigational NASH drugs in clinical development for treatment of cirrhotic NASH have failed to demonstrate evidence of reversing fibrosis. However, we believe EFX has the potential to be the first therapy approved to treat patients with cirrhosis due to NASH, and to potentially reverse compensated cirrhosis.
​
Phase 2a expansion cohort of EFX in patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhotic NASH (F4, compensated)
We expanded the BALANCED study to include a cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis (F4), Child-Pugh Class A, which was called Cohort C, to assess the potential for EFX to be effective among cirrhotic patients. Thirty patients were randomized to receive either EFX (n=20) or placebo (n=10) for 16 weeks. The primary endpoint for Cohort C was to assess safety and tolerability of EFX in treatment of patients with cirrhotic NASH. Additional noninvasive efficacy measures were included as secondary and exploratory endpoints, including liver enzymes, markers of liver fibrosis, and measures of insulin insensitivity. The Cohort C protocol was amended to include voluntary end-of-treatment biopsies to assess whether histological improvements in patients NASH were evident after just 16 weeks of treatment. The figure below summarizes the design of the Cohort C trial.

EFX improved histology, as measured by fibrosis improvement and NASH resolution
Results were obtained from a total of 17 of the 30 Cohort C study participants who volunteered for end-of-treatment biopsies, including placebo (n=5) and EFX patients (n=12). The figure below shows the biopsy results for patients who achieved fibrosis improvement without worsening of NASH (33% of EFX patients compared with 0% of placebo patients), and NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis (25% of EFX patients compared with 0% of placebo patients). There was no overlap between responders for each of these two endpoints. Accordingly, a total of 7 of 12 EFX patients, or 58%, showed histological improvements, compared with 0 placebo patients. We believe these results are encouraging given that they were obtained after only 16 weeks of treatment.

3 Study not powered to assess statistical significance of changes in histological endpoints
4 NAS score of 0 or 1 for lobular inflammation and a score of 0 for ballooning; no worsening of fibrosis
​
EFX improved noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis 
As with the BALANCED main study, EFX was observed to significantly improve two important noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis among patients with cirrhosis due to NASH. These two measures supplement the liver biopsy results because they quantitate fibrotic activity across the whole liver and were collected for all patients, not only those who volunteered for end-of-treatment biopsies. As shown in the table below at left, we observed a significant absolute reduction in Pro-C3 of 9 ug/L for EFX, compared with a reduction of 3.4 ug/L for placebo. As shown in the table below at right, we also observed a significant reduction in ELF score of 0.4 compared to an increase of 0.3 for placebo. The improvements in noninvasive measures of liver fibrosis for all EFX-treated patients appear consistent with the histological improvements observed for the subset of patients who volunteered for end-of-treatment biopsies.

EFX was generally well tolerated
EFX was generally well tolerated in Cohort C. There were no deaths. One patient in the placebo arm reported an SAE of pulmonary embolism. One placebo patient withdrew consent and one patient in the EFX arm discontinued due to AEs. This patient experienced abdominal distension, constipation, diarrhea and pruritus, discontinuing treatment at Week 5. The most frequently reported study drug-related treatment-emergent AEs were transient mild-to-moderate diarrhea and nausea, which often resolved on study without treatment. All injection site reactions were grade 1. There were no reports of tremor. 
Phase 2b clinical trial of EFX in patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhotic NASH (F4, compensated) for 36 weeks
The Phase 2b SYMMETRY study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhotic NASH (F4, compensated), Child-Pugh class A. Patients are being randomized to receive once-weekly subcutaneous dosing of 28mg or 50mg EFX, or placebo. The primary endpoint for the trial is fibrosis regression at 36 weeks. To provide additional safety data, patients will continue to receive EFX or placebo after 36 weeks during a long-term follow-up period. 

24



The primary endpoint of the SYMMETRY study is the proportion of subjects who achieve at least a one-stage improvement in fibrosis (i.e.reversal of cirrhosis) based upon liver biopsies at week 36 by reference to pre-treatment biopsies. Additional secondary and exploratory measures include noninvasive measures of liver health and function, fibrosis biomarkers, insulin sensitivity, lipoproteins, and body weight, as well as other histological measures based on liver biopsies. 
Phase 2b SYMMETRY study design
​
Phase 1b clinical trial of EFX in patients with T2D for 4 weeks
A Phase 1b clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of EFX in patients with T2D. This trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending multiple-dose clinical trial. Sixty-nine patients enrolled into one of eight cohorts were randomized to receive EFX (n=52, with roughly six patients per group) or placebo (n=17). Doses of 7, 21, 70 and 140mg were administered subcutaneously either once every two weeks, or Q2W, or once weekly, or QW, for 4 weeks. 
EFX exhibited linear, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics
Linear, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics were observed across the range of EFX doses tested. The observed median time of maximum serum concentration, or Tmax, ranged from two to 3.5 days. The observed half-life of biologically active EFX ranged from three to four days. Biologically active FGF21 requires an intact C-terminus. 
As shown in the figure below, there was an approximately two-fold accumulation of EFX observed in serum following repeated QW administration, with steady state achieved by the third or fourth dose. No meaningful accumulation was observed following administration of two Q2W doses. QW dosing was also associated with a four-fold smaller peak-to-trough ratio than observed with Q2W dosing, suggesting that serum concentrations of EFX are maintained more effectively with QW than Q2W dosing.

25



Pharmacokinetics of EFX administered weekly and every other week
​
Dose-related effects on pharmacodynamic measures were observed for both the QW and Q2W cohorts, with maximal or near-maximal effects achieved with the 70mg QW dose of EFX. Significant decreases in triglycerides and increases in HDL-C were observed for all QW dose groups, with additional significant decreases in non-HDL-C observed at doses greater than or equal to 70mg QW. Significant increases in triglycerides and increases in HDL-C were also observed at Q2W doses greater than or equal to 70 and 21mg Q2W, respectively, illustrating the biological impact of EFX’s half-life extension of three to four days even with an inter-dose interval equivalent to four half-lives.
Multiple markers of insulin sensitivity, including C-peptide, HOMA-IR and adiponectin, were also observed to be improved after just 4 weeks of dosing. There was also a trend toward slight weight loss at the 70 and 140mg QW doses, which we do not believe contributed to the substantial improvement of lipoproteins and markers of insulin sensitivity. The positive effects on insulin sensitivity and body weight were only observed among the QW cohorts and not seen when dosed once every two weeks. 
A comparison of the magnitude of pharmacodynamic changes between the 70mg QW and 140mg Q2W cohorts informed our decision to pursue only weekly dosing in additional clinical trials. Each of the 70mg QW and 140mg Q2W doses yielded approximately equivalent total drug exposure (7-day exposure of 31,900 day*ng/mL for 70mg QW vs. 14-day exposure of 55,600 day*ng/mL for 140mg Q2W). However, the magnitude and level of significance for effects at 70mg QW were much higher than at 140mg Q2W. On most measures, the effects observed at 70mg QW were at least two-fold higher than the corresponding changes at 140mg Q2W. We believe the higher sustained exposure observed with QW administration, with its four-fold smaller peak-to-trough ratio, is necessary to achieve desirable insulin-sensitizing effects, which we believe are critical to treating patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH.
Exclusive license agreement with Amgen Inc.
In June 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Amgen Inc., or Amgen, pursuant to which we have been granted an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Amgen, to commercially develop, manufacture, use, distribute and sell therapeutic products, or Products. In particular, we have been granted licenses under patents filed in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions that are owned or controlled by Amgen, including an exclusive license under certain patents claiming polypeptides comprised of an FGF21 portion with certain point mutations, a linker, and an Fc domain. Our exclusively licensed patents include, but are not limited to, the composition of EFX and methods of using the same. In connection with the license, Amgen also licensed and transferred to us certain know-how related to the manufacture of EFX as well as certain quantities of EFX drug 

26



substance manufactured to Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, for clinical use, master cell bank, not-for-human use EFX drug product suitable for nonclinical studies and critical reagents.

In addition, Amgen provided us, at its expense, consulting support in connection with the transfer of the licensed materials and the exploitation of the Products. We are also entitled to sublicense the rights granted to us under the license agreement.
As initial consideration for the license, we paid Amgen an upfront payment of $5.0 million and also issued 2,653,333 shares of our Series A preferred stock to Amgen at the time of the initial closing in June 2018 with a subsequent 3,205,128 shares of our Series A preferred stock issued at the time of the second closing in November 2018, representing 10% of total shares outstanding at such times. In August 2019 we made an additional payment of $2.5 million in connection with dosing the first patient in our Phase 2a clinical trial, which was the first development milestone under the license agreement. As additional consideration for the license, we are required to pay Amgen $7.5 million in connection with dosing the first patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial, up to $30.0 million in connection with marketing approvals, and aggregate milestone payments of up to $75.0 million upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones for all products licensed under the Amgen Agreement. No commercial milestones have been achieved to date under the license agreement. We are also required to pay tiered royalties of low to high single-digit percentages on annual net sales of the products covered by the license. The royalty rate with respect to the net sales is subject to customary reductions, including in the event that the exploitation of a Product is not covered by a valid claim with the licensed patent rights. The royalty term will terminate on a country-by-country basis on the later of (i) the expiration date of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights, (ii) the loss of regulatory exclusivity in such country, and (iii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
The license agreement shall expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term for the Products in the territory. Upon expiration of the license agreement, the licenses granted to us shall be considered fully paid-up, irrevocable and non-exclusive. Either we or Amgen may terminate the license agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement or defaults in the performance thereunder and fails to cure that breach within 90 days (or 30 days in the case of failure to make any payment as and when due under the agreement) after written notice is provided or in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or winding up. Amgen shall have the right to terminate the license agreement in full upon written notice to us in the event we, our affiliates or sublicensees, directly challenge the patentability, enforceability or validity of any licensed patents, unless, in the event of a sublicensee challenge, we terminate the sublicense within 60 days’ notice. We shall have the right to terminate the license agreement within 90 days written notice to Amgen if we conclude, due to scientific, technical, regulatory or commercial reasons, that the exploitation of the Products is no longer commercially practicable.
Intellectual property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements. Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it through a variety of approaches, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, novel biological discoveries, new targets and applications, and other inventions that are important to our business. For our product candidates, we generally intend to pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter, methods of making and methods of use, including combination therapies. As we continue the development of our product candidates, we intend to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including through claims covering additional methods of use and biomarkers and complementary diagnostic and/or companion diagnostic related claims. As of February 7, 2022, we have licensed from Amgen Inc. approximately 176 patents and pending patent applications worldwide, including 154 issued patents and 22 pending patent applications. There are currently no pending U.S. provisional patent applications.
As of February 7, 2022, our patent portfolio relating to EFX includes twelve issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, and issued and pending foreign counterpart patents in Europe, Asia, Canada, Australia, and 

27



Mexico. Seven issued U.S. patents include claims directed to the EFX product, the FGF21 polypeptide component of the EFX product, nucleic acids encoding the product and related polypeptides, polypeptide multimers, related compositions, and methods of using EFX to, e.g., treat diabetes, lower blood glucose in patients suffering from a metabolic disorder, improve glucose tolerance, lower body weight, or reduce triglyceride levels in patients. These issued U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2029. The pending U.S. patent application and related foreign counterparts are directed to a method of treating a patient with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); if issued, the resulting U.S. patent is expected to expire in 2029. We currently anticipate that a composition of matter patent will be eligible for patent term extension to 2034 in the U.S. The portfolio further includes five issued U.S. patents that are directed to related polypeptides and methods of use.
In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with our collaborators and scientific advisors, and non-solicitation, confidentiality, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We have also executed agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee, however, that we have executed such agreements with all applicable counterparties, such agreements will not be breached, or that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights. For more information, see "Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property."
Manufacturing and supply
We manage several external commercial manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to develop and manufacture EFX.
EFX drug substance, or DS, is manufactured by fermentation of a recombinant strain of the bacterium E. coli. Product accumulates as insoluble particles (inclusion bodies) within the cells and is recovered by cell disruption, followed by solubilization of the inclusion bodies, protein refolding and several chromatographic separation steps to yield product with target quality attributes. We have an agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim, to manufacture DS for clinical development and plan to enter into a future agreement for commercial supply at an appropriate time. Whereas our Phase 2a BALANCED study was supplied by DS acquired by Amgen, our ongoing Phase 2b HARMONY and SYMMETRY studies are being supplied by DS manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim. Yield of the Boehringer Ingelheim DS manufactured to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) was shown to be comparable to the Amgen DS. Analysis of the Boehringer Ingelheim GMP DS confirmed it met the same release specification as previously used for Amgen GMP DS and was comparable to Amgen GMP DS across a number of protein characterization studies. 
We have an agreement with Vetter Pharma International GmbH, or Vetter, to manufacture EFX drug product, or DP, for clinical development and plan to enter into a future agreement for commercial supply at an appropriate time. The GMP DP being used for our ongoing HARMONY and SYMMETRY studies is similar to that for the BALANCED study, which is stored as a frozen liquid until immediately before administration to trial subjects. Analysis of the Vetter GMP DP confirmed that it met the same release specification as previously used for the DP manufactured from Amgen GMP DS.
We plan to use a newly developed lyophilized DP for Phase 3 clinical trials and as the commercial presentation, if EFX is approved. This new DP formulation is currently in the process of scale-up at Vetter. Development of a combination drug product/device for convenient subcutaneous administration is proceeding in parallel at Vetter, employing Vetter’s Lyo-Ject 3S device.

Sales and marketing
Successful marketing of a new drug for the treatment of NASH will require a targeted commercial infrastructure. We expect to begin making plans for commercialization following in parallel with our ongoing HARMONY and SYMMETRY studies. We have also contracted with a third-party manufacturer, Vetter, to support clinical development and the potential commercialization of EFX with commercial-scale manufacturing. We intend to develop the commercial infrastructure required for bringing EFX to patients in the United States, if approved, in parallel with an anticipated Phase 3 clinical trial. We also plan to evaluate options for delivering EFX, if approved, to patients in other key markets, such as Europe, Japan and China, which may include strategic collaborations.
Competition
The biotechnology industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our competitors include multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. 
We understand that a number of pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie, Inc., AstraZeneca PLC/MedImmune LLC, Boehringer Ingelheim AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Inc., Eisai, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Novo Nordisk A/S, Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding AG, Sanofi and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, as well as large and small biotechnology companies such as Albireo Pharma, Inc., Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Altimmune, Inc., Amgen, Inc., Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Axcella Health, Inc., Boston Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cirius Therapeutics, Inc., CohBar, Inc., CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc., 89bio, D&D Pharmatech, Inc., Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Galectin Therapeutics Inc., Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Hanmi Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd., Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Inventiva Pharma SA, Ionics Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MediciNova, Inc., North Sea Pharmaceuticals, Poxel SA, Sagimet Biosciences, Inc., Terns Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Viking Therapeutics, Inc. are or may be pursuing the development or marketing of pharmaceuticals that target NASH. It is also probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of serious metabolic diseases, such as NASH, will increase. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market technologically superior products. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in undertaking nonclinical studies and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products and in obtaining regulatory approvals of human therapeutic products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA approval for superior products. Many of our competitors have established distribution channels for the commercialization of their products, whereas we have no such channel or capabilities. In addition, many competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive collaborative relationships. Smaller and earlier-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidate or any future product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than we are in manufacturing and marketing their products. If we are unable to compete effectively against these companies, then we may not be able to commercialize our product candidate or any future product candidates or achieve a competitive position in the market. This would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue. Our competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Government Regulation 
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, 

29



marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics, medical devices and combinations of biologics and devices, or combination products, such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various nonclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. 
U.S. biological product development 
In the United States, biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval of a clinical trial protocol and related documentation by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to FDA's regulations commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing authorization that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product's identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA in accordance with any applicable expedited programs or designations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA (unless a fee waiver applies); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Nonclinical and clinical development 
Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product biological characteristics, chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP regulations and requirements. 
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of the nonclinical tests, including animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt 

30



by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within the 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to, among other considerations, unreasonable or significant safety concerns, inability to assess safety concerns, lack of qualified investigators, a misleading or materially incomplete investigator brochure, study design deficiencies, interference with the conduct or completion of a study designed to be adequate and well-controlled for the same or another investigational drug, insufficient quantities of investigational product, lack of effectiveness, or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing a clinical trial to begin, or that, once begun, issues or circumstances will not arise that delay, suspend or terminate such studies. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor's control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used in monitoring subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its related documentation before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. 
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA. The FDA may accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary. 
Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the cases of some products for severe of life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in the targeted patient population. 
Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning Phase 3 clinical trials. 
Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval or licensure and product labeling.

31



In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. 
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor, acting on its own or based on a recommendation from the sponsor's data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
BLA submission and review 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. 
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Under the performance goals and policies implemented by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA targets ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. In both standard and priority reviews, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the BLA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a "filing" decision. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 

32



Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a proposed product is safe, pure and potent, for its intended use, and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product's continued safety, purity and potency. Further, the FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve a product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
Expedited development and review programs 
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs do not change the standards for approval but may help expedite the development or approval process. To be eligible for Fast Track designation, new biological products must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new biologic may request the FDA to designate the biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. One benefit of Fast Track designation, for example, is that the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application for a product that has received Fast Track designation on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted. 

33



Under the FDA's breakthrough therapy program, products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may be eligible for the benefits of the Fast Track program when preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates that such product may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. Additionally, the FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product receives timely advice and interactive communications to help the sponsor design and conduct a development program as efficiently as possible. 
Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and has the potential, if approved, to provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Under priority review, the FDA's goal is to review an application in six months once it is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review. 
Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval (also referred to as Subpart E approval). Biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments, as demonstrated by a surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint, may receive accelerated approval. Specifically, this means that they may be approved on the basis of clinical data establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires that a sponsor of a biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing confirmatory clinical trials to verify the clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Pediatric information 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 of Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints, and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. 
Post-Approval requirements 
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for ongoing compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from 

34



cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. For certain commercial prescription biologic products, manufacturers and other parties involved in the supply chain must also meet chain of distribution requirements and build electronic, interoperable systems for product tracking and tracing and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or other products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

​
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product's labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer's communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission data of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In addition, a patent can only be extended once and only for a single product. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our patents, if and as applicable, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. 
A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods, including some regulatory exclusivity periods tied to patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be 

35



granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued "Written Request" for such a study. 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. 
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
Under the BPCIA, a reference biological product is granted a 12 year exclusivity periods from the time of first licensure of the product. The FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and the FDA will not approve an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until twelve years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. "First licensure" typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the "first licensure" of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor. 
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty. 
Regulation of Combination Products in the United States
Certain products may be comprised of components, such as drug components, biologic components and device components, that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities, and frequently by different 

36



centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be: 

● | a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, or device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any investigational drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Under the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. The designation of a lead center generally eliminates the need to receive approvals from more than one FDA center for combination products, although it does not preclude consultations by the lead center with another FDA center. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute. 
A combination product with biologic primary mode of action, such as a biologic dispensed in a pre-filled syringe, generally would be reviewed and licensed pursuant to the biologic licensing processes under the PHS Act. In reviewing the BLA application for such a product, however, FDA reviewers in the drug or biologics center could consult with their counterparts in the device center to ensure that the device component of the combination product met applicable requirements regarding safety, effectiveness, durability and performance. 
Following approval of a combination product, each component of a combination product retains their regulatory status (as a biologic or device, for example) and is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component. Accordingly, under FDA regulations, biologic-device combination products are subject to cGMP requirements applicable to both biologics and devices, including the cGMP requirements for biologics and the FDA’s Quality System Regulation applicable to medical devices.
Other U.S. healthcare and Data Privacy laws and compliance requirements 
In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, our clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable. 
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business that may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing authorization. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-

37



kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, and transparency laws and regulations related to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and responsible individuals may be subject to imprisonment. 
Also, many states have similar, and typically more prohibitive, fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, as well as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), impose requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors, or agents of covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances. For example, in California the CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Many of the state laws differ from each other in significant ways and are often not pre-empted by HIPAA, and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
We may develop products that, once approved, may be administered by a physician. Under currently applicable U.S. law, certain products not usually self-administered (including injectable drugs) may be eligible for coverage under Medicare through Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B is part of original Medicare, the federal health care program that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, and covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain pharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary's health condition. As a condition of receiving Medicare Part B reimbursement for a manufacturer's eligible drugs, the manufacturer is required to participate in other government healthcare programs, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities that participate in the program. 
In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price, or ASP, and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors. 
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, within the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 

38



Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts. 
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
Ensuring business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is a costly endeavor. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other current or future governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private "qui tam" actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
Coverage, pricing and reimbursement 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in foreign markets, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors are critical to new product acceptance. 
Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor's determination that use of a therapeutic is:

● | a covered benefit under its health plan;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | safe, effective and medically necessary;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | appropriate for the specific patient;
--+--------------------------------------


● | cost-effective; and
--+--------------------


● | neither experimental nor investigational.
--+------------------------------------------

​
We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage may also be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain regulatory approval. 

39



Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our product on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A third-party payor's decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Private third-party payors tend to follow Medicare coverage and reimbursement limitations to a substantial degree, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Therefore, one payor's determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop. 
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
Healthcare reform 
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 

40



For example, the Affordable Care Act has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers. Among the Affordable Care Act provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:

● | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs that began in 2011;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70%, the current discount owed as of January 1, 2019 pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or BBA) point-of-sale discounts, off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers' outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals beginning in 2014 and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the FCA and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establishment of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a licensure framework for follow on biologic products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

​
Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the Fifth Circuit Court and the United States Supreme Court, and the Trump Administration has issued various Executive Orders which eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Additionally, Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. It is unclear whether the ACA will be overturned, repealed, replaced, or further amended. We cannot predict what affect further changes to the ACA would have on our business, especially under the Biden administration.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the former Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 included a $135 billion allowance to support legislative 

41



proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March 10, 2020, the former administration sent “principles” for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses, and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Further, the former administration also previously released a "Blueprint", or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will challenge, reverse, revoke or otherwise modify these executive and administrative actions after January 20, 2021. 
In addition, there have been several changes to the 340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that certain drug and biologic manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities. It is unclear how these developments could affect covered hospitals who might purchase our future products and affect the rates we may charge such facilities for our approved products in the future, if any. On July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, former President Trump announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the former administration's proposals. In response, the FDA released a final rule on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates will be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. The MFN Model regulations mandate participation by identified Part B providers and would have applied to all U.S. states and territories for a seven-year period beginning January 1, 2021 and ending December 31, 2027. However, in response to a lawsuit filed by several industry groups, on December 28, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction enjoining government defendants from implementing the MFN Rule pending completion of notice-and-comment procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act. On January 13, 2021, in a separate lawsuit brought by industry groups in the U.S. District of Maryland, the government defendants entered a joint motion to stay litigation on the condition that the government would not appeal the preliminary injunction granted in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and that performance for any final regulation stemming from the MFN Interim Final Rule shall not commence earlier than 60 days after publication of that regulation in the Federal Register. Further, authorities in Canada have passed rules designed to safeguard the Canadian drug supply from shortages. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada and the MFN Model may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Additionally, on December 2, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to an order entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the portion of the rule eliminating safe harbor protection for certain rebates related to the sale or purchase of a pharmaceutical product from a manufacturer to a plan sponsor under Medicare Part D has been delayed to January 1, 2026. Further, implementation of this change and new safe harbors for point-of-sale reductions in price for prescription pharmaceutical products and pharmacy benefit manager service fees are currently under review by the Biden administration and may be amended or repealed. While a number of these and other proposed measures may require additional authorization to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 

42



Further, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to request access to certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 
Government regulations outside the United States 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, research and development, clinical trials, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products as well as authorization and approval of our products. 
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, must be submitted for each clinical trial to each country's national competent authority, or NCA, and an independent ethics committee, or EC, much like the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country's requirements, the corresponding clinical trial may proceed. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
In April 2014, the EU adopted the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on January 31, 2022. The new Regulation will be directly applicable in all Member States (and so does not require national implementing legislation in each Member State), and aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical studies in the EU. The main characteristics of the Regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Regulation in Europe 
In the EU, medicinal products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by regulatory authorities at both the EEA and national levels. To obtain regulatory approval of a medicinal product in the EU, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to submit the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with certain exceptions. There are two main types of marketing authorization, or MA, in the EU:

● | The centralized MA is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EU, and in the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), or EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, including medicines produced by as biotechnological process, products as designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products (i.e. gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MA application by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MA application considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of a MA application under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EU and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EU, this national MA can be recognized in other Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States, or CMSs) for their approval. If the CMSs raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the CMSs).

Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EU make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized MAs (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized MAs will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized MA were automatically converted to Great Britain MAs on January 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly 

44



grant a new Great Britain MA. A separate application will, however, still be required. The MHRA also has the power to have regard to MAs approved in EU Member States through decentralized or mutual recognition procedures with a view to more quickly granting an MA in the United Kingdom or Great Britain.
The EU also provides opportunities for exclusivity. For example, in the EU, upon receiving marketing authorization, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator's preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU, during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if an innovative medicinal product gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company could nevertherless also market another version of the product if such company obtained a marketing authorization based on an application with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 
Pediatric development in Europe 
In the EU, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Products that are granted a marketing authorization on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted. 
PRIME designation
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation, where the marketing authorization application will be made through the centralized procedure. Eligible products must target conditions for which there is an unmet medical need (there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment in the EU or, if there is, the new medicine will bring a major therapeutic advantage) and they must demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the EMA’s CHMP 

45



or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. Where, during the course of development, a medicine no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn.
Post-approval controls in the European Union 
The holder of a marketing authorization must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs. 
All new marketing authorization applications must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions. 
All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each European Union Member State and can differ from one country to another. 
Much like the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order, or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States and the Bribery Act of 2010 in the UK. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the UK despite its departure from the European Union.
Payments made to physicians in certain European Union Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician's employer, his or her competent professional organization, and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual European Union Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the European Union Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines, or imprisonment.
Regulation of Combination Products
The EU regulates medical devices and medicinal products separately, through different legislative instruments, and the applicable requirements will vary depending on the type of drug-device combination product. EU guidance has been published to help manufacturers select the right regulatory framework. In the case of drug-delivery products intended to administer a medicinal product where the device and the medicinal product do not form a single integral product, the medicinal product is regulated in accordance with the aforementioned rules while the device part is regulated as a medical device and will have to comply with all the requirements set by Regulation 2017/745, or the Medical Devices Regulation (which became applicable on 26 May 2021 and repealed the EU Council Directive 93/42/EEC, or the Medical Devices Directive). Where the medical device and medicinal product form a single integrated 

46



product (e.g. pre-filled inhalers), if the principal intended action is achieved by the medicine, the product is considered a medicinal product that includes a medical device and the entire product is regulated under the EU pharmaceutical legislation. However, the marketing authorization application for the product should include a CE certificate for the device in accordance with the Medical Devices Regulation or, if not CE marked but would need to be certified if marketed separately, the applicant must include an opinion from a notified body on conformity of device (except for Class I devices). This is a requirement under the new Medical Devices Regulation. 
The characteristics of non-integral devices used for the administration of medicinal products may impact the quality, safety and efficacy profile of the medicinal products. To the extent that administration devices are co-packaged with the medicinal product or, in exceptional cases, where the use of a specific type of administration device is specifically provided for in the product information of the medicinal product, additional information may need to be provided in the MA application for the medicinal product on the characteristics of the medical device(s) that may impact on the quality, safety and/or efficacy of the medicinal product. The requirements regarding quality aspects for integral drug-device combination products, including devices that are co-packaged with medicinal products, are outlined in an EMA guideline which came into effect on January 1, 2022. 
The EU requires that all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the relevant general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I of the Medical Devices Regulation. The most fundamental requirement is that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Regulation, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product, and post-market experience in respect of similar products already marketed. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-declare the conformity of its products with the general safety and performance requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body. Notified Bodies are independent organizations designated by EU countries to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant general safety and performance requirements, the Notified Body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE Mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. 
As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the general safety and performance requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the EU Member States, plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
European data collection 
The collection and use of personal health data in the EEA is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective May 25, 2018. The GDPR imposes more stringent requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities, and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR, and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR introduces 

47



new data protection requirements in the EEA and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules, specifically fines are increased to levels of up to 4% total worldwide annual turnover or up to €20 million (whichever is higher). The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. We are subject to the GDPR if we have a presence or "establishment" in the EEA (e.g. EEA based subsidiary or operations), when conducting clinical trials with EEA based data subjects (whether the trials are conducted directly by us or through a clinical vendor or partner) or offering approved products or services (if relevant) to EEA based data subjects (regardless of whether involving our EEA based subsidiary or operations). The GDPR regulations may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
In addition, further to the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the United Kingdom at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the United Kingdom’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the European Union’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the European Union’s GDPR, the European Commission has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the United Kingdom to countries not regarded by the United Kingdom as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the United Kingdom to the EEA remain free flowing.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom 
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), and the UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. There was a transition period during which EU pharmaceutical laws continued to apply to the UK, which expired on December 31, 2020. However, the EU and the UK have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore largely aligns with current EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation.
Rest of world regulation 
For other countries outside the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Middle East, or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, or criminal prosecution.

Additional regulation 
In addition to the foregoing, local, state and federal laws regarding such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. 
Human Capital Resources
We believe the success of our mission largely depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We believe programs that foster company engagement, diversity, equity and inclusion, growth and development while providing competitive compensation and benefits will attract a diverse population of employees who will bring innovative ideas and creative solutions that will enable the achievement of our goals. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
 ​
As of February 15, 2022, we employed 33 full-time employees, including 22 in research and development and 11 in general and administrative and one part-time employee. Nine of our employees hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective-bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
