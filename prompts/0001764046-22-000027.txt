Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a leading global information services and analytics company serving the scientific research, intellectual property and life sciences end-markets. We provide structured information and analytics to facilitate the discovery, protection and commercialization of scientific research, innovations and brands. Our product portfolio includes well-established, market-leading brands such as Web of Science, Derwent, Cortellis, DRG, CompuMark, MarkMonitor and CPA Global. We believe that our flagship products hold a #1 or #2 global position by revenues across the respective markets they serve, including abstracting and indexing databases, life science regulatory and competitive intelligence and intellectual property protection (including patent, trademarks and domain and brand protection). We serve a large, diverse and global customer base. As of December 31, 2020, we served over 30,000 customers in more than 170 countries, including the top 30 pharmaceutical companies by revenues. We believe that the strong value proposition of our content, user interfaces, visualization and analytical tools, combined with the integration of our products and services into customers’ daily workflows, leads to our substantial customer loyalty as evidenced by their high propensity to renew their subscriptions with us.
Corporations, government agencies, universities, law firms and other professional services organizations around the world depend on our high-value, curated content, analytics and services. Unstructured data has grown exponentially over the last decade. This trend has resulted in a critical need for unstructured data to be meaningfully filtered, analyzed and curated into relevant information that facilitates key operational and strategic decisions made by businesses, academic institutions and governments worldwide. Our highly curated, proprietary information created through our sourcing, aggregation, verification, translation and categorization of data has resulted in our solutions being embedded in our customers’ workflow and decision-making processes.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated approximately $1,254,047 of revenues. We generated recurring revenues through our subscription-based model and re-occurring revenue transactions, which accounted for 76.9% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. In each of the past three years, we have also achieved annual revenue renewal rates in excess of 90%. (For information on annual revenue renewal rates, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Performance Indicators - Annual Revenue Renewal Rates.) No single customer accounted for more than 1% of revenues and our ten largest customers represented only 6% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The following charts illustrate our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 by segment, type and geography:
Business Segments
Our reportable segment structure is comprised of two segments: Science and Intellectual Property (“IP”). This structure enables a sharp focus on cross-selling opportunities within the markets we serve and provides substantial scale. Additional information with respect to business segment results is included in Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Segment Information.
Science Segment (58.2% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020)
Our Science segment consists of our Academic and Life Sciences Product Lines. Both provide curated, high-value, structured information that is delivered and embedded into the workflows of our customers, which include research intensive corporations, life science and healthcare organizations and universities world-wide.

Notable Products and Offerings | Web of ScienceInCitesScholarOne | Cortellis Drug Discovery Intelligence (formerly Integrity)Cortellis Generic Intelligence (formerly Newport)

Academic Product Line
Our Academic Product Line (“APL”) provides products and services to organizations that plan, fund, implement and utilize research. We deliver search and discovery services to researchers with proprietary scientific data; we help researchers cite their research with workflow tools; we provide data and analytics to allow for global measures of research excellence and university rankings; we support governments and policy makers worldwide in assessment programs; and we inform a wide range of sector specific consultation and reporting activities to national and institutional research agencies across the G20 countries. We believe that the high quality and unique nature of APL’s products and the informed approach of our professional service expertise have resulted in our information, services and workflow tools becoming embedded within the fabric of the research community. Key products include Web of Science, InCites, Journal Citation Reports, EndNote, ScholarOne, Converis, and Publons.
Web of Science (“WOS”), our flagship product, holds a unique and pivotal role in the infrastructure of R&D and is frequently utilized as a reference standard in the academic, institutional and corporate sectors. It provides publication records and essential metadata from trusted published assets and is linked and indexed together via over 1.9 billion tracked citations from over 176 million index records going back to 1900 within the core Web of Science, and back to 1864 in Zoological Record. A key metric we provide is the “Journal Impact Factor” (“JIF”), which we believe is the most influential and best-known research metric of the last 50 years. Its primary value is as a journal-level metric to assess what journals are the most impactful, but universities and research funders use JIF to inform their evaluation of research excellence when assessing faculty and selecting funding grantees. Researchers also rely on the JIF to identify top-tier journals where they should publish their content.
Example Use Cases
•A physics professor planning a research program and making a grant proposal accesses WOS to evaluate the current state of research in her discipline, identify emerging trends within highly regarded and relevant scientific journals and select a research topic, while the grant-making institutions will use WOS’s analytic tools to measure the professor’s credentials.
•A university provost interested in evaluating her university’s chemistry department accesses WOS and our analytical tool InCites to measure the strength of the university’s research output and benchmark it against comparable institutions and find the best researchers to bolster the university’s ranking and improve the caliber of research, and find highly cited researchers, departments and laboratories.
Life Sciences Product Line
Our Life Sciences Product Line (“LSPL”) provides products and services primarily to pharmaceutical, healthcare and biotechnology companies. These Product Lines help manage customer’s intellectual property throughout their product development lifecycle. We believe we provide a unique end-to-end proposition, which links to early research workflows, and believe there is an opportunity to stretch further into the approval and post-approval phases of drug development. Key products include Cortellis research Intelligence, Cortellis Generics Intelligence, and DRG.
Cortellis, our flagship LSPL product, is used by strategy, business development, drug development, medical affairs and clinical professionals at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to support research, market intelligence and competitive monitoring in connection with the development and commercialization of new drugs. Our customers use the database to access and evaluate scientific data, drug pipeline data, clinical trial information, drug monographs, pharmaceutical M&A data and regulatory information, all of which have been aggregated, curated and classified by our team of scientific experts who evaluate and select data for inclusion in the database from a wide array of sources. In addition, our team of experts creates high-value content from this data, such as analytics, abstracts, conference summaries and regulatory reports. As of December 31, 2020, our data included more than 80,000 drug program records and more than 435,000 clinical trial records.
Example Use Case
•An analyst at a pharmaceutical firm who is evaluating several potential R&D programs will access the Cortellis database to assess competitive products in the drug development pipeline, review clinical trial data, and summarize regulatory information.
Intellectual Property Segment (41.8% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020)
Our Intellectual Property segment consists of our Patent, Trademark, Domain and IP Management Product Lines. These Product Lines help manage customer’s end-to-end portfolio of intellectual property from patents to trademarks to corporate website domains.
Our product portfolio for our Intellectual Property segment is summarized below.

Product Line | Patents | Trademarks | Domains | IP 
Product Description | Used to search and analyze patents | Used to monitor trademarks on an ongoing basis | Used to register and manage portions of web domains | Used for renewal and validation of intellectual property rights on behalf of customers

Patents Product Line
Our Patents Product Line (“PPL”) enables customers to evaluate the novelty of potential new products, confirm freedom to operate with respect to their product design, help them secure patent protection, assess the competitive technology landscape and ensure that their products comply with required industry standards. We provide a range of analytics capabilities and data visualization tools to improve the efficiency and accuracy of IP-driven decisions. Key products include Derwent Innovation, Innography and IP Professional Services.
Derwent, our flagship PPL product, is used by R&D professionals and lawyers to monitor patent filings, search existing patents and analyze data to support R&D decision-making. It is a critical resource to help our customers secure patent protection and address litigation of patent infringement. The product is powered by Derwent World Patents Index, our proprietary database of over 93 million patent publications from 59 patent offices, which represented 90% of all patents published globally in 2020 and has been developed and curated for over 50 years. The database combines data science with our team of domain experts who correct, enrich and abstract over six million global patents per year in over 30 languages, as of December 31, 2020. We provide customers with easy-to-understand summaries of patent filings that are prepared by our domain experts, who index and translate the highly technical and intentionally obscure patent filings into understandable abstracts that provide insights into a patent’s novelty, use and advantage over prior patents.
Example Use Case
•An employee developing a new product or idea (e.g., a chemical engineer or a product designer) will access the Derwent database of patents to evaluate the novelty and determine the patentability of the new product or idea.
Trademarks Product Line
Our Trademarks Product Line (“TPL”) provides trademark research and protection services for businesses and law firms globally and relies on our leading trademark database, CompuMark. Our CompuMark’s offerings span the entire life cycle of a trademark, from determining availability of a proposed trademark to monitoring for infringement post registration. TPL provides global trademark research and protection to corporations and law firms globally. Over the last 30 years, the organization has curated content from more than 180 patent and trademark offices. Coupled with industry specific sources, 
including over 65 industrial design databases and 70 Pharma In-Use Databases, as of December 31, 2020, CompuMark delivers the most comprehensive data set available for trademark professionals.
Key products include trademark screening, trademark searching and trademark watching. We do this by (i) providing customers with sophisticated self-service tools to narrow large lists of potential trademarks, which we refer to as “screening”; (ii) preparing detailed, custom reports post screening that uncover potential risks related to a proposed trademark, which we refer to as “clearance searching”; and (iii) monitoring trademark applications and other data sources on a recurring subscription revenues basis to alert clients to potential instances of infringement post registration, which we refer to as “watching.”
Example Use Case
•An attorney for a large law firm helps clear a trademark for use by its corporate customer as part of a new product launch. The attorney first conducts a “knock-out” search as part of a preliminary screening process using our trademark research tool and then later orders an analyst curated “Full Search” report by CompuMark to ensure the availability of the proposed trademark in the markets in which the customer will be operating. In this way, the attorney can clear both the word and image mark for use by his/her client. The attorney will then subscribe to CompuMark’s trademark watching services to continually ensure that none of their customers’ valuable trademarks are being infringed upon.
Domains Product Line
Our Domains Product Line (“DPL”) helps global enterprises establish, manage, optimize and protect their online presence. Our primary offering, MarkMonitor, provides a suite of technology services for brand managers, IT managers, marketing teams, and legal counsel in corporations to register and manage portfolios of domain names critical for their business. This allows customers to achieve the right balance of being easily found online without overpaying for domains that generate little to no Internet user traffic. MarkMonitor also provides data and domain industry insights which help enterprises maximize the power of their portfolios, and mitigate cyber squatters’ attempts to register domains aimed to defraud consumers.
Example Use Case
•An in-house counsel uses MarkMonitor to ensure that important domain names are registered and protected from security threats such as domain hijacking, spam, and other forms of domain name system ("DNS") abuse.
IP Management Product Line
Our IP Management Product Line ("IPMPL") provides technology solutions and legal support services across the intellectual property lifecyle under the CPA Global brand name. The principal activities are renewal and validation of IP rights on behalf of customers and the development and provision of IP management software, as well as other activities including patent searching, IP filing, prosecution support and trademark watching.
Example Use Case
•A law firm partnership uses the technology solutions to provide renewal and validation of IP rights on behalf of a customer.
Our Strategy
The Clarivate management team, led by Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jerre Stead, has implemented a transformation strategy designed to improve operations, increase cash flow and accelerate revenues growth. Under Mr. Stead’s leadership, we have embarked on a race to deliver excellence to the markets we serve and continue our evolution as a world-class organization. As we move forward, the focus will be on three basic principles; focus, simplify and execute. This means:
1. Focusing on our core capabilities and the greatest opportunities for growth.
2. Simplifying our organization and processes. The focus on two segments is the driver for streamlining our operations.
3. Relentlessly driving execution of our strategy and growth plans.
These changes will help us operate with greater focus and urgency. They will ensure that we put our clients first, drive accountability throughout the organization, accelerate decision-making, and promote consistency. These tenets will enable us to deliver long-term, sustainable growth.
With a proven operational playbook with multiple levers, we have quickly pursued initiatives to set ourselves on a growth trajectory. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 are among the first proof points that our transformation is underway.

Operational Improvement Initiatives
We have implemented several cost-saving and margin improvement initiatives designed to generate substantial incremental cash flow. We have engaged a strategic consulting firm to assist us in optimizing our structure and cost base. The focus of these initiatives is to identify significant cost reductions to be implemented over the next several quarters, enabling us to deliver margins consistent with those of our peer group. Some examples include:
•decreasing costs by simplifying organizational structures and rationalizing general and administrative functions to enhance a customer-centric focus;
•using artificial intelligence and the latest technologies to reduce costs and increase efficiencies for content sourcing and curation;
•moving work performed by contractors in-house to best-cost geographic locations, particularly India, where we have significant scale that can be leveraged;
•achieving headcount productivity benchmarks and operational efficiency metrics based on alignment with quantified sector leader benchmarks;
•expanding existing operations in best-cost geographic locations, aligning with business objectives;
•minimizing our real estate footprint by reducing facility locations substantially over the next three years; and
•divesting non-core assets.
Revenues Growth Initiatives
We believe a significant opportunity exists for us to accelerate revenues growth by increasing the value of our products and services, developing new products, cross-selling certain products and optimizing sales force productivity. Actions to achieve such revenues growth are expected to include:
•developing new value-added products and services;
•delivering an enhanced client experience through ongoing renovations to our products’ user interface and user experience;
•offering additional analytics that enhance existing products and services;
•moving up the value chain by providing our clients with predictive and prescriptive analytics, allowing for stronger growth and higher retention rates;
•expanding our footprint with new and existing customers, with significant opportunity for growth in the Asia Pacific and emerging markets;
•broadening our consulting capabilities, in particular in the Science Group, where there is considerable opportunity for us to deliver high value consulting services to drive significant revenues growth;
•optimizing product pricing and packaging based on customer needs;
•increasing sales force focus on large accounts;
•expanding our inside sales capability to improve account coverage; and
•restructuring our incentive plans to drive new business, as well as cross-selling among similar products and overlapping buying centers.
The above actions are part of an overarching effort to improve retention rates and new business growth rates to best-in-class levels across our portfolio.
Pursue Acquisition Opportunities
Given the fragmented nature of the broader information services industry, we track and, where appropriate, will continue to pursue opportunities across our product lines. From 2017 through 2020, we completed seven small add-on acquisitions and two significant acquisitions to augment our existing portfolio of assets and provide additional datasets and services for our customers. Our completed acquisitions include Publons, Kopernio and Decision Resources Group within the Science segment and TrademarkVision, SequenceBase, Darts-ip, CPA Global, Beijing IncoPat and Hanlim in the IP segment. We also acquired the assets of CustomersFirst Now, which was accounted for as an asset acquisition. Certain of these acquisitions are fully integrated into our platform, while others continue to be integrated, and we believe they have already provided additional value to our customers. Additionally, we divested lower margin, non-core products lines such as MarkMonitor Brand Protection, Antipiracy and Antifraud solutions, and Techstreet.
We are evaluating additional acquisition opportunities to supplement our existing platform and enable us to enter new markets. Our focus is on disciplined and accretive investments that leverage our core strengths and enhance our current product, market, geographic and customer strategies. We believe that the combination of Mr. Stead’s successful acquisition track record and our scale and status as a global information services leader uniquely positions us to create value through additional acquisitions.
Positive Sector Dynamics Support Our Trajectory
We operate in the global information services and analytics sector, which is experiencing robust growth due to many factors. Data and analytics have become critical inputs into broader corporate decision-making in today’s marketplace, and companies and institutions are seeking services like ours to enhance the predictive nature of their analysis. In addition to creating greater demand for our services, rapid innovation within our customers’ businesses has created new use cases for our services. Third-party industry reports estimate the global data and analytics market will grow from $169 billion in 2018 
to $274 billion by 2022, a 13.2% compound annual growth rate over the period. This represents the target addressable market across verticals that have a need for data and analytical services.
Customers of data and analytics products continue to approach complex business decisions in new ways. We believe that these customers are placing greater emphasis and value on the ability to embed predictive and prescriptive analytics into their decision-making processes. These customers are using smart data to anticipate what will happen in the future, as opposed to using historical data to study what has happened in the past. As such, we are investing in these critical, forward-facing products and solutions. We believe offering these types of products will increase the value clients place on our products, allow for stronger growth and open new addressable markets, as illustrated below.
Significant Move Up the Value Chain with Smart Data Offerings
Our Competitive Strengths
Leading Market Positions in Attractive and Growing Global Markets
We offer a collection of high-quality, market-leading information and analytic products and solutions serving the intellectual property, scientific research and life sciences end-markets. Through our products and services, we address the large and growing demand from corporations, government agencies, universities, law firms and other professional services organizations worldwide for comprehensive, industry-specific content and analytical tools to facilitate the discovery, development, protection, commercialization and measurement of scientific research, innovations and brands. We believe that our flagship products hold a #1 or #2 position by revenue across the respective markets they serve, including abstracting and indexing databases, life science regulatory and competitive intelligence and intellectual property protection (including patent, trademarks and brand protection). We also believe that the outlook for growth in each of our Product Lines is compelling because of customer demand for curated high-quality data, underpinned by favorable end-market trends, such as rising global R&D spending, growing demand for information services in emerging markets, the acceleration of e-commerce and the increasing number of patent and trademark applications.
A Trusted Partner Delivering Highly Curated Content Embedded Within Customer Workflows
We believe the substantial increase in unstructured data over the last decade has increased the importance of our proprietary, curated databases to our customers. This trend has resulted in a critical need for unstructured data to be meaningfully filtered, analyzed and curated into relevant information that facilitates key operational and strategic decisions made by businesses, academic institutions and governments worldwide. Our suite of branded information and analytic solutions provides access to content that has been collected, curated and standardized over decades, making our products and services highly valued and increasingly important for our customers. Our content curation and editorial teams include over 930 employees who clean, analyze and classify unstructured data to ensure high-quality content and an enhanced user experience. We believe our solutions and commitment to excellence provide us with a significant advantage in both retaining existing and attracting new customers.
Attractive Business Model with Strong Free Cash Flow Profile
Approximately 67.9% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were generated through annual or multi-year subscription agreements. Approximately 9.0% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were generated through re-occurring transactional revenues. In addition, we have been able to achieve annual revenues renewal rates in excess of 90% over the past three years. We believe our business has strong and attractive free cash flow characteristics due to our highly visible and recurring subscription revenues stream, attractive Adjusted EBITDA margins, low capital expenditure requirements and favorable net working capital characteristics. Anticipated revenue growth, margin improvement and effective working capital management are expected to result in strong free cash flow generation. We believe this will create capacity to invest further into the business so that we can grow and maximize shareholder returns.
Diversified Product Lines with Longstanding Customer Relationships
We believe that the diversified nature of our Product Lines enhances the stability of our entire platform as we are not dependent on any one end-market, product, service or customer. We serve a large, diverse and global customer base, and as of December 31, 2020, we served over 30,000 customers in more than 170 countries, including the top 30 pharmaceutical companies by revenues. No single customer accounted for more than 1% of revenues and our ten largest customers represented only 6% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe the strong value proposition offered by our content, combined with the integration of our products and services into our customers’ daily workflows and decision-making processes, leads to substantial customer loyalty. Our relationships with our top 50 customers by revenues have an average lifespan of over 15 years. Our diverse global footprint is highlighted by the distribution of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 by geography: Americas (49.4%), Europe/Middle East/Africa (28.6%), and Asia Pacific (21.9%).
Resilience Through Economic Cycles
We believe our business is resilient across economic cycles because our products and services are an integral part of our customers’ decision-making processes. We believe multi-year agreements also help to maintain this resiliency. During the economic downturn of 2008 to 2009, three of our key products — Web of Science, Cortellis and Derwent — realized year-over-year revenues increases. In addition, our diverse global footprint reduces our exposure to national and regional economic downturns.
Our performance is largely due to the sectors we serve and the deep integration of our products with our customers’ workflows, which provides for a resilient business model even during an economic downturn.
Proven and Experienced Leadership
Mr. Stead is a proven business operator with demonstrated success in shareholder value creation. At Clarivate, Mr. Stead brings his decades of expertise in the information services sector to guide a talented and experienced management team sourced from world-class, global companies, most of whom have decades of experience in their respective areas of expertise.
Background and History
Clarivate Plc was registered on January 7, 2019 and is organized under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands. Our registered office is located at 4th Floor, St Paul’s Gate, 22-24 New Street, St. Helier, Jersey JE1 4TR. Our principal business offices 
are located at 70 St. Mary Axe, London EC3A 8BE, United Kingdom, where our main telephone number is +44 207 4334000. We maintain a website at www.clarivate.com. In addition, the SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers (including Clarivate) that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.
Our predecessors date back to the acquisition of two industry-leading information services businesses: Derwent World Patents Index (“DWPI”) and Institute for Scientific Information (“ISI”). DWPI was founded in 1951 by Monte Hyams who first began abstracting and publishing British patents on a weekly basis. This platform was then launched as the first online patent search tool in 1974. ISI was founded in 1957 by Dr. Eugene Garfield as a series of databases which laid the foundation for modern day bibliometrics and the influential Journal Impact Factor indicator. Thomson Reuters acquired DWPI in 1984 and ISI in 1992; it made further investments in complementary businesses centered on life science research and domain management.
Since Thomson Reuters acquired DWPI and ISI, the business now known as Clarivate has emerged as the leading global information services and analytics company serving the scientific research, intellectual property and life sciences end-markets. Through product development, investment and acquisitions, we have developed a full suite of solutions providing high-value structured information that facilitates the discovery, protection and commercialization of scientific research, innovations and brands.
During the majority of its time under prior ownership, the Company operated as a set of non-core, separate divisions until Thomson Reuters decided in 2015 to divest them. This decision led to two key transformative events.
The first transformative event occurred in October 2016, when Onex and Baring acquired subsidiaries and assets comprising the intellectual property and science business of Thomson Reuters for $3,566,599 and formed Clarivate.
Onex, Baring and the new executive team they put in place focused on transitioning us to be a standalone company and completed a substantial number of operational improvements, including:
•building a new senior executive management team;
•investing in our core products to upgrade their content, functionality, analytical tools and user interfaces;
•completing the acquisitions of Publons, Kopernio, TrademarkVision, and SequenceBase to complement our product offerings;
•implementing initial cost savings initiatives; and
•fully transitioning the business from reliance on Thomson Reuters.
The second transformative event occurred in January 2019, when Churchill Capital Corp, a special purpose acquisition company led by Mr. Stead, announced that it would combine with Clarivate in a transaction completed in May 2019. Following the merger, the ordinary shares of Clarivate began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and NYSE American. Clarivate shares now trade on the NYSE under the symbol “CLVT”.
Recent Developments 
Strategic Acquisitions
Acquisition of CPA Global
On October 1, 2020, we acquired 100% of the assets, liabilities and equity interests of CPA Global, a global leader in intellectual property software and tech-enabled services. Clarivate acquired all of the outstanding shares of CPA Global in a cash and stock transaction. The aggregate consideration in connection with the closing of the CPA Global acquisition was $8,541,551, net of $102,010 cash acquired, including an equity hold back consideration of $46,485. The aggregate consideration was composed of (i) $6,565,477 from the issuance of up to 218,183,778 ordinary shares to Redtop Holdings Limited, a portfolio company of Leonard Green & Partners, L.P., representing approximately 35% pro forma fully diluted ownership of Clarivate and (ii) approximately $2,078,084 in cash to fund the repayment of CPA Global's parent company outstanding debt of $2,055,822 and related interest swap termination fee of $22,262. Of the 218,306,663 ordinary shares issuable in the acquisition, Clarivate issued 210,357,918 ordinary shares as of October 1, 2020. In addition, 6,325,860 shares were issued to Leonard Green & Partners, L.P. to fund a Employee Benefit Trust established for the CPA Equity Plan. These shares should have been excluded from purchase price consideration.
In conjunction with the closing of the transaction, the Company incurred an incremental $1,600,000 of term loans under our term loan facility and used the net proceeds from such borrowings, together with cash on hand, to fund the transaction. As a result of the additional term loan associated with the CPA Global acquisition, we had $2,847,400 outstanding on our term loan facility as of December 31, 2020. 
Acquisition of Decision Resources Group 
On February 28, 2020, we acquired 100% of the assets, liabilities and equity interests of Decision Resources Group ("DRG"), a premier provider of high-value data, analytics and insights products and services to the healthcare industry, from Piramal Enterprises Limited ("PEL"), which is a part of global business conglomerate Piramal Group. The acquisition helps us expand our core businesses and provides us with the potential to grow in the Life Sciences Product Line.
The aggregate consideration paid in connection with the closing of the DRG acquisition was $964,997, composed of $900,000 of base cash plus $6,100 of adjusted closing cash paid on the closing date and up to 2,895,638 of the Company's ordinary shares to be issued to PEL following the one-year anniversary of closing. The contingent stock consideration was valued at $58,897 on the closing date and will be revalued at each period end and included in the Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

On February 20, 2020, we announced the redemption of all of our outstanding public warrants to purchase our ordinary shares that were issued as part of the units sold in the Churchill Capital Corp initial public offering and remained outstanding at 5:00 p.m. New York City time on March 23, 2020, for a redemption price of $0.01 per public warrant. In addition, our board of directors elected that, upon delivery of the notice of the redemption on February 20, 2020, all public warrants were to be exercised only on a “cashless basis.” Accordingly, by virtue of the cashless exercise of public warrants, exercising public warrant holders received 0.4626 of an ordinary share for each public warrant, and 4,747,432 ordinary shares were issued for public warrants exercised on a cashless basis and 4,649 public warrants were redeemed for $0.01 per public warrant. As of December 31, 2020, no public warrants were outstanding.
The Private Placement Warrants issued in a private placement concurrently with the Churchill Capital Corp initial public offering and still held by their initial holders were not subject to this redemption.
Dispositions
Disposition of Techstreet 
On November 6, 2020, the Company completed the sale of certain assets and liabilities of non-core assets and liabilities within the IP segment for a total purchase price of $42,832. A gain of $28,140 was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2020.
MarkMonitor Brand Protection, Antipiracy and Antifraud Disposition 
In November 2019, we announced an agreement to sell the MarkMonitor brand protection, antipiracy and antifraud businesses, and completed such divestiture on January 1, 2020. We retained the MarkMonitor Domain Management business.
Customers
We serve a large, diverse and global customer base and, as of December 31, 2020, we served over 30,000 customers in more than 170 countries as well as the top 30 pharmaceutical companies by revenue. Our customers either use our databases on an exclusive basis or on a dual-sourced basis.
No single customer accounted for more than 1% of revenues and our ten largest customers represented only 6%, 5% and 6% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 respectively.
Competitive Environment
We believe the principal competitive factors in our business include the quality of content embedded in our databases and those of our competitors, customers’ perception of our products relative to the value that they deliver, user interface of the products and the quality and breadth of our overall offerings. We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors.
We believe no single competitor currently offers the same scope of services and market coverage we provide, nor do we provide the same scope of services and market coverage as our competitors. The breadth of markets we serve exposes us to a broad range of competitors as described below.
Our primary competitors differ by product line and include the following companies and product offerings:
•Abstracting and Indexing Database Market: Elsevier (Scopus, SciVal), Digital Science (Dimensions) and ProQuest (RefWorks);
•Patent Protection Market: LexisNexis (TotalPatent), Minesoft (PatBase) and Questel (Orbit);
•Life Sciences Regulatory and Competitive Intelligence Market: Evaluate (Evaluate Pharma), Global Data (Global Data Pharmaceuticals), Informa (Pharma Intelligence, BioMedTracker, Pharmaprojects, Trialtrove, Sitetrove), IQVIA (Tarius) and Qiagen (Qiagen Services);
•Trademark Protection Market: Corsearch (Contour, Corsearch Screening, search and watch services), and Markify (ComprehensiveSearch, ProSearch and trademark and domain watch); and
•Domain Management Market: Corporation Service Company ("CSC") (domain name management) and AppDetex (domain management and online brand protection).
Sources of Data
The data supporting our products and services is sourced principally through two different types of arrangements. First, we source data generally at little or no cost from public sources, including federal, state and local governments. Second, we purchase data from third-party data aggregators under contracts that reflect prevailing market pricing for the data elements purchased.
Technology
Our information technology systems are fundamental to our success. They are used for the storage, processing, access and delivery of the data which forms the foundation of our business and the development and delivery of our solutions provided to our customers.
Much of the technology we use and provide to our customers is developed, maintained and supported by approximately 1,226 employees and approximately 669 contractors, as of December 31, 2020. We generally own or have secured ongoing rights to use for the purposes of our business all the customer-facing applications which are material to our operations.
We are continually transforming our content, products, services and company to better meet our customers’ needs. We also are focused on securing our customer data and global systems as we implement and enhance our security programs. We are migrating the infrastructure for several of our customer applications and content databases to a third-party service provider, which provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a “cloud” computing service.
Intellectual Property
As of December 31, 2020, we owned approximately 1,404 registered trademarks, 175 trademark applications, 3,984 domain names, 145 granted patents and 56 patent applications. We also own certain proprietary software. In addition, we are licensed to use certain third-party software, and obtain significant content and data through third-party licensing arrangements with content providers. We consider our trademarks, service marks, databases, software and other IP to be proprietary, and we rely on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark, trade secret and patent), contractual and technical safeguards to protect our IP rights. We believe that the IP we own and license is sufficient to permit us to carry on our business as presently conducted.
Our agreements with our customers and business partners place certain restrictions on the use of our IP. As a general practice, employees, contractors and other parties with access to our proprietary information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our IP and confidential information.
New Product Development
We believe that innovation is essential to our success and is one of our primary bases of competition. We believe we are uniquely positioned to help shape how professionals find, evaluate, interact with, consume and act upon information. We are focused on developing capabilities to improve our products’ user interfaces, analytical tools, searching algorithms and content curation processes. Our current focus includes building out a technology platform focused on search technologies, big data and analytics, machine learning, social computing and natural language technologies. This will enable more rapid product development as we shift our investment focus toward new products rather than maintenance of legacy technology.
We also add to our business line offerings through acquisitions. We have completed two significant acquisitions in 2020 including DRG, expanding upon our life sciences product line and CPA Global, broadening our IP product offerings. During the past four years we have completed small add-on acquisitions to augment our existing portfolio of assets and provide additional datasets and services for our customers. Given the fragmented nature of the broader information services industry, we track and, where appropriate, have pursued opportunities across our Product Lines. These include Publons and Kopernio in APL, SequenceBase in PPL, Connect in CPA Global and TrademarkVision and Darts-ip in Trademark Product Line. These acquisitions are fully integrated into our platform and we believe they have already provided additional value to our customers.
When we find it advantageous, we augment our proprietary data sources and systems by forming alliances with other leading information providers and technology companies and integrating their product offerings into our offerings. This approach gives our customers the opportunity to obtain the information they need from a single source and more easily integrate the information into their workflows.
Enforcement of Civil Liabilities
U.S. laws do not necessarily extend either to us or our officers or directors. We are incorporated under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands. Some of our directors and officers reside outside of the United States. Substantially all of our assets and the assets of our directors and officers are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to 
effect service of process on either us or our officers and directors within the United States, or to enforce against these persons or us, either inside or outside the United States, a judgment obtained in a U.S. court predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities or other laws of the United States or any U.S. state.
We have appointed Vistra USA, LLC, as our agent to receive service of process with respect to any action brought against us in the United States under the federal securities laws of the United States or of the laws of any state of the United States.
A judgment of a U.S. court is not directly enforceable in Jersey, but constitutes a cause of action which may be enforced by Jersey courts provided that:
•the applicable U.S. courts had jurisdiction over the case, as recognized under Jersey law;
•the judgment is given on the merits and is final, conclusive and non-appealable;
•the judgment relates to the payment of a sum of money, not being taxes, fines or similar governmental penalties;
•the defendant is not immune under the principles of public international law;
•the same matters at issue in the case were not previously the subject of a judgment or disposition in a separate court;
•the judgment was not obtained by fraud; and
•the recognition and enforcement of the judgment is not contrary to public policy in Jersey.
Jersey courts award compensation for the loss or damage actually sustained by the plaintiff. Although punitive damages are generally unknown to the Jersey legal system, there is no prohibition on them either by statute or customary law. Whether a particular judgment may be deemed contrary to Jersey public policy depends on the facts of each case, though judgments found to be exorbitant, unconscionable, or excessive will generally be deemed as contrary to public policy. Moreover, certain defendants may qualify for protection under Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980, an act of the UK extended to Jersey by the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (Jersey) Order, 1983. This Act provides that a qualifying defendant is not liable for multiple damages, in excess of that required for actual compensation. A “qualifying defendant” for these purposes is a citizen of the UK and its Colonies (as defined in the Act), a corporation or other limited liability entity organized under the laws of the UK, Jersey or other territory for whose international relations the UK is responsible or a person conducting business in Jersey.
Jersey courts cannot enter into the merits of the foreign judgment and cannot act as a court of appeal or review over the foreign courts. It is doubtful that an original action based on U.S. federal or state securities laws could be brought before Jersey courts. In addition, a plaintiff who is not resident in Jersey may be required to provide a security bond in advance to cover the potential of the expected costs of any case initiated in Jersey. In addition, Clarivate has been further advised by our legal counsel in Jersey that it is uncertain as to whether the courts of Jersey would entertain original actions or enforce judgments from U.S. courts against us or our officers and directors which originated from actions alleging civil liability under U.S. federal or state securities laws.
Marketing, Sales and Customer Support
We primarily sell our products and services directly to our customers, although some of our products and services are sold through partners. Focusing some of our sales and marketing efforts on digital sales and marketing has allowed us to broaden our range of customers and reduce sales and marketing costs. We have a dedicated sales and marketing force, which, as of December 31, 2020, consisted of approximately 1,469 people.
We annually develop sales, distribution and marketing strategies on a product-by-product and service-by-service basis. We leverage customer data, business and market intelligence and competitive profiling to retain customers and cross-sell products and services, while also working to promote unified brand recognition across all our products and services.
Our sales teams participate in both service and sales activities. They provide direct support, interacting frequently with assigned customers to assure a positive experience using our products and services. Sales people primarily seek out new sales opportunities, including existing customer retention and upsell, and work with the various sales teams to coordinate sales activity and provide the best solutions for our customers. A portion of our sales people’s compensation is tied to revenues retention. We believe our sales people’s product knowledge and local presence differentiates us from our competition.
In addition, we employ product specialists who are subject-matter experts and work with sales people on specific opportunities for their assigned products. Both sales people and product specialists have responsibility for identifying new sales opportunities. A team approach and a common customer relationship management system allow for effective coordination between the two groups.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, approximately 8,445 full-time and approximately 245 part-time employees support our business operations. The employee count excludes employees related to the MarkMonitor Brand Protection, Antipiracy and Antifraud disposition in January 2020 and the Techstreet Disposition in November 2020. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations for information related to the disposition. None of our employees in the United States are represented by unions; however, customary representation by unions and works councils applies for certain of our non-U.S. employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions to operations due to labor disagreements.
The Company has spent the past two years fostering a values-led culture that begins with the Company’s purpose and vision that human ingenuity can transform the world and we will improve the way the world creates, protects and advances innovation. With a continuous focus on three corporate values (aim for greatness, value every voice and own your actions) along with transparent communication and a wide variety of colleague support programs, colleague engagement has steadily climbed and reached 79 (out of 100) in September 2020.
We provide a variety of benefits to promote retention and growth of our employees. We strive to offer equitable pay and competitive salaries and wages. In addition, we have historically provided an annual broad-based equity grant to our employees to promote a sense of company pride and ownership. We offer a comprehensive benefits package that gives a robust collection of rewards and benefits, including healthcare and insurance benefits, and retirement savings plans. We also host a number of affinity groups for our employees. We have an online academy that fosters a learning culture, leveraging the knowledge and expertise of our people. 
Seasonality
Our cash flows from operations are generated primarily from payments from our subscription customers and the standard term of a subscription is typically 12 months. When a customer enters into a new subscription agreement, or submits a notice to renew their subscription, we typically invoice for the full amount of the subscription period, record the balance to deferred revenues and ratably recognize the deferral throughout the subscription period. As a result, we experience cash flow seasonality throughout the year, with a heavier weighting of operating cash inflows occurring during the first half, and particularly first quarter, of the year, when most subscription invoices are sent, as compared to the second half of the year.
Regulatory Environment
Certain of our Product Lines provide authorized customers with products and services such as access to public records. Our Product Lines that provide such products and services are subject to applicable privacy and consumer information laws and regulations, including U.S. federal and state and European Union (the “EU”) and member state regulation. Our compliance obligations vary from regulator to regulator, and may include, among other things, strict data security programs, submissions of regulatory reports, providing consumers with certain notices and correcting inaccuracies in applicable reports. Many of these laws and regulations are complex and their application to us, our customers or the specific services and relationships we have with our customers are not always clear. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or any failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and otherwise negatively affect our business. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information about the impact of government regulation on our company.
Sustainability and Environment, Social and Governance (“ESG”) 
Recognizing that sustainability and ESG are critical to the Company’s future success, a formal ESG commitment was launched in 2020. Built around four ESG pillars (i.e., governance, environment, colleagues and community) and aligned to 
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, our goal is to embed sustainability into the fiber and operations of the company and further strengthen the values-led company culture. 
The four ESG pillars of Sustainability@Clarivate
During the many challenges posed by the uncertainty of the global pandemic, Sustainability@Clarivate achieved a number of important initial milestones, primarily around reporting, organizational infrastructure and governance deliverables. 
The below describes the actions taken by the Company to ensure a focus on sustainability:
•Assessed, developed and launched Sustainability@Clarivate framework and strategy, including a dedicated sustainability office and team, a sustainability steering committee, a sustainability champions network, and a comprehensive scorecard of goals across all dimensions;
•Signatory to the United Nations Women's Empowerment Principles ("WEPs"), the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion and the Stonewall Transgender Rights are Human Rights; 
•Launched an advanced privacy center and expanded ESG information sharing to increase transparency and commitment to annual goal setting;
•Implemented a global e-waste program and launched an R2 compliant e-waste recycling effort across our global operations;
•Implemented a third party environmental metrics system to collect and analyze data in order to optimize our real estate portfolio;
•Initiated efforts to build a more sustainable supply chain by evaluating our top 100 suppliers against a comprehensive ESG evaluation framework; and 
•Earned Ecovadis Bronze Level and Gold Level recognition with our Proctor & Gamble ESG evaluation
