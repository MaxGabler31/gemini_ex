ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
 
See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of our business.
 
Regulation and Laws 
 
The coal mining industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities on matters such as:
 

● | employee health and safety; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | mine permits and other licensing requirements; 
● | air quality standards; 
● | water quality standards; 
● | storage of petroleum products and substances that are regarded as hazardous under applicable laws or that, if spilled, could reach waterways or wetlands; 
● | plant and wildlife protection that could limit or prohibit mining or exploration; 
● | restricting the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment in the performance of mining or exploration and production activities;
● | discharge of materials; 
● | storage and handling of explosives; 
● | wetlands protection; 
● | surface subsidence from underground mining; and 
● | the effects, if any, that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. 

 
Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties, the imposition of strict, joint and several liability, investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of the operations on our properties. The regulatory burden on fossil fuel industries increases the cost of doing business and consequently affects profitability. The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly obligations could increase our or our mineral interest operators’ costs and adversely affect our performance.  In addition, the utility industry is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities, which has adversely affected demand for coal. It is possible that new legislation or regulations may be adopted, or that existing laws or regulations may be interpreted differently or more stringently enforced, any of which could have a significant impact on our mining operations or our customers’ ability to use coal. For more information, please see risk factors described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” below.
 
We are committed to conducting mining operations in compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. However, because of the extensive and detailed nature of these regulatory requirements, particularly the regulatory system of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) where citations can be issued without regard to fault, and many of the standards include subjective elements, it is not reasonable to expect any coal mining company to be free of citations. When we receive a citation, we attempt to remediate any identified condition immediately. While we have not quantified all of the costs of compliance with applicable federal and state laws and associated regulations, those costs have been and are expected to continue to be significant. Compliance with these laws and regulations has substantially increased the cost of coal mining for domestic coal producers.
 
Expenditures for environmental matters have not been material in recent years. We have accrued for the present value of the estimated cost of asset retirement obligations and mine closings, including the cost of treating mine water discharge, when necessary. The accruals for asset retirement obligations and mine closing costs are based upon permit requirements and the estimated costs and timing of asset retirement obligations and mine closing procedures. Although management believes it has made adequate provisions for all expected reclamation and other costs associated with mine closures, future operating results would be adversely affected if these accruals were insufficient.

Mining Permits and Approvals 
 
Numerous governmental permits or approvals are required for mining operations. Applications for permits require extensive engineering and data analysis and presentation and must address a variety of environmental, health and safety matters associated with a proposed mining operation. These matters include the manner and sequencing of coal extraction, the storage, use and disposal of waste and other substances and impacts on the environment, the construction of water containment areas, and reclamation of the area after coal extraction. Meeting all requirements imposed by any of these authorities may be costly and may delay or prevent commencement or continuation of mining operations.
 
The permitting process for certain mining operations can extend over several years and can be subject to administrative and judicial challenge, including by the public. Some required mining permits are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain in a timely manner, or at all. We cannot assure you that we will not experience difficulty or delays in obtaining mining permits in the future or that a current permit will not be revoked.
 
We are required to post bonds to secure performance under our permits. Under some circumstances, substantial fines and penalties, including revocation of mining permits, may be imposed under the laws and regulations described above. Monetary sanctions and, in severe circumstances, criminal sanctions may be imposed for failure to comply with these laws and regulations. Regulations also provide that a mining permit can be refused or revoked if the permit applicant or permittee owns or controls, directly or indirectly through other entities, mining operations that have outstanding environmental violations. Although like other coal companies, we have been cited for violations in the ordinary course of our business, we have never had a permit suspended or revoked because of any violation, and the penalties assessed for these violations have not been material.
 
Mine Health and Safety Laws 
 
The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (“FMSHA”) and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, imposes extensive and detailed safety and health standards on numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, blasting, the equipment used in mining operations, and numerous other matters. MSHA monitors and rigorously enforces compliance with these federal laws and regulations. In addition, the states where we operate have state programs for mine safety and health regulation and enforcement. Federal and state safety and health regulations affecting the coal mining industry are perhaps the most comprehensive and rigorous system in the United States for the protection of employee safety and have a significant effect on our operating costs. Although many of the requirements primarily impact underground mining, our competitors in all of the areas in which we operate are subject to the same laws and regulations.
 
FMSHA has been construed as authorizing MSHA to issue citations and orders pursuant to the legal doctrine of strict liability or liability without fault, and FMSHA requires the imposition of a civil penalty for each cited violation. Negligence and gravity assessments, along with other factors can result in the issuance of various types of orders, including orders requiring withdrawal from the mine or the affected area, and some orders can also result in the imposition of civil penalties. FMSHA also contains criminal liability provisions. For example, criminal liability may be imposed upon corporate operators who knowingly and willfully authorize, order or carry out violations of the FMSHA or its mandatory health and safety standards.
 
The Federal Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (“MINER Act”) significantly amended the FMSHA, imposing more extensive and stringent compliance standards, increasing criminal penalties and establishing a maximum civil penalty for non-compliance, and expanding the scope of federal oversight, inspection, and enforcement activities. Following the passage of the MINER Act, MSHA has issued new or more stringent rules and policies on a variety of topics, including:
 

● | sealing off abandoned areas of underground coal mines; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | mine safety equipment, training, and emergency reporting requirements; 
● | substantially increased civil penalties for regulatory violations; 
● | training and availability of mine rescue teams; 
● | underground “refuge alternatives” capable of sustaining trapped miners in the event of an emergency; 
● | flame-resistant conveyor belts, fire prevention and detection, and use of air from the belt entry; and
● | post-accident two-way communications and electronic tracking systems.

MSHA continues to interpret and implement various provisions of the MINER Act, along with introducing new proposed regulations and standards.
 
In 2014, MSHA began implementation of a finalized new regulation titled “Lowering Miner’s Exposure to Respirable Coal Mine Dust, Including Continuous Personal Dust Monitors.”  The final rule implemented a reduction in the allowable respirable coal mine dust exposure limits, requires the use of sampling data taken from a single sample rather than an average of samples, and increases oversight by MSHA regarding coal mine dust and ventilation issues at each mine, including the approval process for ventilation plans at each mine, all of which increase mining costs. The second phase of the rule began in February 2016 and requires additional sampling for designated and other occupations using the new continuous personal dust monitor technology, which provides real-time dust exposure information to the miner. Phase three of the rule began in August 2016 and resulted in lowering the current respirable dust level of 2.0 milligrams per cubic meter to 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter of air. Compliance with these rules can result in increased costs on our operations, including, but not limited to, the purchasing of new equipment and the hiring of additional personnel to assist with monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations. MSHA has published a request for information regarding engineering controls and best practices to lower miners’ exposure to respirable coal mine dust, which is currently set to close on July 9, 2022. It is uncertain whether MSHA will present additional proposed rules, or revisions to the final rule, following the closing of the comment period for the current request for information.
 
MSHA has also published, and may continue to publish, various proposed rules or requests for information, which may result in additional rulemakings. For example, in June 2016, MSHA published a request for information on Exposure of Underground Miners to Diesel Exhaust. Following a comment period that closed in November 2016, MSHA received requests for MSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to hold a Diesel Exhaust Partnership to address the issues covered by MSHA's request for information. The comment period for the request for information closed in September 2020.
 
Separately, in November 2020, MSHA published a proposed rule to revise Testing, Evaluation, and Approval of Electric Motor-Driven Mine Equipment and Accessories within underground mining environments. The comment period for the proposed rule closed in December 2020. It is uncertain whether MSHA will present a final rule addressing this issue.
 
Then, in September 2021, MSHA published a proposed rule requiring that mine operators employing six or more miners develop and implement a written safety program for mobile and powered haulage equipment at surface mines and surface areas of underground mines (Safety Program for Surface Mobile Equipment). The comment period for the proposed rule closed in November 2021. However, MHSA reopened the rulemaking record for additional public comments. A virtual hearing was held in January 2022, and the comment period closed in February 2022.
 
It is uncertain whether MSHA will present a final rule addressing any of the above issues or any of the other various proposed rules or requests for information or whether any such rule would have material impacts on our operations or our costs of operation.
 
Subsequent to the passage of the MINER Act, Illinois, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia have enacted legislation addressing issues such as mine safety and accident reporting, increased civil and criminal penalties, and increased inspections and oversight. Additionally, state administrative agencies can promulgate administrative rules and regulations affecting our operations. Other states may pass similar legislation or administrative regulations in the future.
 
Some of the costs of complying with existing regulations and implementing new safety and health regulations may be passed on to our customers. Although we have not quantified the full impact, implementing and complying with these new federal and state safety laws and regulations have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.
 
Black Lung Benefits Act 
 
The Black Lung Benefits Act of 1977 and the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, as amended in 1981 (“BLBA”), requires businesses that conduct current mining operations to make payments of black lung benefits to current and former coal miners with black lung disease, to some survivors of a miner who dies from this disease, and to a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses where no responsible coal mine operator has been identified for claims.  Effective January 1, 2019, the trust fund was funded by an excise tax on production of up to $0.50 per ton for underground-mined coal and up to $0.25 per ton for surface-mined coal, but not to exceed 2% of the applicable sales price. Effective January 1, 2020, the trust fund was funded by an excise tax on coal sold of up to $1.10 per ton for deep-mined coal and up to $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal, neither amount to exceed 4.4% of the gross sales price. Effective January 1, 2022, the trust fund is funded by an excise tax on production of up to $0.50 per ton for underground-mined coal and up to $0.25 per ton for surface-mined coal, but not to exceed 2% of the applicable sales price. It is uncertain whether the excise tax rates will be adjusted in the future or whether any such modifications would be retroactive.

Workers' Compensation and Black Lung
 
We provide income replacement and medical treatment for work-related traumatic injury claims as required by applicable state laws. Workers’ compensation laws also compensate survivors of workers who suffer employment-related deaths. We generally self-insure this potential expense using our actuary estimates of the cost of present and future claims. In addition, coal mining companies are subject to federal legislation and various state statutes for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible recipients related to coal workers' pneumoconiosis or black lung. We also provide for these claims through self-insurance programs. Our actuarial calculations are based on numerous assumptions, including disability incidence, medical costs, mortality, death benefits, dependents and discount rates.
 
The revised BLBA regulations took effect in January 2001, relaxing the stringent award criteria established under previous regulations and thus potentially allowing new federal claims to be awarded and allowing previously denied claimants to re-file under the revised criteria. These regulations may also increase black lung-related medical costs by broadening the scope of conditions for which medical costs are reimbursable and increase legal costs by shifting more of the burden of proof to the employer.
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010 includes significant changes to the federal black lung program retroactive to 2005, including an automatic survivor benefit paid upon the death of a miner with an awarded black lung claim and establishes a rebuttable presumption with regard to pneumoconiosis among miners with 15 or more years of coal mine employment that are totally disabled by a respiratory condition. These changes could have a material impact on our costs expended in association with the federal black lung program.
 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act 
 
The Federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (“SMCRA”) and similar state statutes establish operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as many aspects of underground mining. Currently, ~98% of our production capacity involves underground room and pillar mining (no surface subsidence), and ~2% involves surface mining. We do not engage in either mountain top removal or long-wall mining. SMCRA nevertheless requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of and upon completion of our mining activities.
 
SMCRA and similar state statutes require, among other things, that surface disturbance be restored in accordance with specified standards and approved reclamation plans. SMCRA requires us to restore affected surface areas to approximate the original contours as contemporaneously as practicable with the completion of surface mining operations. Federal law and some states impose on mine operators the responsibility for replacing certain water supplies damaged by mining operations and repairing or compensating for damage to certain structures occurring on the surface as a result of mine subsidence, a consequence of longwall mining and possibly other mining operations. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations relating to reclamation.
 
In addition, the Abandoned Mine Lands Program, which is part of SMCRA, imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are used to restore mines closed before 1977.  The fee expired on September 30, 2021, and was reauthorized through September 30, 2034, under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which was signed on November 15, 2021. The fee, as reauthorized, for surface-mined and underground-mined coal is $0.224 per ton and $0.096 per ton, respectively, through September 30, 2034. We have accrued the estimated costs of reclamation and mine closing, including the cost of treating mine water discharge when necessary.  In addition, states from time to time have increased and may continue to increase their fees and taxes to fund reclamation or orphaned mine sites and acid mine drainage control on a statewide basis.
 
Under SMCRA, responsibility for unabated violations, unpaid civil penalties and unpaid reclamation fees of independent contract mine operators and other third parties can be imputed to other companies that are deemed, according to the regulations, to have “owned” or “controlled” the third-party violator. Sanctions against the “owner” or “controller” are quite severe and can include being blocked from receiving new permits and having any permits revoked that were issued after the time of the violations or after the time civil penalties or reclamation fees became due. We are not aware of any currently pending or asserted claims against us relating to the “ownership” or “control” theories discussed above. However, we cannot assure you that such claims will not be asserted in the future.
 
In April 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") finalized rules on coal combustion residuals ("CCRs"); however, the final rule does not address the placement of CCRs in minefills or non-minefill uses of CCRs at coal mine sites. The Federal Office of Surface Mining ("OSM ") has announced their intention to release a proposed rule to regulate placement and use of CCRs at coal mine sites, but to date, no further action has been taken. These actions by OSM potentially could result in additional delays and costs associated with obtaining permits, prohibitions or restrictions relating to mining activities, and additional enforcement actions.
     6 

  

Bonding Requirements 
 
Federal and state laws require bonds to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining, and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations. These bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis. It has become increasingly difficult for our competitors and us to secure new surety bonds without posting collateral, and in some cases, it is unclear what level of collateral will be required. In addition, surety bond costs have increased while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable to us. It is possible that surety bond issuers may refuse to renew bonds or may demand additional collateral upon those renewals. Our failure to maintain or inability to acquire surety bonds that are required by federal and state laws would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce coal, which could affect our profitability and cash flow.
 Air Emissions

 The Clean Air Act ("CAA") and similar state and local laws and regulations regulate emissions into the air and affect coal mining operations. The CAA directly impacts our coal mining and processing operations by imposing permitting requirements and, in some cases, requirements to install certain emissions control equipment, achieve certain emissions standards, or implement certain work practices on sources that emit various air pollutants. The CAA also indirectly affects coal mining operations by extensively regulating the air emissions of coal-fired electric power generating plants and other coal-burning facilities. There have been a series of federal rulemakings focused on emissions from coal-fired electric generating facilities. Installation of additional emissions control technology and any additional measures required under applicable federal and state laws and regulations related to air emissions will make it more costly to operate coal-fired power plants and possibly other facilities that consume coal and, depending on the requirements of individual state implementation plans (“SIPs”), could make fossil fuels a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of power plants in the future. A significant reduction in fossil fuels’ share of power generating capacity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
In addition to the greenhouse gas (“GHG”) issues discussed below, the air emissions programs that may affect our operations, directly or indirectly, include, but are not limited to, the following:
 

● | The EPA’s Acid Rain Program, provided in Title IV of the CAA, regulates emissions of sulfur dioxide from electric generating facilities. Sulfur dioxide is a by-product of coal combustion. Affected facilities purchase or are otherwise allocated sulfur dioxide emissions allowances, which must be surrendered annually in an amount equal to a facility’s sulfur dioxide emissions in that year. Affected facilities may sell or trade excess allowances to other facilities that require additional allowances to offset their sulfur dioxide emissions. In addition to purchasing or trading for additional sulfur dioxide allowances, affected power facilities can satisfy the requirements of the EPA’s Acid Rain Program by switching to lower-sulfur fuels, installing pollution control devices such as flue gas desulfurization systems, or “scrubbers,” or by reducing electricity generating levels. These requirements would not be supplanted by a replacement rule for the Clean Air Interstate Rule (“CAIR”), discussed below.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The CAIR calls for power plants in 28 states and Washington, D.C. to reduce emission levels of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pursuant to a cap-and-trade program similar to the system in effect for acid rain. In June 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (“CSAPR”), a replacement rule for CAIR, which would have required 28 states in the Midwest and eastern seaboard to reduce power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ozone and/or fine particle pollution in other states. CSAPR has become increasingly irrelevant with continuing coal plant retirements making the nitrogen oxide ozone budget less stringent and lowering emission allowance prices to levels closer to average operating cost for many of our customers. The full impact of CSAPR is unknown at the present time due to the implementation of Mercury and Air Toxic Standards ("MATS"), discussed below, and the impact of the continuing coal plant retirements. 

     7 

  



● | In February 2012, the EPA adopted the MATS, which regulates the emission of mercury and other metals, fine particulates, and acid gases such as hydrogen chloride from coal and oil-fired power plants. In March 2013, the EPA finalized a reconsideration of the MATS rule as it pertains to new power plants, principally adjusting emissions limits to levels attainable by existing control technologies. In subsequent litigation, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the MATS rule based on the EPA’s failure to take costs into consideration. The D.C. Circuit Court allowed the current rule to stay in place until the EPA issued a new finding. In April 2016, the EPA issued a final supplemental finding upholding the rule and concluding that a cost analysis supports the MATS rule. In April 2017, the D.C Circuit Court of Appeals granted the EPA’s request to cancel oral arguments and ordered the case held in abeyance for an EPA review of the supplemental finding. In December 2018, the EPA issued a proposed Supplemental Cost Finding, as well as the CAA required "risk and technology review." In May 2020, EPA issued a final rule that reverses the Agency's prior determination from 2000 and 2016 that it was "appropriate and necessary" to regulate hazardous air pollutants ("HAP") from coal-fueled Electric Generating Units ("EGUs") under the MATS rule. Notwithstanding the invalidation of this threshold regulatory determination, the final rule leaves in place all of the HAP emission control requirements imposed by the MATS rule based on the conclusion that the EGU source category cannot meet the statute's stringent requirements for delisting a source category from HAP regulation. Many electric generators have already announced retirements due to the MATS rule. Although various issues surrounding the MATS rule remain subject to litigation in the D.C. Circuit, the MATS rule has forced generators to make capital investments to retrofit power plants and could lead to additional premature retirements of older coal-fired generating units. The announced and possible additional retirements are likely to reduce the demand for coal. Apart from MATS, several states have enacted or proposed regulations requiring reductions in mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, and federal legislation to reduce mercury emissions from power plants has been proposed. Regulation of mercury emissions by the EPA, states, or Congress may decrease the future demand for coal. We continue to evaluate the possible scenarios associated with CSAPR and MATS and the effects they may have on our business and our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The EPA is required by the CAA to periodically re-evaluate the available health effects information to determine whether the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) should be revised. Pursuant to this process, the EPA has adopted more stringent NAAQS for fine particulate matter (“PM”), ozone, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide. As a result, some states will be required to amend their existing SIPs to attain and maintain compliance with the new air quality standards and other states will be required to develop new SIPs for areas that were previously in “attainment” but do not attain the new standards. In addition, under the revised ozone NAAQS, significant additional emissions control expenditures may be required at coal-fired power plants. In March 2019, the EPA published a final rule that retained the current primary NAAQS for sulfur oxide. In December 2020, EPA published a final rule to retain the current NAAQS for both PM and ozone; however, various entities have filed litigation against one or both of these rulemakings, and the NAAQS may be subject to revision under the Biden Administration. New standards may impose additional emissions control requirements on new and expanded coal-fired power plants and industrial boilers. Because coal mining operations and coal-fired electric generating facilities emit particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, our mining operations and our customers could be affected when the new standards are implemented by the applicable states, and developments might indirectly reduce the demand for coal. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The EPA’s regional haze program is designed to protect and improve visibility at and around national parks, national wilderness areas, and international parks. Under the program, states are required to develop SIPs to improve visibility. Typically, these plans call for reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from coal-fueled electric plants. In prior cases, the EPA has decided to negate the SIPs and impose stringent requirements through FIPs. The regional haze program, including particularly the EPA’s FIPs, and any future regulations may restrict the construction of new coal-fired power plants whose operation may impair visibility at and around federally protected areas and may require some existing coal-fired power plants to install additional control measures designed to limit haze-causing emissions. These requirements could limit the demand for coal in some locations. In September 2018, the EPA issued a memorandum that detailed plans to assist states as they develop their SIPs.

● | The EPA’s new source review (“NSR”) program under the CAA in certain circumstances requires existing coal-fired power plants, when modifications to those plants significantly increase emissions, to install more stringent air emissions control equipment. The Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA, has filed lawsuits against a number of coal-fired electric generating facilities alleging violations of the NSR program. The EPA has alleged that certain modifications have been made to these facilities without first obtaining certain permits issued.

GHG Emissions 
 
Combustion of fossil fuels, such as the coal we produce, results in the emission of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Combustion of fuel for mining equipment used in coal production also emits GHGs. Future regulation of GHG emissions in the U.S. could occur pursuant to future U.S. treaty commitments, new domestic legislation or regulation by the EPA.  Although no comprehensive climate change regulation has been adopted at the federal level in the United States, President Biden has announced that climate change will be a focus of his administration. For example, in January 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that commits to substantial action on climate change, calling for, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil-fuel industry, a doubling of electricity generated by offshore wind by 2030, and increased emphasis on climate-related risks across governmental agencies and economic sectors. Internationally, the Paris Agreement requires member states to submit non-binding, individually-determined emissions reduction targets. These commitments could further reduce demand and prices for fossil fuels. Although the United States had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, President Biden recommitted the United States in February 2021 and, in April 2021, announced a new, more rigorous nationally determined emissions reduction level of 50-52% reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net GHG emissions by 2030. The international community gathered again in Glasgow in November 2021 at the 26th Conference to the Parties ("COP26") during which multiple announcements were made, including a call for parties to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies, among other measures. Relatedly, the United States and European Union jointly announced at COP26 the launch of the Global Methane Pledge, an initiative committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030, including "all feasible reductions" in the energy sector. Also at COP26, more than forty countries pledged to phase out coal, although the United States did not sign the pledge. The impact of these actions remains unclear at this time. Moreover, many states, regions, and governmental bodies have adopted GHG initiatives and have or are considering the imposition of fees or taxes based on the emission of GHGs by certain facilities, including coal-fired electric generating facilities. Others have announced their intent to increase the use of renewable energy sources, displacing coal and other fossil fuels. Depending on the particular regulatory program that may be enacted, at either the federal or state level, the demand for coal could be negatively impacted, which would have an adverse effect on our operations.
 
Even in the absence of new federal legislation, the EPA has begun to regulate GHG emissions under the CAA based on the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2007 decision that the EPA has authority to regulate GHG emissions. Although the U.S. Supreme Court’s holding did not expressly involve the EPA’s authority to regulate GHG emissions from stationary sources, such as coal-fueled power plants, the EPA has determined on its own that it has the authority to regulate GHG emissions from power plants and issued a final rule which found that GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, endanger both the public health and welfare.
 
 Several rulemakings have been issued under the EPA's  New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") that constrain the GHG emissions of fossil-fuel-fired power plants. In January 2021, the EPA published a final significant contribution finding for purposes of regulating source category of GHG emissions, confirming that such power plants are a source category for such regulations. However, this finding also excludes several sectors and may, therefore, be subject to revision, and future implementation of the NSPS is uncertain at this time. 
 
In August 2015, the EPA issued its final Clean Power Plan ("CPP") rules that establish carbon pollution standards for power plants, called CO2 emission performance rates. Judicial challenges led the U.S. Supreme Court to grant a stay in February 2016 of the implementation of the CPP before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ("Circuit Court") even issued a decision. Then, in October 2017 the EPA proposed to repeal the CPP.  The EPA subsequently proposed the Affordable Clean Energy ("ACE") rule to replace the CPP with a rule that utilizes heat rate improvement measures as the "best system of emission reduction." The ACE rule adopts new implementing regulations under the CAA to clarify the roles of the EPA and the states, including an extension of the deadline for state plans and EPA approvals; and the rule revises the NSR permitting program to provide EGUs the opportunity to make efficiency improvements without triggering NSR permit requirements. In June 2019, the EPA published the final repeal of the CPP and promulgation of the ACE rule.  The EPA’s attempts to replace the CPP with the ACE rule are currently subject to litigation, and on January 19, 2021 , the Circuit Court struck down the ACE rule. The EPA has since announced an intent to consider new regulations governing carbon emissions from existing power plants. The EPA’s draft strategic plan issued in November 2021 emphasizes climate change and environmental justice as its top two priorities.
 
Notwithstanding the ACE rule, these requirements have led to premature retirements and could lead to additional premature retirements of coal-fired generating units and reduce the demand for coal. Congress has not currently adopted legislation to restrict carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants, and it is unclear whether the EPA has the legal authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from existing and modified power plants as proposed in the NSPS and CPP. Substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the coal we produce.

There have been numerous protests and challenges to the permitting of new fossil fuel infrastructure, including coal-fired power plants and pipelines, by environmental organizations and state regulators for concerns related to GHG emissions. For instance, various state regulatory authorities have rejected the construction of new coal-fueled power plants based on the uncertainty surrounding the potential costs associated with GHG emissions from these plants under future laws limiting the emissions of carbon dioxide. In addition, several permits issued to new coal-fueled power plants without limits on GHG emissions have been appealed to the EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board. In addition, over thirty states have currently adopted “renewable energy standards” or “renewable portfolio standards,” which encourage or require electric utilities to obtain a certain percentage of their electric generation portfolio from renewable resources by a certain date. Several states have announced their intent to have renewable energy comprise 100% of their electric generation portfolio. Other states may adopt similar requirements, and federal legislation is a possibility in this area. In December 2021, President Biden issued an executive order setting a goal for a carbon pollution-free electricity sector across the country by 2035.  To the extent these requirements affect our current and prospective customers, they may reduce the demand for fossil fuel energy, and may affect long-term demand for our coal. Finally, while the U.S. Supreme Court has held that federal common law provides no basis for public nuisance claims against utilities due to their carbon dioxide emissions, the Court did not decide whether similar claims can be brought under state common law. As a result, despite this favorable ruling, tort-type liabilities remain a concern.
 
In addition, environmental advocacy groups have filed a variety of judicial challenges claiming that the environmental analyses conducted by federal agencies before granting permits and other approvals necessary for certain coal activities do not satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). These groups assert that the environmental analyses in question do not adequately consider the climate change impacts of these particular projects. In July 2020, the Council on Environmental Quality ("CEQ ") finalized revisions to NEPA that clarify the extent to which direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts from a proposed project, including GHG emissions, should be examined under NEPA.  In October 2021, the CEQ published a proposed rule to restore, in general, NEPA regulations that were in effect before being modified by the 2020 revisions. A final rule is expected in 2022.
 Many states and regions have adopted GHG initiatives, and certain governmental bodies have or are considering the imposition of fees or taxes based on the emission of GHG by certain facilities, including coal-fired electric generating facilities. For example, in 2005, ten Northeastern states entered into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative agreement (“RGGI”), calling for the implementation of a cap and trade program aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in the participating states. The members of RGGI have established in statutes and/or regulations a carbon dioxide trading program. Auctions for carbon dioxide allowances under the program began in September 2008. Since its inception, several additional states and Canadian provinces have joined RGGI as participants or observers, while Virginia has withdrawn from RGGI via executive order by its governor.
 
Following the RGGI model, five Western states launched the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative to identify, evaluate, and implement collective and cooperative methods of reducing GHG in the region to 15% below 2005 levels by 2020. These states were joined by two additional states and four Canadian provinces and became collectively known as the Western Climate Initiative Partners. However, only California and certain Canadian provinces are currently active participants in the Western Climate Initiative. Nevertheless, it is likely that these regional efforts will continue based on current trends and concerns related to the reduction of GHG emissions.
 
It is possible that future international, federal and state initiatives to control GHG emissions could result in increased costs associated with fossil fuel production and consumption, such as costs to install additional controls to reduce carbon dioxide emissions or costs to purchase emissions reduction credits to comply with future emissions trading programs. Such increased costs for fossil fuel consumption could result in some customers switching to alternative sources of fuel, or otherwise adversely affect our operations and demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Finally, activists may try to hamper fossil fuel companies by other means, including pressuring financing and other institutions into restricting access to capital, bonding and insurance, as well as pursuing tort litigation for various alleged climate-related impacts.

Water Discharge 
 
The Federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and similar state and local laws and regulations regulate discharges into certain waters, primarily through permitting. Section 404 of the CWA imposes permitting and mitigation requirements associated with the dredging and filling of certain wetlands and streams. The CWA and equivalent state legislation, where such equivalent state legislation exists, affect coal mining operations that impact such wetlands and streams. Although permitting requirements have been tightened in recent years, we believe we have obtained all necessary permits required under CWA Section 404 as it has traditionally been interpreted by the responsible agencies. However, mitigation requirements under existing and possible future “fill” permits may vary considerably. For that reason, the setting of post-mine asset retirement obligation accruals for such mitigation projects is difficult to ascertain with certainty and may increase in the future.  Although more stringent permitting requirements may be imposed in the future, we are not able to accurately predict the impact, if any, of such permitting requirements.
 
In order for us to conduct certain activities, we may need to obtain a permit for the discharge of fill material from the United States Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps of Engineers") and/or a discharge permit from the state regulatory authority under the state counterpart to the CWA. Our coal mining operations typically require Section 404 permits to authorize activities such as the creation of slurry ponds and stream impoundments. The CWA authorizes the EPA to review Section 404 permits issued by the Corps of Engineers.
 
The EPA also has statutory “veto” power over a Section 404 permit if the EPA determines, after notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, that the permit will have an “unacceptable adverse effect.”  In January 2011, the EPA exercised its veto power to withdraw or restrict the use of a previously issued permit for Spruce No. 1 Surface Mine in West Virginia, which is one of the largest surface mining operations ever authorized in Appalachia. This action was the first time that such power was exercised with regard to a previously permitted coal mining project which veto was subsequently upheld by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2013. Any future use of the EPA’s Section 404 “veto” power could create uncertainty with regard to our continued use of current permits, as well as impose additional time and cost burdens on future operations, potentially adversely affecting our coal revenues. In addition, the EPA initiated a preemptive veto prior to the filing of any actual permit application for a copper and gold mine based on a fictitious mine scenario. The implications of this decision could allow the EPA to bypass the state permitting process and engage in watershed and land use planning.
 
Total Maximum Daily Load (“TMDL”) regulations under the CWA establish a process to calculate the maximum amount of a pollutant that an impaired waterbody can receive and still meet state water quality standards and to allocate pollutant loads among the point and non-point pollutant sources discharging into that water body. Likewise, when water quality in a receiving stream is better than required, states are required to conduct an antidegradation review before approving discharge permits. The adoption of new TMDL-related allocations or any changes to antidegradation policies for streams near our coal mines could require more costly water treatment and could adversely affect our coal production.
 
Considerable legal uncertainty exists surrounding the standard for what constitutes jurisdictional waters and wetlands subject to the protections and requirements of the CWA. Rulemakings to establish the extent of such jurisdiction were finalized in 2015 and 2020, respectively, and both rulemakings have been subject to substantial litigation. On August 30, 2021, the US District Court for Arizona granted a request for voluntary remand of the EPA's rule. The Biden Administration has announced plans to establish its own definition of "waters of the United States" ("WOTUS"). Most recently, the EPA and the Corps of Engineers published a proposed rulemaking to revoke the 2020 rule in favor of a pre-2015 definition until a new definition is proposed, which the Biden Administration has announced is underway. Additionally, in January 2022, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case on the scope and authority of the CWA and the definition of WOTUS. To the extent any decision expands the scope of the EPA and the Corps of Engineers’ jurisdiction under the CWA, we could face increased costs and delays due to additional permitting and regulatory requirements and possible challenges to permitting decision

Hazardous Substances and Wastes 
 
The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), otherwise known as the “Superfund” law, and analogous state laws, impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for the release of hazardous substances may be subject to joint and several liability under CERCLA for the costs of cleaning up releases of hazardous substances and natural resource damages. Some products used in coal mining operations generate waste containing hazardous substances. We are currently unaware of any material liability associated with the release or disposal of hazardous substances from our past or present mine sites.
 
The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and analogous state laws impose requirements for the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal, and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Many mining wastes are excluded from the regulatory definition of hazardous wastes, and coal mining operations covered by SMCRA permits are by statute exempted from RCRA permitting. RCRA also allows the EPA to require corrective action at sites where there is a release of hazardous substances. In addition, each state has its own laws regarding the proper management and disposal of waste material. While these laws impose ongoing compliance obligations, such costs are not believed to have a material impact on our operations.
 
RCRA impacts the coal industry in particular because it regulates the disposal of certain coal combustion by-products (“CCB”). On April 17, 2015, the EPA finalized regulations under RCRA for the disposal of CCB. Under the finalized regulations, CCB is regulated as "non-hazardous" waste and avoids the stricter, more costly, regulations under RCRA's hazardous waste rules. While classification of CCB as a hazardous waste would have led to more stringent restrictions and higher costs, this regulation may still increase our customers' operating costs and potentially reduce their ability to purchase coal. The CCB rule was subject to legal challenge and ultimately remanded to the EPA. On August 28, 2020, the EPA published a final revised rule mandating closure of unlined impoundments, with deadlines to initiate closure between 2021 and 2028, depending on site specific circumstances. Certain provisions of the revised CCB rule were vacated by the D.C. Circuit in 2018. The EPA is expected to finalize additional rules addressing those specific provisions in 2022 and 2023. Meanwhile, on January 25, 2022, the EPA published determinations for 9 of 57 CCB facilities who sought approval to continue disposal of CCB and non-CCB waste streams until 2023, as opposed to the initial 2021 deadline for unlined impoundments prescribed by the current rule. While the EPA issued one conditional approval, the EPA is requiring the remaining facilities to cease receipt of waste within 135 days of completion of public comment, or around July 2022. The current determinations, future determinations of the same nature, or similar actions in expected future rulemakings could lead to accelerated, abrupt, or unplanned suspension of coal-fired boilers. The combined effect of the CCB rules and ELG regulations (discussed below) has compelled power generating companies to close existing ash ponds and may force the closure of certain existing coal burning power plants that cannot comply with the new standards. Such retirements may adversely affect the demand for our coal.
 
On November 3, 2015, the EPA published the final rule Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards (“ELG”), revising the regulations for the Steam Electric Power Generating category which became effective on January 4, 2016. The rule sets the first federal limits on the levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from power plants, based on technology improvements in the steam electric power industry over the last three decades. The combined effect of the CCB and ELG regulations has forced power generating companies to close existing ash ponds and will likely force the closure of certain older existing coal-burning power plants that cannot comply with the new standards. In November 2019, the EPA proposed revisions to the 2015 ELG rule and announced proposed changes to regulations for the disposal of coal ash in order to reduce compliance costs.  In October 2020, the EPA published a final rule. In August 2021, the EPA initiated supplemental rulemaking indicating that it intended to strengthen certain discharge limits. The EPA expects to issue a proposed rule for public comment in fall 2022.  It is unclear what impact these regulations will have on the market for our products.
 
Endangered Species Act 
 
The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and counterpart state legislation protect species threatened with possible extinction. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the “USFWS”) works closely with the OSM and state regulatory agencies to ensure that species subject to the ESA are protected from potential impacts from mining-related activities. In October 2021, the Biden Administration proposed the rollback of new rules promulgated under the Trump Administration; namely, the USFWS plans to rescind the 2018 rule that revised the process for designating critical habitat for threatened and endangered species under the ESA and second, alongside the National Marine Fisheries Service, the USFWS proposes to rescind the 2020 regulatory definition of "habitat." Final action on these proposed rules will occur in 2022. 
 
    12 

  

If the USFWS were to designate species indigenous to the areas in which we operate as threatened or endangered, or to re-designate a species from threatened to endangered, we could be subject to additional regulatory and permitting requirements, which in turn could increase operating costs or adversely affect our revenues.
 
Other Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation
 
In addition to the laws and regulations described above, we are subject to regulations regarding underground and above ground storage tanks in which we may store petroleum or other substances. Some monitoring equipment that we use is subject to licensing under the Federal Atomic Energy Act. Water supply wells located on our properties are subject to federal, state, and local regulations. In addition, our use of explosives is subject to the Federal Safe Explosives Act. We are also required to comply with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act, and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. The costs of compliance with these regulations should not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Suppliers 
 
The main types of goods we purchase are mining equipment and replacement parts, steel-related (including roof control) products, belting products, lubricants, electricity, fuel, and tires. Although we have many long, well-established relationships with our key suppliers, we do not believe that we are dependent on any of our individual suppliers other than for purchases of electricity. The supplier base providing mining materials has been relatively consistent in recent years. Purchases of certain underground mining equipment are concentrated with one principal supplier; however, supplier competition continues to develop.
Illinois Basin (ILB) 
 
The coal industry underwent a significant transformation in the early 1990s, as greater environmental accountability was established in the electric utility industry. Through the U.S. Clean Air Act, acceptable baseline levels were established for the release of sulfur dioxide in power plant emissions. In order to comply with the new law, most utilities switched fuel consumption to low-sulfur coal, thereby stripping the ILB of over 50 million tons of annual coal demand. This strategy continued until mid-2000 when a shortage of low-sulfur coal drove up prices. This price increase combined with the assurance from the U.S. government that the utility industry would be able to recoup their costs to install scrubbers caused utilities to begin investing in scrubbers on a large scale. With scrubbers, the ILB re-opened as a significant fuel source for utilities and has enabled them to burn lower-cost high sulfur coal.
 
The ILB consists of coal mining operations covering more than 50,000 square miles in Illinois, Indiana, and western Kentucky. The ILB is centrally located between four of the largest regions that consume coal as fuel for electricity generation (East North Central, West South Central, West North Central, and East South Central). The region also has access to sufficient rail and water transportation routes that service coal-fired power plants in these regions as well as other significant coal consuming regions of the South Atlantic and Middle Atlantic.
 
U. S. Coal Industry 
 
The major coal production basins in the U.S. include Central Appalachia (CAPP), Northern Appalachia (NAPP), Illinois Basin (ILB), Powder River Basin (PRB), and the Western Bituminous region (WB). CAPP includes eastern Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia and southern West Virginia. NAPP includes Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and northern West Virginia. The ILB includes Illinois, Indiana, and western Kentucky. The PRB is located in northeastern Wyoming and southeastern Montana. The WB includes western Colorado, eastern Utah, and southern Wyoming. Hallador, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Sunrise Coal, LLC, mines coal exclusively in the ILB.
 
Coal type varies by basin. Heat value and sulfur content are important quality characteristics and determine the end-use for each coal type.
 
Coal in the U.S. is mined through surface and underground mining methods. The primary underground mining techniques are longwall mining and continuous (room-and-pillar) mining. The geological conditions dictate which technique to use. Our mines utilize the continuous mining technique. In continuous mining, rooms are cut into the coal bed leaving a series of pillars, or columns of coal, to help support the mine roof and control the flow of air. Continuous mining equipment cuts the coal from the mining face. Generally, openings are driven 20’ wide, and the pillars are rectangular in shape measuring 40’x 40’. As mining advances, a grid-like pattern of entries and pillars is formed. Roof bolts are used to secure the roof of the mine. Battery cars move the coal to the conveyor belt for transport to the surface. The pillars can constitute up to 50% of the total coal in a seam.
     13 

  

The United States coal industry is highly competitive, with numerous producers selling into all markets that use coal. We compete against large producers such as Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE: BTU), Alliance Resource Partners (Nasdaq: ARLP), and other private producers.
 
Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2021, Hallador Energy Company and its subsidiaries employed 805 full-time employees and temporary miners.  760 of those employees and temporary miners are directly involved in the coal mining or coal washing process.   Our workforce is entirely union-free.  To attract and retain top talent, we provide competitive wages, an annual bonus for all employees, excellent benefits, an employee health clinic, and a culture that is committed to health and safety at all levels. 
 
Employee health and safety is a top priority at Hallador Energy’s wholly owned subsidiary, Sunrise Coal, LLC.   With a robust safety department and safety standards that exceed mandated guidelines, we make safety the foundation of everything we do.  While every precaution is taken to prevent mine emergencies, Sunrise Coal has its own private mine rescue team.  This team is trained and ready to manage any emergency at a Sunrise Coal, LLC facility, but also ready and available to assist other mine rescue teams.   In addition to a highly decorated private mine rescue team, Sunrise Coal in 2021 had three employees on the Indiana State Mine Rescue team and one team trainer which was more than any other mine in Indiana.  We continuously monitor safety data such as injury severity, violations per inspection day, and significant and substantial citations and compare to the national averages noting that in 2021 we were at or below the national averages in all three categories.  For more information about citations or orders for violations of standards under the FMSHA, as amended by the Miner Act, please see our Exhibit 95.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
While other companies have moved to high deductible health plans, Hallador Energy is committed to providing comprehensive affordable health insurance with low-cost deductibles and co-pays to take care of our employees and their families.  We believe in decreasing the barriers to healthcare, so employees and their dependents do not have to delay care.  Our employees and their families also have access to a private full-time health and wellness clinic, with free medications, no cost diagnostics, and a wellness coach. 
 
Beyond investing in the safety and health of its employees, Hallador Energy invests in educational opportunities for its employees.  All continuing education requirements and training are completely paid for by the company and tuition reimbursement programs are available to every employee companywide.
 
We are committed to protecting our employees and doing our part to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 while implementing contingency plans to ensure that we continue to supply our customers without interruption. As the situation has continued to evolve, we continue to monitor the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines to keep our employees and their families safe. We have instituted many policies and procedures, in alignment with CDC guidelines along with state and local mandates, to protect our employees during the COVID-19 outbreak. We plan to keep these policies and procedures in place, in accordance with CDC, state, and local guidelines, and continually evaluate further enhancements for as long as necessary. As vaccines for COVID-19 continue to become readily available, we intend to continue encouraging our workforce to get vaccinated, and we are hopeful that the case rate of our employees will continue to decline, and economic activity in general will continue to accelerate.  We continue to offer cash incentives to employees who show proof of vaccination.
 
Other 
 
We have no significant patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises or concessions.
 
Our corporate office is located at 1183 East Canvasback Drive, Terre Haute, Indiana, 47802, and Sunrise Coal’s corporate office is at the same location, phone 812.299.2800. Terre Haute is approximately 70 miles west of Indianapolis.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 

 (1)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
   Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hallador Energy Company (hereinafter known as, “we, us, or our”) and its wholly owned subsidiaries Sunrise Coal, LLC (Sunrise) and Hourglass Sands, LLC (Hourglass), and Sunrise’s wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Sunrise is engaged in the production of steam coal from mines located in western Indiana.   Going Concern - Alleviation of Substantial Doubt
   In accordance with ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements- Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) – Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, we are required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that our financials are issued. When management identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about their ability to continue as a going concern it should consider whether its plans to mitigate those relevant conditions or events will alleviate the substantial doubt. If conditions or events raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, but the substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of management’s plans, the entity should disclose information that enables user of financial statements to understand the principal events that raised the substantial doubt, management’s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events, and management’s plans that alleviated substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.   We performed the analysis, and our overall assessment was there were conditions or events, considered in the aggregate as of  December 31, 2021, which raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within the next year, but such doubt was adequately mitigated by our plans to address the substantial doubt.   The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. During our analysis and overall assessment, it became clear that we were likely to violate one or more of our financial covenants due to a step down of our leverage ratio and a step up of our debt service coverage ratio beginning with quarter ending  March 31, 2022 due to lower than expected EBITDA, a significant factor in the calculation of both ratios. This factor raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.   In  March 2022, as disclosed in Note 5, the Company executed an amendment to our credit agreement providing relief on the covenants in question until the time our internal projections show that we will again meet the covenants.   Accordingly, the above factors have alleviated substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.   Segment Information 
   The Company’s significant operating segment includes the two Oaktown underground mines located in southwestern Indiana. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) reviews the operating results, assesses performance and makes decisions about allocation of resources to this segment at the mine level, however, we aggregate the results of operations of the mines for reporting purposes since the nature of the product, production process, customer type, product distribution, and long-term economic characteristics at each mine are similar.   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
   The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for uncollectible receivables based on a review of account balances that are likely to be uncollectible, as determined by such variables as customer creditworthiness, the age of the receivables and disputed amounts. Historically, credit losses have been insignificant. At  December 31, 2021 and 2020, no allowance was recorded for uncollectible accounts receivable as all amounts were deemed collectible.   Inventory 
   Inventory and parts and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value determined using the first-in first-out method. Inventory costs include labor, supplies, operating overhead, and other related costs incurred at or on behalf of the mining location, including depreciation, depletion, and amortization of equipment, buildings, mineral rights, and mine development costs.   Prepaid expenses 
   Prepaid expenses include prepaid insurance, prepaid maintenance expense, and a prepaid balance with our primary parts and supplies vendor.   Advanced Royalties 
   Coal leases that require minimum annual or advance payments and are recoverable from future production are generally deferred and charged to expense as the coal is subsequently produced. Advance royalties are included in other assets.   Mining Properties 
   Mining properties are recorded at cost. Interest costs applicable to major asset additions are capitalized during the construction period. Expenditures that extend the useful lives or increase the productivity of the assets are capitalized. The cost of maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful lives or increase the productivity of the assets are expensed as incurred. Other than land and most mining equipment, mining properties are depreciated using the units-of-production method over the estimated recoverable reserves. Most surface and underground mining equipment is depreciated using estimated useful lives ranging from three to twenty-five years.   If facts and circumstances suggest that a long-lived asset  may be impaired, the carrying value is reviewed for recoverability. If this review indicates that the carrying value of the asset will not be recoverable through estimated undiscounted future net cash flows related to the asset over its remaining life, then an impairment loss is recognized by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. See Note 2 for further discussion of impairments.      
49
  
  Mine Development 
   Costs of developing new mines, including asset retirement obligation assets, or significantly expanding the capacity of existing mines, are capitalized and amortized using the units-of-production method over estimated recoverable reserves.   Asset Retirement Obligations (ARO) – Reclamation 
   At the time they are incurred, legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets are reflected at their estimated fair value, with a corresponding charge to mine development. Obligations are typically incurred when we commence development of underground and surface mines and include reclamation of support facilities, refuse areas and slurry ponds.   Obligations are reflected at the present value of their future cash flows. We reflect accretion of the obligations for the period from the date they are incurred through the date they are extinguished. The ARO assets are amortized using the units-of-production method over estimated recoverable (proven and probable) reserves. We are using credit-adjusted risk-free discount rates ranging from 5.0% to 10% to discount the obligation, inflation rates anticipated during the time to reclamation, and cost estimates prepared by our engineers inclusive of market risk premiums.  Federal and state laws require that mines be reclaimed in accordance with specific standards and approved reclamation plans, as outlined in mining permits. Activities include reclamation of pit and support acreage at surface mines, sealing portals at underground mines, and reclamation of refuse areas and slurry ponds.   We review our ARO at least annually and reflect revisions for permit changes, changes in our estimated reclamation costs and changes in the estimated timing of such costs. The change in estimate was a result of a change in timing of expected reclamation of the Ace in the Hole Mine, Carlisle Mine, and Prosperity Mine and updates to inflation rates from when the liabilities were first projected. In the event we are not able to perform reclamation, we have surety bonds totaling $23.5 million to cover ARO.    The table below (in thousands) reflects the changes to our ARO:

     Interest Rate Swaps
   The Company generally utilizes derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rate risk on long-term debt. The Company enters into interest rate swaps in order to achieve a mix of fixed and variable rate debt that it deems appropriate. These interest rate swaps have not been designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as an asset or a liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses are classified as operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.    Statement of Cash Flows 
   Cash equivalents include investments with maturities when purchased of three months or less.   Income Taxes 
   Income taxes are provided based on the liability method of accounting. The provision for income taxes is based on pretax financial income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future expected tax consequences of temporary differences between income tax and financial reporting and principally relate to differences in the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which differences are expected to reverse.         50  Net Income (Loss) per Share 
   Basic net income (loss) per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period using the two-class method for our common shares and RSUs which share in the Company’s earnings. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares include restricted stock units and are included in basic net income (loss) per share, using the two-class method.   Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements 
   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates included in the preparation of the financial statements relate to: (i) deferred income tax accounts, (ii) coal reserves, (iii) depreciation, depletion, and amortization, (iv) estimates relating to interest rate swaps, (v) estimates used in our impairment analysis and measurement of impairments, and (vi) estimates used in the calculation of our asset retirement obligations.   Long-term Contracts 
   As of  December 31, 2021, we are committed to supplying our customers up to a maximum of 20.7 million tons of coal through 2027 of which 16.2 million tons are priced.   For 2021, we derived 95% of our coal sales from five customers, each representing at least 10% of our coal sales. 99% of our accounts receivable was from five customers, each representing more than 10% of the  December 31, 2021 balance.   For 2020, we derived 79% of our coal sales from four customers, each representing at least 10% of our coal sales. 87% of our accounts receivable was from four customers, each representing more than 10% of the  December 31, 2020 balance.   Stock-based Compensation 
   Stock-based compensation for restricted stock units is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the applicable vesting period of the stock award (generally two to four years) using the straight-line method.         51 (2)    LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS 
   Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of the assets  may not be recoverable.  The impact of COVID-19 is being monitored closely, but for the years ended  December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no material COVID-19 related impairment charges recorded for long-lived assets.   Prosperity Mine 
   We recorded an impairment of $1.6 million as of  December 31, 2021 on assets consisting of the wash plant and rail facilities at the Prosperity Mine.  The wash plant was torn down and the remaining rail was pulled up in the fourth quarter of 2021.  We have estimated the scrap value to be $1.1 million on the carrying value of $2.7 million.  The remaining scrap will be sold in 2022.    Hourglass Sands 
   We recorded an impairment of $2.9 million as of  December 31, 2019, due to softness in the pricing of the frac sand market.  The impairment included inventory, land, mine development, buildings and equipment and was determined using a market approach.  The remaining fair market value of inventory, equipment, and buildings at Hourglass Sands was $1.9 million as of  December 31, 2019.  Due to the continued regression of the frac sand market, in  August 2020, we ceased operations of the plant and recorded an impairment of $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2020, which included the remaining inventory and buildings and which was determined using a market approach.   (3)  INVENTORY 
   Inventory is valued at lower of average cost or net realizable value (NRV).  As of  December 31, 2021, and  December 31, 2020, coal inventory includes NRV adjustments of $3.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively.   (4)  OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS (IN THOUSANDS)

  (5)  BANK DEBT 
   On  April 15, 2020, we executed an amendment to our credit agreement with PNC, administrative agent for our lenders.  The primary purposes of the amendment were to modify the allowable leverage ratio over the term of the loan to increase available liquidity.   As a result of the amendment, our maximum annual capital expenditures are limited to $30 million for 2020 and $25 million for each year thereafter with carryover provisions of unused expenditures, and our dividend is suspended until our leverage ratio falls below 2.0X.
   On  March 25, 2022, we executed another amendment to our credit agreement with PNC to return the allowable leverage ratio and debt service coverage ratio to their  December 31, 2021 levels through  September 30, 2022, with the debt service coverage ratio waived for  March 31, 2022.
   During 2021, we reduced our bank debt by $26.0 million through net cash payments, which as of  December 31, 2021, was $111.7 million.  Bank debt is comprised of term debt ($31.2 million as of  December 31, 2021) and a $120.0 million revolver ($80.5 million borrowed as of  December 31, 2021).  The term debt amortization concludes with the final payment in  March 2023.  The revolver matures  September 2023.  Our debt is recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value due to the variable interest rates in the agreement and is collateralized primarily by our assets.   Liquidity 
   As of  December 31, 2021, we had additional borrowing capacity of $33.4 million under the revolver and total liquidity of $35.9 million.  Our additional borrowing capacity is net of $5.7 million in outstanding letters of credit as of  December 31, 2021 that were required to maintain surety bonds.  Liquidity consists of our additional borrowing capacity and cash and cash equivalents.   Fees 
   Unamortized bank fees and other costs incurred in connection with the initial facility and subsequent amendments totaled $7.9 million as of our amendment in  April 2020. Additional costs incurred with the  April 15, 2020 amendment were $1.9 million. Additional fees of $0.4 million were incurred in  May 2021, for a technical amendment related to our entry into the renewable power market.   These costs were deferred and are being amortized over the term of the loan. Unamortized costs as of  December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $4.0 million and $6.1 million, respectively.     Bank debt, less debt issuance costs, is presented below (in thousands):

  Covenants 
   The credit facility includes a Maximum Leverage Ratio (consolidated funded debt / trailing twelve months adjusted EBITDA), calculated as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the trailing twelve months, not to exceed the amounts below:    
Fiscal Periods Ending | Ratio 
---------------------------------------------------+-------------
December 31, 2021 | 3.00 to 1.00
March 31, 2022, and each fiscal quarter thereafter | 2.50 to 1.00

    As of  December 31, 2021, our Leverage Ratio of 2.34 was in compliance with the requirements of the credit agreement.   The credit facility also requires a Minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio (consolidated adjusted EBITDA / annual debt service) calculated as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the trailing twelve months of 1.05 to 1.00 through  December 31, 2021, at which time it increases to 1.25 to 1.00 through the maturity of the credit facility.    As of  December 31, 2021, our Debt Service Coverage Ratio of 1.11 was in compliance with the requirements of the credit agreement.   Interest Rate 
   The interest rate on the facility ranges from LIBOR plus 2.75% to LIBOR plus 4.00%, depending on our Leverage Ratio, with a LIBOR floor of 0.50%.  We entered into swap agreements to fix the LIBOR component of the interest rate at 2.92% on the declining term loan balance and on $52.7 million of the revolver. At  December 31, 2021, we are paying LIBOR at the swap rate of 2.92% plus 3.50% for a total interest rate of 6.42% on the hedged amount ($83.9 million) and 3.5% on the remainder ($27.8 million).

Paycheck Protection Program
   As previously reported in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on  April 16, 2020, we entered into a Paycheck Protection Program Promissory Note and Agreement on  April 15, 2020, evidencing an unsecured $10 million loan (the “PPP Loan”) under the Paycheck Protection Program (or “PPP”) made through First Financial Bank, N.A., (the "Lender"). The PPP was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”).   Under the terms of the CARES Act, PPP loan recipients can apply for forgiveness. The SBA can grant forgiveness of all, or a portion of, loans made under the PPP if the recipients use the PPP loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent or utility costs, and meet other requirements regarding, among other things, the maintenance of employment and compensation levels. The Company used the PPP Loan proceeds for qualifying expenses and applied for the forgiveness of the PPP Loan in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act.   On  July 23, 2021, we received a notification from the Lender that the SBA approved our PPP Loan forgiveness application for the entire PPP Loan balance of $10 million, together with interest accrued thereon. The Lender notified us that the forgiveness payment was received on  July 26, 2021.  The forgiveness of the PPP Loan is recognized as other income.   The SBA retains the right to review the Company's loan file for a period subsequent to the date the loan is forgiven, with the potential for the SBA to pursue legal remedies at its discretion.   At  December 31, 2020, the PPP loan totaling $10 million is presented as current and long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets based upon the schedule of repayments and excluding any possible forgiveness of the loan.

 (7)   REVENUE 
   Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
   We account for a contract with a customer when the parties have approved the contract and are committed to performing their respective obligations, the rights of each party are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of consideration is probable. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a good or service to a customer.  We utilize the normal purchase normal sales exception for all long-term sales contracts.   Our revenue is derived from sales to customers of coal produced at our facilities. Our customers purchase coal directly from our mine sites and our Princeton Loop, where the sale occurs and where title, risk of loss, and control typically pass to the customer at that point. Our customers arrange for and bear the costs of transporting their coal from our mines to their plants or other specified discharge points. Our customers are typically domestic utility companies. Our coal sales agreements with our customers are fixed-priced, fixed-volume supply contracts, or include a predetermined escalation in price for each year. Price re-opener and index provisions  may allow either party to commence a renegotiation of the contract price at a pre-determined time. Price re-opener provisions  may automatically set a new price based on prevailing market price or, in some instances, require us to negotiate a new price, sometimes within specified ranges of prices. The terms of our coal sales agreements result from competitive bidding and extensive negotiations with customers. Consequently, the terms of these contracts vary by customer.   Coal sales agreements will typically contain coal quality specifications. With coal quality specifications in place, the raw coal sold by us to the customer at the delivery point must be substantially free of magnetic material and other foreign material impurities and crushed to a maximum size as set forth in the respective coal sales agreement. Price adjustments are made and billed in the month the coal sale was recognized based on quality standards that are specified in the coal sales agreement, such as Btu factor, moisture, ash, and sulfur content and can result in either increases or decreases in the value of the coal shipped.   Disaggregation of Revenue 
   Revenue is disaggregated by primary geographic markets, as we believe this best depicts how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. 73% and 74% of our coal revenue for the years ended  December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was sold to customers in the State of Indiana with the remainder sold to customers in Florida, North Carolina, Kentucky, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee.   Performance Obligations 
   A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to provide distinct goods or services. Performance obligations are the unit of account for purposes of applying the revenue recognition standard and therefore determine when and how revenue is recognized. In most of our contracts, the customer contracts with us to provide coal that meets certain quality criteria. We consider each ton of coal a separate performance obligation and allocate the transaction price based on the base price per the contract, increased or decreased for quality adjustments.   We recognize revenue at a point in time as the customer does not have control over the asset at any point during the fulfillment of the contract. For substantially all of our customers, this is supported by the fact that title and risk of loss transfer to the customer upon loading of the truck or railcar at the mine. This is also the point at which physical possession of the coal transfers to the customer, as well as the right to receive substantially all benefits and the risk of loss in ownership of the coal.         55
  
We have remaining performance obligations relating to fixed priced contracts of approximately $588 million, which represent the average fixed prices on our committed contracts as of  December 31, 2021. We expect to recognize approximately 85% of this revenue in 2022 and 2023, with the remainder recognized thereafter.   We have remaining performance obligations relating to contracts with price reopeners of approximately $166 million, which represents our estimate of the expected re-opener price on committed contracts as of  December 31, 2021. We expect to recognize all of this revenue beginning in 2024.
   The tons used to determine the remaining performance obligations are subject to adjustment in instances of force majeure and exercise of customer options to either take additional tons or reduce tonnage if such option exists in the customer contract.   Contract Balances 
   Under ASC 606, the timing of when a performance obligation is satisfied can affect the presentation of accounts receivable, contract assets, and contract liabilities. The main distinction between accounts receivable and contract assets is whether consideration is conditional on something other than the passage of time. A receivable is an entity’s right to consideration that is unconditional. Under the typical payment terms of our contracts with customers, the customer pays us a base price for the coal, increased or decreased for any quality adjustments. Amounts billed and due are recorded as trade accounts receivable and included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets. As of  January 1, 2020, accounts receivable for coal sales billed to customers was $14.4 million. We do not currently have any contracts in place where we would transfer coal in advance of knowing the final price of the coal sold, and thus do not have any contract assets recorded.

  Our effective tax rate (ETR) for 2021 was (1%) compared to 30% for 2020. The tax rate for the years ended  December 31, 2021 and 2020 are not predictive of future tax rates. Our ETR differs from the statutory rate due to statutory depletion in excess of tax basis, PPP loan forgiveness, return to provision adjustments, and changes in the valuation allowance.  The deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in income before income taxes.   We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain federal and state NOL carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this, we have provided a valuation allowance of $4.7 million and $1.3 on the deferred tax assets related to these state NOL carryforwards as of  December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.   We have analyzed our filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions, to determine whether the positions will be more likely than not be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are not recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. We identified our federal tax return and our Indiana state tax return as “major” tax jurisdictions. We believe that our income tax filing positions and deduction will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our consolidated financial position. While not material, we record any penalties and interest as general and administrative expense.   Tax returns filed with the IRS and state entities generally remain subject to examination for three years after filing.   At  December 31, 2021, we had approximately $125 million and $158 million of federal and Indiana net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”), respectively. These NOLs are available to offset future taxable income. Federal NOLs generated in 2017 and prior years have a carryforward period of 20 years while those generated in 2018 and future years carryforward indefinitely. The federal NOLs generated in pre-2018 years of $56 million can offset 100% of the current years' taxable income.  The federal NOLs generated in post 2017 years of $69 million can offset 80% of current years' taxable income.  The pre-2018 federal NOLs will expire in varying amounts from 2035 to 2037 if they are not utilized. Indiana NOLs have a 20-year carryforward period and will expire in the years 2034 to 2041 if they are not utilized.

            57
  
  Vested shares had a value of $0.7 million for 2021, and $0.2 million for 2020, on their vesting dates.   Under our RSU plan, participants are allowed to relinquish shares to pay for their required statutory income taxes.   The outstanding RSUs have a value of $0.7 million based on the  March 21, 2022 closing stock price of $3.74.   For the years ended  December 31, 2021 and 2020 stock-based compensation was $1.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively. For 2022 and 2023, based on existing RSUs outstanding, stock-based compensation expense is estimated to be $0.2 million each year.   Stock Options 
   We have no stock options outstanding.   Stock Bonus Plan 
   Our stock bonus plan was authorized in late 2009 with 250,000 shares. Currently, we have 86,383 shares available for future issuance. 

 (10)  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
   We have no defined benefit pension plans or post-retirement benefit plans. We offer our employees a 401(k) Plan, where we match 100% of the first 4% that an employee contributes and a discretionary Deferred Bonus Plan for certain key employees. We also offer health benefits to all employees and their families. We have 2,274 participants in our employee health plan. The plan does not cover dental, vision, short-term or long-term disability. These coverages are available on a voluntary basis. We bear some of the risk of our employee health plans. Our health claims are capped at $200,000 per person with a maximum annual exposure of $16.6 million not including premiums.   Our employee benefit expenses for the years ended  December 31 are below (in thousands):    
 | 2021 | | 2020 | 
------------------------------------+------+--------+------+--
Health benefits, including premiums | $ | 13,084 | | $ | 13,173
401(k) matching | | 1,946 | | | 1,797 
Deferred bonus plan | | 698 | | | 679 
Total | $ | 15,728 | | $ | 15,649

           58
  
  Of the amounts in the above table, $15.2 million and $15.0 million are recorded in operating costs and expenses for 2021 and 2020, respectively with the remainder in SG&A.   Our mine employees are also covered by workers’ compensation and such costs for 2021 and 2020, were approximately $2.9 million and $1.9 million, respectively, and are recorded in operating costs and expenses. Workers’ compensation is a no-fault system by which individuals who sustain work-related injuries or occupational diseases are compensated. Benefits and coverage are mandated by each state which includes disability ratings, medical claims, rehabilitation services, and death and survivor benefits. We are partially self-insured for such claims, however, our operations are protected from these perils through stop-loss insurance policies. Our maximum annual exposure is limited to $1 million per occurrence with a $4 million aggregate deductible. Based on discussions and representations from our insurance carrier, we believe that our reserve for our workers’ compensation benefits is adequate. 

 (11)  LEASES    We have operating leases for office space and processing facilities with remaining lease terms ranging from less than one year to approximately five years. As most of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, we calculated the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities using our secured incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date. We currently do not have any finance leases outstanding.   Information related to leases was as follows as of  December 31 (in thousands):

    At  December 31, 2021, we had approximately $424,000 right-of-use operating lease assets recorded within “buildings and equipment” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 


 (12)  SELF INSURANCE 
   We self-insure our underground mining equipment. Such equipment is allocated among seven mining units dispersed over 10 miles. The historical cost of such equipment was approximately $260 million and $269 million as of  December 31, 2021 and  December 31, 2020, respectively.      Restricted cash of $3.3 million and $4.0 million as of  December 31, 2021, and  December 31, 2020, respectively, represents cash held and controlled by a third party and is restricted for future workers’ compensation claim payments.         59 (13)  NET LOSS PER SHARE 
   We compute net loss per share using the two-class method, which is an allocation formula that determines net loss per share for common stock and participating securities, which for us are our outstanding RSUs.   The following table (in thousands, except per share amounts) sets forth the computation of net loss per share:

 (14)  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
   We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:   Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. We consider active markets as those in which transactions for the assets or liabilities occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Our marketable securities are Level 1 instruments.   Level 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. We have no Level 2 instruments.   Level 3: Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources (i.e., supported by little or no market activity). Our Level 3 instruments are comprised of fuel hedges, interest rate swaps, and impairment measurements. The fair values of our hedges and swaps were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward fuel prices and interest-rate yield curves. The notional values of our two interest rate swaps were $53 million and $31 million as of  December 31, 2021, both with maturities of  May 2022.  Although we utilize third-party broker quotes to assess the reasonableness of our prices and valuation, we do not have sufficient corroborating market evidence to support classifying these assets and liabilities as Level 2. The Company also recorded impairments during Q3 of 2021 and Q4 of 2021 which incorporate Level 3 non-recurring fair value measures as further discussed in Note 2.  Certain properties' asset retirement obgligation liabilities use Level 3 non-recurring fair value measures which are discussed in Note 1.
   The following table summarizes our financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis at fair value at  December 31, 2021 and 2020 by respective level of the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):

 (15)  EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS 
   Sunrise Energy, LLC 
   We own a 50% interest in Sunrise Energy, LLC, which owns gas reserves and gathering equipment with plans to develop and operate such reserves. Sunrise Energy also plans to develop and explore for oil, gas, and coal-bed methane gas reserves on or near our underground coal reserves. The carrying value of the investment included in our consolidated balance sheets as of  December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $3.5 million and $3.2 million, respectively.   Sunrise Energy plans to develop and explore for oil, gas, and coal-bed methane gas reserves on or near our underground coal reserves.   (16)  HOURGLASS SANDS
   In  February 2018, we invested $4 million in Hourglass Sands, LLC (Hourglass), a frac sand mining company in the State of Colorado. We own 100% of the Class A units and are consolidating the activity of Hourglass in these statements. Class A units are entitled to 100% of profit until our capital investment and interest is returned, then 90% of profits are allocated to us with remainder to Class B units. We do not own any Class B units.   In  February 2018, a Yorktown company associated with one of our directors also invested $4 million in Hourglass in return for a royalty interest in Hourglass. This investment coupled with our $4 million investment brings the initial capitalization of Hourglass to $8 million. We report the royalty interest as a redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets. A representative of the Yorktown company holds a seat on the board of managers, and, with a change of control, the Yorktown company  may be entitled to receive a portion of the net proceeds realized, as prescribed in the Hourglass operating agreement.   In  December 2019, we recorded an impairment to Hourglass Sands of $2.9 million.  In  August 2020, we ceased operation of the plant and recorded an additional impairment of $1.8 million. See Note 2 to these consolidated financial statements for further discussion.   (17)  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
   As announced in our Form 8-K filed on  February 18, 2022, on  February 14, 2022, Hallador Energy Company, through its subsidiary Hallador Power Company, LLC, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") to acquire Hoosier Energy’s 1-Gigawatt Merom Generating Station, located in Sullivan County, Indiana, in return for assuming certain decommissioning costs and environmental responsibilities. The transaction, which includes a 3.5-year power purchase agreement (PPA), is scheduled to close in mid- July 2022 upon obtaining required governmental and financial approvals.   On  March 25, 2022, we executed an amendment to our credit agreement with PNC as discussed in Note 5 to these consolidated financial statments.
