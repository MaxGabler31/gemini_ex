Recent Developments:
 
September 2022 Financing
 
On September 15, 2022, the Company entered into a underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Maxim Group LLC and Joseph Gunnar & Co., LLC, as representative of the several underwriters identified therein (collectively, the “Underwriters”), relating to a firm commitment public offering of (a) 30,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock and (b) Warrants (“September 2022 Warrants”) to purchase up to 30,000,000 shares of Common Stock, at an exercise price of $0.25 per share, at an aggregate price of $0.25 per share and accompanying Warrant (the “September 2022 Offering”). Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Company granted the Underwriters a 45-day option an option to purchase up to an additional 4,500,000 of Common Stock (the “September 2022 Overallotment Common Stock”) and/or Warrants (the “September 2022 Overallotment Warrants”) (collectively, the “September 2022 Overallotment”). The closing of the offering took place on September 19, 2022.
 
The gross proceeds received from the sale of the shares of the Common Stock and September 2022 Warrants in the September 2022 Offering, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company and before any overallotment, was $7,500,000.
 
The underwriters exercised their option for 3,600,000 September Overallotment Warrants, at a purchase price of $0.01 per warrant, with an exercise price of $0.25 per warrant. Total proceeds from the September 2022 Overallotment Warrants was $36,000.
 
The Company remitted to the Holder of the Senior Convertible Note an amount of $2,265,928 equal to fifty percent (50%) of all net proceeds above $2,000,000 following the payment of 7% in offering fees including Underwriting discounts and commissions. In addition, as part of the September 2022 Offering, the Holder purchased $512,500 of securities (2,050,000 shares of Common Stock and 2,050,000 Warrants) and the Company paid the Holder an additional $512,500. The proceeds remitted to the Holder of the Senior Convertible Note reduced the principal balance of the Senior Convertible Note on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
 
The net proceeds received by the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company and amounts remitted to the Holder of the Senior Convertible Note was $4,080,990.
 
The shares of Common Stock and the September 2022 Warrants, including the 2022 Overallotment Warrants, sold by the Company have been registered pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-252370), which the SEC declared effective on February 5, 2021. A final prospectus supplement and accompanying base prospectus relating to the offering were filed with the SEC on September 19, 2022.
 
The Company does not intend to list the September 2022 Warrants, including the 2022 Overallotment Warrants, sold in the offering on any securities exchange or other trading market.
 
On September 19, 2022, prior to the closing of the offering, the Company entered into a warrant agency agreement (the “Warrant Agency Agreement”) with Vstock Transfer, LLC (“Vstock”), to serve as the Company’s warrant agent for the September 2022 Warrants, including September 2022 Overallotment Warrants. Upon the closing of the offering. The September 2022 Warrants, including September 2022 Overallotment Warrants are exercisable upon issuance and expire five years from the date they first became exercisable.
 
Sale of Helix Assets
 
On June 10, 2022, the Company entered into and consummated the transaction contemplated by that certain asset purchase agreement by and between the Company and SCV CAPITAL, LLC (the “Buyer”) pursuant to which the Buyer agreed to acquire from the Company the Helix assets related to the Company’s ownership and operation of esports game centers in Foxboro, MA and North Bergen, NJ, herein referred to as the “Helix Game Centers”. The total purchase price for the Helix Game Centers was approximately $1,200,000, with the purchase price being primarily attributable to the Buyer’s assumption of certain liabilities related to the Helix Game Centers, including leases and sponsorship liabilities. Our gain on sale of $1,069,262 was driven by the amounts of liabilities assumed by the Buyer.
Potential Sale of Spanish iGaming Operations
 
On June 15, 2022, the Company signed a non-binding letter of intent to sell its Spanish iGaming operations, including its Spanish iGaming license, as part of its strategy to focus on its core brand assets.
Regulatory Developments
 
United Kingdom
 
Since the acquisition of the Argyll iGaming business on July 31, 2020, the Company has been responding to periodic requests for information from the UK Gambling Commission (“UKGC”) in relation to information required to maintain its UK license following the change of corporate control. The Company continues to operate in the UK market and there have been no adverse judgments imposed by the UKGC against the Company. In recent months, the Company has reduced its spending on marketing and has been focused on retaining existing customers and reactivating past customers. We believe these efforts will have a positive effect on our results of operations.

Netherlands
 
On October 1, 2021, a new licensing regime was implemented in the Netherlands for online gaming operators. This resulted in the Company discontinuing its iGaming operations in this market in the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021 (Q2 of fiscal year 2022). The sole period in which the Company had revenues from its iGaming operations in the Netherlands was in the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2021 (Q1 of fiscal year 2022). As a result of these regulatory developments in the Netherlands, net revenues for our Bethard Business (as define below) declined from approximately $5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 to approximately $3.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. Net revenues for our Bethard business represented approximately 35% and 24% of our total net revenues for, respectively, the three months ended September 30, 2021 and three months ended December 31, 2021. The Company may re-enter the Dutch market in the second half of fiscal year 2023.
Finland
 
On January 1, 2022, amendments to the Finnish Lotteries Act came into effect, further restricting marketing opportunities and enhancing the enforcement powers of the Finnish regulator. Prior to these amendments coming into effect, in the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021, the Company received a communication from the Finnish regulator requesting clarification on its marketing and gaming practices related to its Finnish iGaming operations. The Company responded to the communication in Q3 of fiscal year 2022 and changed its business operations in Finland as of the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2022 as part of its response.
 

Further powers allowing the Finnish regulator to require blocking by payment service providers of overseas operators who are targeting their marketing activities towards Finnish customers are also expected to come into effect in the calendar year starting January 1, 2023. The Company believes that the changes that it has made to its business operations in Finland will allow it to avoid being adversely affected by the Finnish regulator’s new powers.
 
While there have been no adverse judgments imposed by the Finnish regulator against the Company, as a result of these Finnish regulatory developments, we estimate that net revenues for our Lucky Dino business have declined from approximately $6.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 to approximately $4.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Net revenues for our Lucky Dino business represented approximately 42% of our consolidated net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2022.
 
Operations in Finland run under the Malta Gaming Authority (“MGA”) license on the Lucky Dino in-house built iDefix casino-platform. The Company continues to launch new brands and offer new products on its various sites tailoring the experience towards each of its markets including new markets in Central America and South America. We believe revenues will be generated by these new brands and new products.
 
Compliance with Nasdaq Listing Requirements
 
On April 11, 2022, the Company received a deficiency notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (the “Nasdaq”) indicating that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) because the bid price for the Company’s Common Stock had closed below $1.00 per share for the previous 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has 180 calendar days from the date of such notice, or until October 10, 2022, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.

In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), the Company has 180 calendar days, or until December 5, 2022, to regain compliance. The notice states that to regain compliance, the Company’s MVLS must close at $35 million or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days (or such longer period of time as the Nasdaq staff may require in some circumstances, but generally not more than 20 consecutive business days) during the compliance period ending December 5, 2022. As of October 13, 2022, we have not yet regained compliance with the $35 million MVLS requirement.
 
On October 11, 2022 the Company received a letter from Nasdaq that the Company’s Common Stock will be delisted, and the Company’s Common Stock warrants traded under the symbols GMBLW and GMBLZ and the Company’s 10% Series A cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock traded under symbol GMBLP will no longer qualify for listing, and in that regard trading of the Company’s Common Stock, Common Stock warrants and 10% Series A cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock will be suspended at the opening of business on October 20, 2022, if we have not requested an appeal. The Company is eligible to request an appeal of the delisting determination. Under Nasdaq rules, while any appeal is pending, the suspension of trading of the Company’s Common Stock, warrants and 10% Series A cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock will be stayed and will continue to trade on Nasdaq until the Nasdaq hearing panel makes a determination after the hearing.

March 2022 Offering
 
On March 2, 2022, the Company closed an offering (the “March 2022 Offering”) in which it sold 15,000,000 units at $1.00 consisting of one share of Common Stock and one warrant for a total of 15,000,000 warrants with an exercise price of $1.00 (the “March 2022 Warrants”). The March 2022 Offering provided net cash proceeds of $13,605,000. Under the terms of the related underwriting agreement, there was also an overallotment option to purchase up to 2,250,000 shares of Common Stock and/or March 2022 Warrant (such overallotment March 2022 Warrants, the “April 2022 Overallotment Warrants”) with an exercise price of $1.00 issued to the underwriters of the offering.

The Company received net proceeds of $20,925. The March 2022 Warrants, including the April 2022 Overallotment, trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol GMBLZ.
Senior Convertible Note
 
On June 2, 2021, the Company issued a senior convertible note (the “Old Senior Convertible Note”) before it was exchanged for a new senior convertible note (the “Senior Convertible Note” or “New Note”) on February 22, 2022. The Old Senior Convertible Note was issued to the lender (the “Holder”) in the principal amount of $35,000,000 with the Company receiving proceeds at issuance of $32,515,000, net of debt issuance costs of $2,485,000. The Old Senior Convertible Note would have matured on June 2, 2023, at which time the Company would have been required to repay the original principal balance and a minimum return (“Premium on Principal”) equal to 6% of any outstanding principal. The aggregate principal of the Old Senior Convertible Note repayable at maturity was $37,100,000.
 
On February 22, 2022, the Company agreed to enter into an exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with the Holder whereby the Old Senior Convertible Note of the Company, with a remaining principal amount of $29,150,001, was exchanged for the New Note in the aggregate principal amount of $35,000,000.
 
The New Note is convertible, at the option of the Holder, into shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion price of $17.50 per share.
 
If an Event of Default (as defined in the New Note) has occurred under the New Note, the Holder may elect to alternatively convert the New Note at the Alternate Conversion Price (as defined in the New Note). In connection with an Event of Default, the Holder may require us to redeem in cash any or all of the New Note. The redemption price will equal 100% of the outstanding principal of the New Note to be redeemed, and accrued and unpaid interest and unpaid late charges thereon, or an amount equal to market value of the shares of our Common Stock underlying the New Note, as determined in accordance with the New Note, if greater. The Holder will not have the right to convert any portion of a New Note, to the extent that, after giving effect to such conversion, the Holder (together with certain related parties) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the shares of our Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion. The Holder may from time to time increase this limit to 9.99%, provided that any such increase will not be effective until the 61st day after delivery of a notice to us of such increase. From and after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Interest Rate shall automatically be increased to 12.0% per annum. The Company is currently in default and the Holder has not yet elected to alternatively convert.
 
In addition, unless approval of our stockholders as required by Nasdaq is obtained, the Company is prohibited from issuing any shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the New Note or otherwise pursuant to the terms of the New Note, if the issuance of such shares of Common Stock would exceed 19.99% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock or otherwise exceed the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock which the Company may issue without breaching our obligations under the rules and regulations of Nasdaq.
 
Under the New Note, and consistent with the Old Senior Convertible Note, the Company is subject to certain customary affirmative and negative covenants regarding the incurrence of indebtedness, the existence of liens, the repayment of indebtedness, the payment of cash in respect of dividends, distributions or redemptions, and the transfer of assets, among other matters. The Company is also subject to certain financial covenants relating to available cash, our ratio of debt to market capitalization and minimum cash flow. The Company is also subject to financial covenants as it relates minimum revenues that commenced on June 30, 2022. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company was in default with regards to the debt covenants of the New Note and the Holder may request the Company to begin paying monthly cash interest at a default rate of 12%. The Holder has not elected at this time to require us to redeem any portion or the principal balance of the New Note for cash or to convert any portion or the principal balance of the New Note into shares of Common Stock.

It was previously determined that the Company was not in compliance with the Old Senior Convertible Note covenants at September 30, 2021 and subsequent reporting dates. The Company therefore requested and received a waiver dated October 13, 2021 for (i) any known breaches or potential breaches of financial covenants in effect related to the available cash test and minimum cash flow test through December 25, 2021, (ii) any known breach resulting from the placement of a lien on the outstanding share capital of Prozone Limited, the entity that holds the assets of Bethard, and (iii) any known breach which would result from the Company’s announcement that it would purchase an equity interest in Game Fund Partners Group LLC through the contribution of up to 200,000 shares of Common Stock. In addition, the Company requested and received an amendment to the Old Senior Convertible Note wherein the permitted ratio of outstanding debt to market capitalization was increased temporarily from 25% to 35% through December 25, 2021.
 
In consideration for the October 13, 2021 waiver, the Company agreed to permit the conversion of up to $7,500,000 of the original principal balance of the Old Senior Convertible Note at the Alternate Conversion Price into shares of Common Stock, exclusive of the Premium on Principal and 15% premium payable that applies to an Alternate Conversion. During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Holder of the Old Senior Convertible Note had converted the full principal amount of $7,500,000 into 2,514,459 shares of Common Stock.
 
The Company also previously obtained a waiver from the Holder of the Old Senior Convertible Note on November 2, 2021 in connection with its announcement to commence an underwritten registered public offering of its 10.0% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. In consideration for this waiver, the Company agreed to increase the cash price payable upon a redemption of the Old Senior Convertible Note by the Company to be equal to 10% of the conversion amount, as defined in Old Senior Convertible Note agreement as any unpaid principal, minimum return due to the Holder, and unpaid interest due on such redemption date. The Company agreed to pay the Holder of the Old Senior Convertible Note an amount of $1,500,000 under the terms of a registration rights agreement.


During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company had not maintained compliance with the covenants of the Old Senior Convertible Note, having identified non-compliance with the same financial covenants previously identified at September 30, 2021. The Company obtained a waiver from the compliance with certain covenants, as of December 31, 2021 and through March 30, 2022. The Company further entered into a non-binding term sheet dated February 22, 2022, to restructure the New Note to mitigate the risk of default on the covenants in future periods. This term sheet expired without a new debt facility being completed. Since the expiration of the waiver on March 30, 2022, the Company is not in compliance with its covenants. The Company has not remitted payment to the Holder of an amount equal to 30% of the gross proceeds from the March 2022 Offering to be applied as a reduction of principal.
 
The New Note agreement includes provision that should the Company be in both breach of its debt covenants and its price per common share trade below the conversion floor price of $2.1832 (the “Conversion Floor Price”), the Holder may elect the Alternate Conversion option that includes a make-whole provision payable to the Holder in cash. At March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022 and through the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, both the Company was in breach of its debt covenants and the price per share of its Common Stock had declined below the Conversion Floor Price. As a result, the make-whole provision in the New Note agreement was determined to represent an obligation of the Company under the terms of the New Note.
 
At June 30, 2022, the Company estimates it would be required to issue up to 16,031,513 shares of Common Stock under the Alternate Conversion make-whole provision of the New Note. At June 30, 2022, the Company also estimates the fair value of the derivative liability, which gives effect to the cash amount payable to the Holder under the Alternate Conversion make-whole provisions of the New Note, to be $9,399,620. While the Company records a derivative liability at each reporting period for the amount contingently payable to the Holder under the Alternate Conversion make-whole provision, a strict application of the formula in the New Note indicates the cash liability to the Holder may be materially higher than the derivative liability. A calculation of the cash liability due to the Holder under the Alternate Conversion make-whole provision of the New Note indicated a liability of approximately $180,000,000 at June 30, 2022.
 
The derivative liability amount recognized by the Company for its obligation to the Holder under the Alternate Conversion make-whole provision of the New Note is subject to material fluctuation at each reporting date. The output of the Monte Carlo model that is used to estimate the fair value of the derivative liability will fluctuate based on the Company’s share price, market capitalization, estimated enterprise value, and the Company’s estimate of credit and non-performance risk.
 
Subsequent to year end, on September 19, 2022, as part of the September 2022 Offering (see below), the Company remitted to the Holder of the Senior Convertible Note an amount of $2,265,928 equal to fifty percent (50%) of all net proceeds above $2,000,000 following the payment of 7% in offering fees including Underwriting discounts and commissions. In addition, as part of the September 2022 Offering, the Holder purchased $512,500 of securities (2,050,000 shares of Common Stock and 2,050,000 Warrants) and the Company paid the Holder an additional $512,500. The proceeds remitted to the Holder of the Senior Convertible Note reduced the principal balance of the Senior Convertible Note on a dollar-for-dollar basis.

At-the Market Equity Offering Program
 
On September 3, 2021, the Company entered “at the market” equity offering program (“ATM”), to sell up to an aggregate of $20,000,000 of Common Stock. The shares were issued pursuant to the Company’s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-252370) and the Company filed a prospectus supplement, dated September 3, 2021 with the SEC in connection with the offer and sale of the shares pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement with the broker. The Company sold an aggregate of 1,165,813 shares through the ATM through September 2, 2022, for gross proceeds of $4,005,267. The agreement between the Company and Maxim Group LLC governing the ATM expired on September 3, 2022. At this time, the Company does not plan on entering into a new ATM agreement.
Bethard Acquisition
 
On July 13, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the business-to-consumer operations of Bethard that provides sportsbook, casino, live casino and fantasy sport betting services with gaming licenses to customers in Sweden, Spain, Malta and Ireland (“Bethard” or the “Bethard Business”), from Gameday Group Plc, a limited liability company incorporated in Malta (the “Seller”). The acquisition included (i) the brand names of the Bethard Business (Bethard, Fastbet, Betive and Betzerk); (ii) domains relating to the brands acquired; (iii) the customer databases relating to the acquired brands; (iv) website content, materials and code pertaining to the domains acquired; and (v) certain licensee rights under an ambassador agreement. The Company acquired licenses for operating in Sweden, Spain, Malta and Ireland.
 
The acquisition of Bethard expanded the iGaming operations of the Company in Europe and provided the Company with increased opportunity to cross-sell its esports offerings to a larger customer base. The acquisition of Bethard resulted in the Company acquiring the outstanding share capital of Prozone Limited, a public liability company registered in Malta, which had previously received the assets of Bethard in a pre-closing restructuring by the Seller. The initial payment of purchase consideration for Bethard included cash paid at closing in an amount equal to €13,000,000 (equivalent to $15,346,019 using exchange rates in effect at the acquisition date), including €1,000,000 (equivalent to $1,180,463 using exchange rates in effect at the acquisition date) paid for a regulatory deposit with the Spanish Gaming Authority. The cash purchase consideration of Bethard also included a second payment (“Second Payment”) of €4,000,000 (approximately $4,721,852 using exchange rates in effect at the acquisition date) that was paid by the Company on November 16, 2021, using the proceeds raised from the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock (see Note 15 for discussion of the 10% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock). The total purchase consideration of Bethard also requires the Company to pay additional contingent cash consideration during the 24-month period following the acquisition date equal to 15% of net gaming revenue until the November 16, 2021, with the percentage then decreasing to 12% of net gaming revenue for the remaining term ending July 2023. The total purchase consideration also provides for a payment of up to €7,600,000 (equivalent to $8,971,519 using exchange rates in effect at the acquisition date) of contingent share consideration should a specific ambassador agreement be successfully assigned to the Bethard Business acquired by the Company following the acquisition date.

In connection with the pre-closing restructuring, Prozone also entered into agreements with the Seller that included (i) a white label platform licensing agreement (“White Label Agreement’), (ii) a turnkey platform licensing agreement (“Turnkey Agreement”), and (iii) a services agreement whereby the Seller will provide transitional and support services to Prozone during a 24-month period following the acquisition. Pursuant to the terms of the White Label Agreement and/or the Turnkey Agreement, Prozone has agreed to operate for a minimum period of 24 months utilizing the Seller’s platform. After 24 months, Prozone shall be free to terminate the White Label Agreement and/or Turnkey Agreement (as applicable) and migrate any domains and customer databases acquired to another platform of Prozone’s choice. The Seller agreed to ensure that each of the licenses acquired by the Company and included in the acquisition of the Bethard Business will be transferred or subsequently granted to the Company, subject to such transfers being permitted under the relevant local regulations. The transfers and grants of licenses has been completed in readiness for the transition and migration.

We were granted approval to operate pursuant to the transactional waiver issued by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (‘‘DGE’’) on January 21, 2022.
 
As noted above in recent developments, on June 15, 2022, the Company signed a non-binding letter of intent to sell its Spanish iGaming operations, including its Spanish iGaming license, as part of its strategy to focus on its core brand assets.

EEG Games:
 
EEG Games’ focus is on providing esports entertainment experiences to gamers through a combination of (1) our proprietary infrastructure software, GGC, which underpins our focus on esports and is a leading provider of local area network (“LAN”) center management software and services, enabling us to seamlessly manage mission critical functions such as game licensing and payments, 2) online tournaments (through our EGL tournament platform), and 3) player-vs-player wagering (through our yet to be released Betground our proprietary wagering product). Currently, we operate our esports EEG Games business in the United States and Europe.
 
We believe that as the size of the market and the number of esports enthusiasts continues to grow, so will the number of esports enthusiasts who gamble on events, which we believe would increase the demand for our platform.


Competitive Advantages/Operational Strengths
 
The online gambling and wagering industry is increasingly competitive. With relatively low barriers to entry, new competitors are entering the esports wagering and video game tournament segments. In both of these segments, there currently exist several major competitors. Most of EEG’s current competitors, including bet365, William Hill, Betway, Penn National Gaming, Inc., Pinnacle Sports, PointsBet Holdings Limited., DraftKings Inc., Rush Street Interactive, Inc., Kindred Group plc, Flutter Entertainment plc, Betsson AB, Super Group (SGHC) Limited, 888 Holdings plc, and Entain Plc, have far greater resources than us.
 
However, we believe the following strengths position us for sustainable growth:
 
Management Team and Key Personnel Experience:
 
EEG’s Board of Directors includes senior managers with extensive experience in online gambling, esports, information technology, compliance, regulation, accounting and finance.
 
EEG’s officers and management include individuals with extensive experience in online gambling, esports, information technology, marketing, business development, payment processing, compliance, regulation, accounting, finance and customer service.
Unique Positioning within Digital Gaming:
 
EEG was one of the first digital gaming companies with an esports-first focus and a line of esports businesses; leading the effort to broaden legislation for betting on esports competitions. We are uniquely focused on connecting to customers across a broad set of retail and digital businesses to achieve greater revenue, scale, and profitability, as well as shaping esports infrastructure to facilitate omni-channel betting.

● | Lucky Dino’s online casino platform – iDefix, a modern online casino platform licensed in Malta, upon which the Lucky Dino’s online casino brands operate. iDefix provides a full technical solution for casino operations, with various management tools as well as in-depth business intelligence reporting and analysis. The technology is built on a scalable event-driven micro-services-based architecture offering advanced automation features including anti money laundering compliance and know your customer (“KYC”) handling, responsible gambling management and monitoring, fraud and bonus abuse detection, as well as gamification, customer relationship management and bonus management. 
● | Argyll’s proprietary sports betting rewards and bonus efficiency technology provides an industry-leading customer loyalty program (the “Program”), driving above industry customer retention rates and player lifetime values.

Strong Brand Partnerships:
 
EEG has partnered, with various leading brands in pro sports, including football, hockey, basketball and soccer, with an aggregate fanbase of over 50 million, as well as with several individual social media influencers.
Growth Strategy
 
In the future, we intend to:
 

● | Expand our esports services into more of the 45 states where skill-based gambling is legal, enhance our product offering, as well as create relationships with players that will migrate into our Vie.gg real-money wagering platform. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Expand our esports wagering services into more jurisdictions, utilizing the MGA gaming license, which provides opportunity for access into over 180 countries, as well as the recent multi-year partnership with Bally’s Corporation, for our proprietary mobile sports betting product in New Jersey. 
● | Continue with our mergers and acquisitions strategy in the iGaming and Traditional Sports Betting space, to acquire profitable operators in different jurisdictions, that will also allow for cross-pollination of services (Sportsbook, Casino and Esports). 

Future Products and Services:
 
Online Esports Tournament Play
 
EEG intends to offer players from around the world, including the United States (unless prohibited in a state or international jurisdiction) the ability to enter and participate in online video game tournaments and win cash prizes, via our enhanced EGL tournament platform. Online esports tournament play consists of two or more people playing against each other in a game from their personal phones or computers, where such players do not necessarily have to be playing in real time. These events could be held over the course of a day, a week or even a month and the winner will be the one with the top score or the fastest time at the conclusion of the event. Cash-based tournaments involving games of skill are not considered gambling in most U.S. states because the generally accepted definition of gambling involves three specific things: (1) the award of a prize, (2) paid-in consideration (meaning entrants pay to compete) and (3) an outcome determined on the basis of chance. As a result, games of skill are not generally subject to the same laws and regulations as our esports event wagering service. We expect participants in our tournaments being able to enter and play against each other with prize money distributed to the last remaining competitors. We anticipate collecting a tournament entry fee for our tournaments, as well as a percentage of total winnings that are paid to users (typically 10% of the entry fees) and thus none of their money will be at risk or otherwise dependent on the outcome. We intend to offer users a wide selection of video games of skill to be played online for real money in groups, both large and small, or major tournaments. We believe using the tournament platform to penetrate the US market will allow us to grow our brand within the esports community.

International Market Expansion
 
EEG received a gaming service license for online betting from the MGA in April 2020, and in February 2021, established a brick-and-mortar office and commenced online gaming operations in Malta. The Bethard brand acquisition added additional Spanish and Swedish licenses, in addition to the UK and Irish licenses that the Company already operated under. In order to effectively penetrate international markets, we translated our website into several additional languages and offer customer service and technical support in the local language of key markets.
EEG’s Online Wagering Platforms
 
According to Zion Market Research’s, the online gambling market represents one of the fastest growing segments of the gambling industry. Zion Market Research estimated the size of the global online gambling market in 2021 was in excess of $61.5 billion and is projected to reach $114.4 billion by 2028.
 
iDefix, the Company’s modern online casino platform that the Lucky Dino online casino brands operate on is licensed in Malta. iDefix provides a full technical solution for casino operations, with various management tools as well as in-depth business intelligence reporting and analysis. The Argyll brands and the Bethard brands operate on SB Tech and offer online users traditional casino style games such as roulette, blackjack, or slots, as well as offering online wagering on traditional sporting events such as soccer, horse racing and football.
 
On the Vie.gg esports-focused wagering platform, a player can place a bet on a team participating in any number of approved tournaments, which are scheduled to be held in the upcoming weeks. The website also maintains a “how to play” section on the website which provides players with instructional videos on placing bets as well as other pieces of information that may be beneficial to an inexperienced player or a new user of our website. Additionally, the website includes a “frequently asked questions” section which provides customers with the ability to easily navigate general questions relating to the website, personal account information, payment processing and betting rules and procedures.
 
Marketing and Sales Initiatives
 
The Company has several sponsorship marketing agreements in place for its website.
 
EEG is looking to expand into new geographic territories by obtaining licenses to operate in those territories. The need for hands-on implementation in these territories and support will require investment in additional marketing activities, offices, and other overhead.
 
We will also accelerate our expansion if we find complementary businesses that we are able to acquire in other markets. Marketing efforts to expand into new territories have included esports team and tournament sponsorship, affiliate marketing, social media advertising, content creation, and attendance at esports and gaming events in addition to personal contact with other industry leaders.
 
We plan to increase our marketing efforts and awareness of our brands through our existing suite of websites, as well as future offerings by:
 

● | Educating sports betting consumers and gamers to bet on esports; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Sponsoring professional esports teams and tournaments that have a global reach;

Further, we intend to continue to invest in optimizing the Company’s website in an effort to become the premier esports gaming and gambling website in the industry.
 
Regulations Affecting our Business
 
The offering and operation of online real-money gambling platforms and related software and solutions is subject to extensive regulation and approval by various national, federal, state, provincial, tribal and foreign agencies (collectively, “gaming authorities”). Gambling laws are usually based on public policy declaration designed to protect the integrity of the gaming industry and its consumers, as well as to enhance economic development and tourism and to increase tax revenue. To accomplish these goals, gambling laws require EEG to obtain licenses or findings of suitability from gaming authorities for EEG, including each of our subsidiaries engaged in these activities, and certain of our directors, officers, employees and in some instances, significant shareholders (typically beneficial owners of more than 5% of a company’s outstanding equity unless waived as a passive institutional investor). The criteria used by gambling authorities to make determinations as to qualification and suitability of an applicant varies among jurisdictions, but generally require the submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough and sometimes lengthy investigation. Gaming authorities have broad discretion in determining whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be found suitable. Gambling authorities generally look, at a minimum, to the following criteria when determining to grant a license or finding of suitability, including (i) the financial stability, integrity and responsibility of the applicant, (ii) the quality, security and regulatory compliance of the applicant’s online real-money platform and gaming equipment and related software, as applicable, and (iii) the history and associations of the applicant. Gambling authorities may, subject to certain administrative proceeding requirements, (i) deny an application, or limit, condition, restrict, revoke or suspend any license, registration, finding of suitability or approval, and (ii) fine any person licensed, registered or found suitable or approved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, some jurisdictions explicitly prohibit gaming in all or certain forms, and we will not market our gambling services in these jurisdictions. If any director, officer or employee of EEG fails to qualify for a license or is found unsuitable (including due to the failure to submit the required documentation) by a gaming authority, EEG may deem it necessary, or be required to, sever its relationship with such person, which may include terminating the employment of any such person. Gambling authorities have the right to investigate any individual or entity having a material relationship with EEG, to determine whether such individual or entity is suitable or should be licensed to do business as a business associate of ours. In addition, certain gambling authorities monitor the activities of the entities they regulate both in their respective jurisdiction and in other jurisdictions to ensure that these entities are in compliance with local standards on a worldwide basis.
 
On May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, a 1992 law that barred state-authorized sports gambling with some exceptions and made Nevada the only state where a person could wager on the results of a single game. Since the Supreme Court’s decision, sports gambling has commenced in numerous states and many more states have enabling legislation pending. We plan to explore expansion of our esports online wagering platform into other U.S. States, at the appropriate time, and seek licenses in the United States in addition to the New Jersey license
 
The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (“UIEGA”) made it a federal offense, punishable by up to five years in prison, for a business to accept payments “in connection with the participation of another person in unlawful internet gambling.” In support of such new prohibitions, the UIGEA uses a variety of terms — some of which are ambiguous or undefined. Initially, the UIGEA broadly defines a “bet or wager” as the staking or risking by any person of something of value upon the outcome of a contest of others, a sporting event, or a game subject to chance, upon an agreement or understanding that the person or another person will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome.

Further, a “bet or wager” specifically includes a chance on a lottery or prize awarded predominantly by chance; a “scheme” as defined in Title 28, U.S.C. § 3702 relating to government-sponsored amateur or professional sports betting and, “any instructions or information pertaining to the establishment or movement of funds by the bettor or customer in, to, or from, an account with the business of betting or wagering.” While this final prohibition incorporates the term “business of betting or wagering,” that term is not specifically defined anywhere in the UIGEA. The only reference to that term comes in § 5362(2), which states the following: the term “business of betting or wagering” does not include the activities of a financial transaction provider, or any interactive computer service or telecommunications service.
 
Nonetheless, the law does contain specific prohibitions. In order to establish a violation of the UIGEA, it must be shown that:
 

1. | A “person” was engaged in the business of betting or wagering; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | That person knowingly accepted a financial instrument or proceeds thereof; and, 
3. | That instrument was accepted (by the person) in connection with the participation of another person in “unlawful Internet gambling.” 

 
In the context of this statute “unlawful Internet gambling” is defined as follows:
 
To place, receive, or otherwise knowingly transmit a bet or wager by any means which involves the use, at least in part, of the Internet where such bet or wager is unlawful under any applicable Federal or State law in the state or tribal lands in which the bet or wager is initiated, received, or otherwise made.
 
Therefore, the UIGEA only applies to online gambling transactions that are already prohibited by other state, federal, or tribal laws and thus, in order for the financial transaction to be prohibited by § 5363 of the UIGEA, the bet or wager must be “initiated, received, or otherwise made” in a place where such activity (the bet of wager) violates preexisting state, federal, or tribal law.
 
Similarly, several other laws provide federal law enforcement with the authority to enforce and prosecute gambling operations conducted in violation of underlying state gambling laws. As with UIEGA, these enforcement laws include the Illegal Gambling Business Act and the Travel Act. No violation of the UIGEA, the Illegal Gambling Business Act or the Travel Act can be found absent a violation of an underlying state law or other federal law. In addition, the Wire Act of 1961 (the “Wire Act”) provides that anyone engaged in the business of betting or wagering knowingly uses a wire communication facility for the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of bets or wagers or information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest, or for the transmission of a wire communication which entitles the recipient to receive money or credit as a result of bets or wagers, or for information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers, will be fined or imprisoned, or both. However, the Wire Act notes that it shall not be construed to prevent the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of information for use in news reporting of sporting events or contests, or for the transmission of information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on a sporting event or contest from a State or foreign country where betting on that sporting event or contest is legal into a State or foreign country in which such betting is legal. In 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) reversed its previously-issued opinion published in 2011, which stated that interstate transmissions of wire communications that do not relate to a “sporting event or contest” fall outside the purview of the Wire Act. The DOJ’s updated opinion concluded instead that the Wire Act was not limited to wagering on sporting events or contests, and that certain of its provisions apply to non-sports-related wagering activity. In June 2019, a federal district court in New Hampshire ruled that the DOJ’s new interpretation of the Wire Act was erroneous and vacated the DOJ’s new opinion. On January 20, 2021, the First Circuit reaffirmed the district court’s decision. The DOJ did not appeal to the Supreme Court. However, while a positive result, arguably the case is binding precedent only within the First Circuit, and only applies to the specific parties in the lawsuit. Accordingly, the Wire Act could still impact our ability to engage in online internet gaming in the future. See ‘Recent Developments’ section above for a discussion of specific regulation items in relevant jurisdictions.
