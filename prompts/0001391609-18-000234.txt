ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Company History
 
Music of Your Life, Inc. (hereafter, “we”, “our”, “us”, “MYL”, or the “Company”) was incorporated on January 30, 2008, in the State of Florida, as ZhongSen International Tea Company, with the principal business objective of providing sales and marketing consulting services to small to medium sized Chinese tea producing companies who wish to export and distribute high quality Chinese tea products worldwide. The Company commenced business activities in August, 2008, when it entered into a related party Sales and Marketing Agreement with Yunnan Zhongsen Group, Ltd. However, due to lack of capital, the Company was unable to implement its business plan fully. On May 31, 2013 (the “Closing Date”), the Company entered into a Merger Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Music of Your Life, Inc. (MYL Nevada) merged with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Company began its current operations as a multi-media entertainment company, producing live concerts, television shows and radio programming. The Company changed its name to Music of Your Life, Inc. effective July 26, 2013.
Operational Overview
 
Music of Your Life® is an entertainment company that currently produces live radio programming 24 hours a day, syndicated to AM, FM and HD radio stations around the country, and across the Internet. Music of Your Life® has been broadcasting since 1978, making it the longest running syndicated music radio network in the world.
 
The Company has recently launched a new subscriber based website, charging a monthly fee for commercial free music programming, and streaming video, including live concerts, and podcasts, featuring shows hosted by celebrities.
 
Terrestrial and Internet Radio Industry Revenue
 
Revenues in the radio broadcasting industry are primarily generated in three categories: (1) over the air commercials (“OTA”); (2) digital sales from on-line streaming apps, websites, and social platforms (“Digital”); and (3) subscription based sales (“Subs”). Music of Your Life now utilizes all three of these revenue models.

· | OTA revenue for 2016 crept up .09% to $14.1 billion, indicating a leveling-off in the category after several years of decline. - Radio Advertising Bureau 2016 Year-End Report;

Objectives
 
Music of Your Life’s main objective is to reach the consumer with quality content, in the vehicle and on mobile devices with its various audio and video channels of music, sports, news, and podcasts. To distinguish itself from other services, Music of Your Life will expand its list of celebrity on-air personalities to host much of this expanded programming.
 
Another Company key objective is to partner, merge, acquire and/or license the rights to third party companies with their own quality audio and video content to enhance the Music of Your Life® value.
 
Market Advantage
 
Music of Your Life® can be heard on AM, FM, and HD radio stations across the U.S., including 5 of the top 10 markets, and to more than 90 countries worldwide over the Internet. This well-established listener base gives the company a strong market advantage over the typical Internet radio service.
 
Another one of the Company’s key marketing advantages comes from its theory that the listener appreciates an interactive experience to radio with disk jockeys, or show hosts. To that advantage, Music of Your Life has been the voice of many celebrities over the years hosting their own radio shows. This, “Stars Who Play the Stars” marketing approach has proven to be an advantage for the Company’s 45-up demographic that is less interested in an on-line jukebox, such as Pandora, and more interested in a traditional, interactive radio experience.
 
Competition
 
The entertainment industry is highly competitive, and we have limited financial and personnel resources with which to compete. We expect to be at a disadvantage when competing with many firms that have substantially greater financial and management resources and capabilities. Based on the trajectory of the online streaming music industry, we believe a high degree of competition in this industry will continue for the foreseeable future.
 
While Pandora, Spotify, and Apple Music dominate the online streaming jukebox, Sirius stands-out in a small field of Internet radio services featuring DJ’s and on-air personalities that host their own shows. The Music of Your Life model is comparable to the profitable Sirius model, and unlike the failing online jukebox channels.

We believe that we can distinguish the Company from our competition by providing high quality content, and products, with competitive pricing, and compelling branding.
 
Employees
 
As of May 31, 2018, we currently have one full-time employee, Marc Angell our CEO. We currently have seven part-time and full-time independent contractors working with the management of the Company. Additionally, we are planning to hire other employees and contractors. Certain other executive positions have been identified, and we intend to fill these positions. Additional other support staff and other personnel will be hired when there is adequate capital available to do so.
 
We have undertaken preliminary investigations concerning candidates for the above positions and do not currently anticipate difficulty in filling such positions with qualified persons; however we cannot assure you that we will in fact be able to hire qualified persons for such positions when needed. Additional positions to be filled may be identified from time to time by the Company. We expect to be able to attract and retain such additional employees as are necessary, commensurate with the anticipated future expansion of our business. Further, we expect to continue to use consultants, contract labor, attorneys and accountants as necessary.
 
The loss of our CEO Marc Angell would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company. We intend to reduce this risk by obtaining key-man insurance in the event that affordable insurance coverage may be obtained. We cannot assure you that the Company will be able to obtain such insurance or that the Company will be successful in recruiting needed personnel.
