Corporate History and Overview
 
 XSport Global, Inc., formerly known as HeadTrainer, Inc. (“HeadTrainer”), was incorporated on December 10, 2012, under the laws of the State of Wyoming.  XSport Global is a leading youth and collegiate sports technology and media holding company focused on developing disruptive sports-centric technologies and related media projects around the world, where sports industries and players are highly regarded.  We seek to help athletes achieve their full potential through cognitive training, careers, genetics, recruiting and more.  Our flagship company, HeadTrainer, was established to create, develop, promote, market, produce, and distribute online/mobile application cognitive training tools initially intended for the youth, millennial, and adult sports markets.  The mobile platform was designed and developed in careful coordination with a team of professionals from the fields of science and medicine, and world-class athletes from a variety of sports.
 
  On July 2, 2018, the Company effected a three for one reverse stock split.


 
 The Company was considered a shell company until February 8, 2016 when its former Chief Executive Officer acquired the majority of voting control of the Company and adopted the business of TeleHealthCare.  On September 11, 2017, TeleHealthCare executed an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with HeadTrainer, Inc., a North Carolina corporation, and HT Acquisition Corp., a Wyoming corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of HeadTrainer, Inc. (the “Acquisition”) whereby the Acquisition was merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”) in consideration for 52,500,000 (17,500,000 post-1 for 3 reverse stock split) newly-issued shares of Common Stock of the Company (the “Merger Shares”).  As a result of the Merger, HeadTrainer became a wholly-owned subsidiary of TeleHealthCare, and following the consummation of the Merger and giving effect to the retirement of approximately 15,666,666 post-split shares (leaving approximately 7,957,666 post-split shares remaining prior to the Merger), and the sale of approximately 3,451,322 post-split shares at the Merger to accredited investors, the stockholders of HeadTrainer, Inc. became beneficial owners of approximately 61% of our issued and outstanding common stock.  As a result of the Merger, the 17,500,000 post-split newly-issued shares were issued to the pre-existing HeadTrainer shareholders for all the outstanding shares of HeadTrainer common stock.  HeadTrainer assumed net liabilities totaling $194,632, with the remaining assets and liabilities assumed by MD Capital Advisors, Inc., a Company owned by TeleHealthCare’s former CEO, in a Split-Off Agreement.  At the effective time of the Merger, our Board of Directors and officers were reconstituted by the resignation of Derek Cahill and the appointment of Bob Finigan, Maurice Durschlag and Jay Bilas.  Subsequently, on October 16, 2017, Mr. Jay Bilas resigned from our Board of Directors.

 
 At the Merger, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) to (i) change our name to HeadTrainer, Inc.; (ii) to increase the number of our authorized shares of capital stock to 510,000,000 shares, of which 500,000,000 shares shall be common stock and 10,000,000 shares shall be blank check preferred stock; and (iii) to provide that the Company may take action without a meeting on the written consent of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at such meeting.

 
 On March 22, 2018, the Board of Directors and Majority Shareholders approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to XSport Global, Inc.  Our business plan has shifted to mobile applications for athletes of all ages and all skill levels, designed to engage and improve cognitive abilities. We are focused on developing a unique, industry-leading iOS and Android cognitive training mobile device application platform called HeadTrainer that we believe is differentiated from other players in the cognitive training space with a primary focus on the youth sports markets.

 
 On August 28, 2018, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock (the “Shares”) of Shift Now, Inc., a North Carolina corporation (“Shift Now”).  The purchase price for the Shares was 700,000 shares of our Common Stock (of which 250,000 shares are contingent on Shift Now meeting certain sales targets) and $30,000 consisting of two promissory notes for $15,000 each (the “Notes”).  The first promissory note for $15,000 is to be delivered at closing and due within 12 months of the closing.  The second promissory note for $15,000 is to be delivered to the Seller no later than the 12-month anniversary of the closing and due within 12 months after issuance.  Additionally, the Company assumed the Shift Now’s existing line of credit made in favor of American National Bank in the current amount of $100,000.  Also, on August 28, 2018, the Company entered into an employment agreement (the “Employment Agreement”) with Kristi Griggs, the former principal shareholder of Shift Now (the “Employee”) to serve as Executive Vice President of the Company’s Shift Now Division.  The Employment Agreement provides that upon consummation of the Merger, Employee shall be entitled to receive a salary of $100,000 per year plus a bonus of 5% of net revenue of clients managed by Employee or 1.5% of total gross revenues of Shift Now to be paid on the last pay period of the month for the prior month’s activity.  Additionally, the Company shall issue the Employee 150,000 shares of Common Stock at the 12-month anniversary of execution of the Employment Agreement.  Employee shall receive an additional 150,000 shares of Common Stock upon the 24-month anniversary of the Employment Agreement.  The Employee may receive severance of the greater of six months’ salary or $50,000 upon termination of the Employment Agreement and shall be entitled to retain all equity ownership earned as of the date of termination.

HeadTrainer, Inc.
 
HeadTrainer was incorporated in the state of North Carolina on May 13, 2014.  It subsequently changed its original name of Head Trainer, Inc. to HeadTrainer, Inc, then subsequently to XSport Global, Inc.  HeadTrainer was established to create, develop, promote, market, produce, and distribute online/mobile application cognitive training tools initially intended for the youth, millennial and adult sports markets.  The Corporation initially intends to outsource product manufacturing, distribution and the majority of its marketing efforts. The Corporation may work in conjunction with other organizations that provide computer programming, graphic design, and marketing expertise, and/or accomplish these same tasks in-house.
 
Our Product
 
We have developed a product that consists of i) a mobile device application (“App”) that provides a suite of cognitive training exercises available in iOS and Android versions and ii) integrates into a server-based platform that can customize user experiences, track progress, provide education, and offer an administrative console for the user (the “Product”).  We are continuing to develop our Product platform with the goal that it be flexible and interesting to a wide audience.  The cognitive training tools are intended to serve primarily the youth sports market (ages 8-18) and the high sports interest market (ages 13-29) along with support for an adult category.  The exercises incorporate sports themes and were designed with graphics that appeal to the target demographic.
 
We are in development of the Product, designed to help athletes improve their cognitive abilities, with the creation and delivery of between 10 and 15 games/exercises, each of which is targeted to improve cognitive skills in one or more of five key cognitive areas.  We call these five areas Cognitive Skill Attributes (each an “CSA”) and have defined them specifically as follows:
 
  
· | Processing Speed;
--+------------------


· | Decision Making;
--+-----------------


· | Focus/Concentration;
--+---------------------


· | Visual-Spatial Awareness; and
--+------------------------------


· | Memory.
--+--------



We expect to continuously develop new games/exercises to build a library of unique experiences, and we believe that this is essential to establish an increasing set of games/exercises for users to master.
 
The overall goal of the Product is to improve cognitive reasoning, response times, associated motor skills and reaction time.  The Product will attempt to provide varying and escalating levels of difficulty to continuously challenge the users who will have a personalized training sequence presented to them based on their individual progress.  A user’s progress will be reflected in specific game/exercise scores, as well as through aggregate scores for each CSA and a computed overall score (the “XSport Global Index”).  Another anticipated feature of the Product is the ability to participate in combines called “XSport Global Contests,” which will allow users to compete against others throughout the world.  There will also be an embedded feature in the Product that will allow the accumulation of points that may be able to be exchanged for prizes, such as logo t-shirts, caps, and potentially autographed footballs or basketballs.  This feature will mostly likely need to be delivered through a web system or third party outside of the App itself.  While we believe this rewards feature is unique in the industry, more development work is required before this feature can be implemented.
 
Current cognitive training systems are generally designed for non-athletic training (i.e. where a subject is in a calm, quiet environment).  Along with traditional sight and touch cognitive training modules, the Company, by contrast, has attempted to replicate in its Product a true sporting event environment, by incorporating, for instance, outside and background noise in future releases.  By utilizing headphones with environment-specific, programmed noise, audio tracks, and prompts, the Company has created its Product with integrated audio track, sight, touch, and sound training systems that allows the athlete to train in an environment that we believe is similar to many of the stimuli that would be present in actual competition. No material product revenue has been earned to date.

Valuable Experiential Data
 
The primary goal of the Company is to provide a cognitive training platform that can become a market leader and a preferred solution for the youth sports market, high sports interest market and adults.  We believe that a future revenue source for the Company is the collection and analysis of user data.  Because we expect that our Product will have appeal to athletes, there may be an opportunity to evaluate cognitive training progress against real-world cycles for athletes, including seasonal training and injury events such as concussions.  This data could be unique and valuable to the sports and medical communities.
Target Markets
 
Our Product will be targeted at the intersection of the competitive youth sports marketplace and cognitive training solutions market.  We currently anticipate that our primary customers will be youth sports market (ages 8-18), but also believe that Millennials and adults will be key adopters as they compare our Product to other cognitive training tools.  Estimates of the market size vary, but according to data compiled by Statistic Brain, in the U.S. alone, the youth sports market (ages 5-18) is estimated to include approximately 35,000,000.  Another estimate, from Playground Professionals, claims that the youth sports market (ages 6-17) includes 50,000,000 athletes and that the youth sports industry accounts for more than $5,000,000,000 in spending annually related to sports travel and competitions.  Management believes this group is a motivated buying group seeking products and services that are perceived to improve targeted athletic performance.
 
With regard to the cognitive training market, according to a 2012 study by SharpBrains, a research firm that tracks the cognitive training market, the market for brain health software grew from $295,000,000 in annual revenues in 2009 to more than $480,000,000 at the end of 2010.  Experts estimate that the market will exceed $3,000,000,000 by 2020.  Management believes that the industry estimates predict a healthy environment for the launch of the Products.
 
We anticipate designing our products so that they are available in multiple languages to serve the international community as well as the United States.  The cognitive training exercises can be adapted to other languages, because they are not verbally intensive.  Management initially launched in English but will be exploring additional release opportunities in several countries as product acceptance accelerates.
 
Revenue Model
 
We anticipate earning revenue from our Product through a subscription-based pricing model.  The industry standard for cognitive training companies is a subscription-based model.  We examined specific pricing strategies and have not yet determined our market tolerances, but expect to test several pricing models in the beta test launch, to determine the most effective conversion rate and adoption, with additional revenue opportunities through in-game currencies and purchases through customization of avatars, etc.  We believe this competitively prices our Product in order to stimulate trials and retain users after being exposed to the training platform experience.  These price points are projected based on our analysis of standard pricing for similar products; however, there can be no assurance that these price points will be palatable to the purchasing public, and we may have to adjust these prices or develop different pricing or income strategy to attract customers.  While we currently anticipate generating our primary revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our Products, we also may earn revenue in the future from advertising and branded sponsorships, as well as strategic relationships with other sports related entities and products and other forms of revenue generation.

Marketing
 
We have worked with a variety of marketing partners, including Signature Sports Group to design a comprehensive marketing campaign to support the launch of the Product and continuing operations of the Company.  The multi-faceted program incorporates branding strategies, trademark promotion, image development and advertising materials to establish a consistent image.  Importantly, the plan included a multi-channel execution strategy designed to expose the Product to millions of potential users upon launch through endorsement-supported channels.  We believe this execution strategy will resonate with our potential users and lead to strong adoption, as long as we have the necessary cash to execute on the marketing channels and leverage the initial investment in our endorsers.  We are planning to market our Products through campaigns, leveraging formal endorsement relationships with professional athletes and sports celebrities on social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram).  We also intend to build awareness and adoption through efforts directed at youth sports events, youth sports camps, and sports academies.  We also intend to partner with high profile entities (such as professional sports franchises, major universities, leading entertainment companies, professional athletes, leading medical institutions, sports camps, and sports academies) that will help facilitate immediate brand awareness.  However, in order to successfully execute on this plan, we will need to have the necessary cash to fund the activation strategy.  Finally, the Company expects to market through more traditional public relations channels and paid digital channels. As we discover the right mix of traction channels, management will optimize the marketing mix spend such that it is generating the most efficient delivery of App downloads.
 
Some of the key elements of the Company’s marketing plan revolve around the Company delivering “premium cognitive development exercises” to users through the following:
 
  
· | The Brand/Attributes: The following brand attributes and image will be represented to the target audience – performance; elite; training; brain; science/research; sport/competition; hip/modern; global and academic. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Brand/Brand Positioning: XSport Global plans to be a brand that delivers premium cognitive development exercises specifically designed for the training of athletes to improve performance as it relates to an individual’s overall cognitive capabilities for their own competitive environment with the intent of becoming synonymous with athletic brain training. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Target Market: The key target audiences can be defined as (i) Primary market/user group – youth sports market (ages 8-18) and high sports interest market (13-29), (ii) Secondary market (Purchasers/Influencers) – Parents and Coaches of Athletes and (iii) Tertiary market – other athletes, competition and brain-training enthusiasts. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Overarching Communication Idea: Our communication idea will be the broad creative platform that brings the brand positioning to life – “Team XSport Global.” Team XSport Global plans to be comprised of a group of elite athletes, sports spokespersons, trainers, educators, sports psychologists and collegiate properties who will bring awareness, encourage trial and influence subscribers to adopt, use and promote the Product as integrated partners in our marketing strategy. Team XSport Global will represent the overall sports landscape, crossing sports, age, nationality, gender and race. Initial athlete focus will be on the core four U.S. participation team sports of soccer, baseball, basketball, and football, while also reaching out to and adding athletes participating in other action team and individual sports to ensure that every athlete feels that the Product is for them. The elite athletes and spokespersons will be expected to be at the forefront of their sports/profession, be active in social media, have crossover appeal, be great communicators, be credible and authentic to the brand and be considered as “safe” as possible with their reputation on and off the court/field. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We intend to reach the users and their influencers online and through their mobile devices and through the use of the following:
 
  
· | Social Media - Accounts of the Company and Team XSport Global members will promote and educate our target markets and the secondary and tertiary markets on the value of the Product and brain-training exercises. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Videos – We intend to highlight each member of Team XSport Global and emphasize the importance of brain training from a number of different perspectives. The videos will be produced in a socially sharable and viral format. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Website – The Company has developed an initial comprehensive, one-stop platform where users and purchasers/parents can go to get information as it relates to the Company and the importance of brain training. Supported research documentation will be available as well as information on all Team XSport Global members, our videos, step-by-step guides for the Product, testimonials, XSport Global in the News, social media links and future collegiate or sports organization associations. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cause Marketing – We currently anticipate that the Company will give back to the communities we serve by starting a cyber-bullying awareness campaign. Team XSport Global members will participate to create a powerful message on the prevalence and prevention of cyber-bullying. Our users are online, on mobile devices and social networks where they are most at risk for cyber-bullying. The campaign is expected to be viral and public relations and social-media driven. We anticipate kicking this campaign off in the 2nd or 3rd quarter of calendar 2018 in conjunction with the launch of future versions of the App. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other – Additional tactics like paid media (digital and traditional) as well as sponsorships, league associations, etc. will be continually evaluated and pursued when determined to be a good fit for the Company. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 
There are several companies that have developed cognitive training platforms and deliver their solutions via the web and/or through mobile apps.  Management believes that these early participants have educated consumers on the value proposition of cognitive training generally and have helped to pave the way for a differentiated solution from the Company.  Management believes there are several key differentiators to the Product as compared to other cognitive training programs.

· | The Product was developed with sports themes and is targeted primarily at the youth sports market, including youth ages 8-18, high sports interest ages 12-29, as well as adults. We believe that competitive, accomplished athletes in these demographics will embrace the possibility of enhancing their cognitive performance skills to get an extra edge on the competition. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Company has incorporated an audio interference/distraction component replicating life-like sporting event distractions and created a “playing” environment that features additional complicating elements to the training. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Company will leverage its existing and future endorsement contracts with professional athletes and celebrities to market the product through existing social media channels. We believe this will be one of the most cost-effective ways to reach its intended audience, but it will not be the only traction channel. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In addition to the social marketing strategies, the youth sports market will also be addressed through sports camps and dedicated sports organizations. However, the Company will need to have the necessary cash in order to activate such youth sports channels.

While it is unclear to the overall patentability of our technology, we will continue to evaluate our overall intellectual property protection and proceed with viable protection opportunities in the future.  There can be no assurances that a final utility patent will be secured, and we are cognizant of the value of protecting key business model differentiators and intends to continue to pursue protection of our intellectual property.
