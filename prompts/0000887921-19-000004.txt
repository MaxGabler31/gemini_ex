Financial Information about Operating Segments
Operating segments include components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the Company's "Chief Executive Officer") in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing the Company's performance. As a result of the similarities in the procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes for the Company’s products, much of the information provided in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and provided in the segment table below is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by the Company's Chief Executive Officer. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company implemented the brand-centric organizational structure previously announced in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on January 17, 2017. This structure is built around four global brand teams: Revlon; Elizabeth Arden; Portfolio; and Fragrances, which represent the Company's four reporting segments. As a result, segment financial data for the year ended December 31, 2017 has been recast from what was presented in previous filings and presented under the new organizational structure.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s operations continue to be organized into the following reportable segments:

Fragrances Segment:
The Company's Fragrances segment includes the development, marketing and distribution of certain owned and licensed fragrances. These products are typically sold to retailers in the U.S. and internationally, including prestige retailers, specialty stores, e-commerce sites, the mass retail channel, travel retailers and other international retailers. The owned and licensed fragrances include brands such as Juicy Couture (which are also sold direct-to-consumer on its juicycouturebeauty.com website), Britney Spears, Elizabeth Taylor, Curve, John Varvatos, Christina Aguilera, Giorgio Beverly Hills, Ed Hardy, Charlie, Lucky Brand, Paul Sebastian, Alfred Sung, Jennifer Aniston, Mariah Carey, Halston, Geoffrey Beene, La Perla, White Shoulders, AllSaints  and Wildfox.

These products are typically sold to retailers in the U.S. and internationally, including prestige retailers and specialty stores and mass retailers, including mid-tier and chain drug retailers, e-commerce sites and other international and travel retailers.
Marketing 
The Company uses various marketing techniques depending on the brand, type of product or target customer, among other variables. For its mass retail products, the Company markets its extensive product lines covering a broad range of price points within large volume retailers and e-commerce sites in the U.S. and within large volume retailers and other retailers internationally. The Company uses social media and other digital marketing, television, outdoor and print advertising and public relations and influencer marketing, as well as point-of-sale merchandising, including displays and samples, coupons and other trial incentives. The Company coordinates its marketing and advertising campaigns for new product launches and innovation with an omni-channel approach. The Company develops, jointly with retailers, customized, tailored point-of-purchase and other focused marketing programs.
The Company also uses cooperative advertising programs, Company-paid or Company-subsidized demonstrators and coordinates in-store promotions and displays. Other marketing strategies, including trial-size products and couponing, are designed to introduce the Company's newest products to consumers and encourage trial and purchase in-store.
For Elizabeth Arden products, the Company’s approach is focused on generating strong retailer and consumer demand across its key brands. The Company emphasizes a competitive marketing mix for each brand and implements plans that are designed to ensure that each brand's positioning is carried through consistently across all consumer touch points. The Company is increasingly leveraging new media, such as social networking and mobile and digital applications, along with traditional consumer reach vehicles, such as television and magazine print advertising, to engage with its consumers through their personally-preferred technologies. Marketing programs for the Company's Elizabeth Arden brands are also integrated with significant cooperative advertising programs that the Company plans and executes with its retailers, often linked with new product innovation and promotions.
For products primarily sold to professional salons and distributors, the Company markets products through educational seminars on such products' application methods and consumer benefits. In addition, the Company uses professional trade advertising, social media and other digital marketing, displays and samples to communicate to professionals and consumers the quality and performance characteristics of its products. In some countries, the Company's direct sales force provides customers with point of sale communication and merchandising for its professional products. 
The Company believes that its presence in professional salons benefits the marketing and sale of its products sold through other channels, such as mass retailers or specialty stores, as it enables the Company to improve many of its other product categories, such as hair color, hair care, nail color, nail care and skin care. The presence of regional brands internationally provides the Company with broader brand, geographic coverage and retail diversification beyond large volume retailers, among others. 
Additionally, the Company maintains many brand-specific websites, such as www.revlon.com, www.elizabetharden.com, www.almay.com, www.revlonprofessional.com, www.americancrew.com, www.cnd.com and www.mitchum.com, devoted to the Revlon, Elizabeth Arden, Almay, Revlon Professional, American Crew, CND and Mitchum brands, respectively.

Research and Development 
The Company believes that it is an industry leader in the development of innovative and technologically-advanced cosmetics and beauty products. The Company's marketing and research and development groups identify consumer needs and shifts in consumer preferences in order to develop new products, introduce line extensions and promotions and redesign or reformulate existing products to satisfy these needs and preferences. The Company's research and development group is comprised of departments specialized in the technologies critical to many of the Company's product lines. The Company also utilizes specialty laboratories and manufacturers in its supply chain for the development of certain new products, such as fragrances and skin care. The Company continues to refine its rigorous process for the ongoing development and evaluation of new product concepts, led by executives in marketing, sales, research and development, and including input from operations, law and finance. This process has created a comprehensive, long-term portfolio strategy that is intended to optimize the Company's ability to regularly launch innovative new product offerings and to effectively manage the Company’s product portfolio.
The Company operates an extensive research and development facility in Edison, New Jersey for products under brands such as Revlon, Almay and Elizabeth Arden. The Company also has research facilities for its professional products in the U.S. (in California and Florida), Spain and Mexico. The scientists at these various facilities are responsible for performing all of the Company’s research and development activities for new products, ideas, concepts and packaging. The Company’s package development and engineering function is also part of the greater research and development organization and fosters a strong synergy of package and formula development, which is integral to a product’s success. The research and development group performs extensive safety and quality testing on the Company’s products, including toxicology, microbiology, efficacy and package testing. Additionally, quality control testing is performed at each of the Company’s manufacturing facilities. 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company employed approximately 200 people in its research and development activities, including specialists in pharmacology, toxicology, chemistry, microbiology, engineering, biology, dermatology and quality control. 
Manufacturing and Related Operations and Raw Materials
During 2018, the Company’s products were primarily produced at the Company’s facilities in the U.S. (North Carolina and Florida), South Africa, Spain, Italy and Mexico, and at third-party facilities around the world. A significant portion of Elizabeth Arden products were also produced by third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers in the U.S. and Europe.
The Company continually reviews its manufacturing needs against its manufacturing capacities to identify opportunities to reduce costs and operate more efficiently. The Company purchases raw materials and components throughout the world, and continuously pursues reductions in cost of goods through the global sourcing of raw materials and components from qualified vendors, utilizing its purchasing capacity to optimize cost reductions. The Company’s global sourcing strategy for materials and components from qualified vendors is also designed to ensure that the Company maintains a continuous supply of high-quality raw materials and components. The Company believes that alternate sources of raw materials and components exist and does not anticipate any significant shortages of, or difficulty in obtaining, such materials. 
As previously disclosed, the Company's 2018 net sales were negatively impacted by service level disruptions that occurred at the Company's Oxford, N.C. manufacturing facility resulting from the Company's launch of a new SAP enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system. This launch impacted the Company's ability to manufacture certain quantities of finished goods and fulfill shipments to retail customers in the U.S. and internationally and caused the Company to incur substantial costs during 2018 to remediate the decline in customer service levels. As of December 31, 2018, the Oxford, N.C. manufacturing facility was operating at pre-SAP levels and the Company was continuing to re-fill inventories across its retail partners, particularly internationally. (See Item 1A. "Risk Factors - The Company depends on its Oxford, North Carolina facility for production of a substantial portion of its products. Disruptions at this facility and/or at other Company or third-party facilities at which the Company's products are manufactured could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.") 
Distribution
The Company's products are sold in approximately 150 countries across six continents. The Company utilizes a dedicated sales force in countries where the Company maintains operations, and also utilizes sales representatives and independent distributors to serve certain territories and retailers. (See Item 1A. "Risk Factors - The Company depends on a limited number of customers for a large portion of its net sales, and the loss of one or more of these customers could reduce the Company's net sales and have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows" and "Competition in the beauty industry could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.")

Net sales in the U.S. accounted for approximately 48% of the Company's 2018 net sales, which were made in multiple channels, including mass and prestige retail, e-commerce sites and specialty cosmetics stores. The Company also sells a broad range of beauty products to U.S. Government military exchanges and commissaries. The Company licenses its Revlon trademark to select manufacturers for complementary beauty-related products and accessories that the Company believes have the potential to extend the Company's brand names and image. The Elizabeth Arden and Red Door trademarks are also licensed to a third party for the operation of the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa beauty salons and spas. As of December 31, 2018, 9 of such licenses were in effect for 16 categories of beauty and fashion-related products and services. Pursuant to such licenses, the Company retains strict control over product design and development, product and service quality, advertising and the use of its trademarks.

The Company sells its products through the mass retail channel, prestige retailers, perfumeries, boutiques, department and specialty stores, travel retailers and distributors, as well as direct sales to consumers via its Elizabeth Arden branded retail stores and e-commerce business.

Retail merchandisers maintain the Company's point-of-sale wall displays intended to ensure that high-selling SKUs are in stock and to ensure the optimal presentation of the Company's products in retailers. Products for use in professional salons are sold primarily through wholesale beauty supply distributors in the U.S.

The three countries outside the U.S. with the highest net sales were Canada, Spain and Australia which together accounted for approximately 13% of the Company's 2018 net sales. The Company distributes its mass retail products, prestige products and fragrances through large volume retailers, chain drug and food stores, chemist shops, hypermarkets, general merchandise stores, e-commerce sites, television shopping, department and specialty stores, one-stop shopping beauty retailers, perfumeries, boutiques, travel retailers and distributors. Products for use in professional hair and nail salons are sold directly to the salons by the Company's direct sales force in countries where it has operations and through wholesale beauty supply distributors in other countries outside the U.S.
At December 31, 2018, the Company actively sold its products through wholly-owned subsidiaries established in approximately 25 countries outside of the U.S., as well as through joint ventures in Asia and the Middle East, and through a large number of independent distributors and licensees elsewhere around the world.

As is customary in the industry, none of the Company’s customers is under an obligation to continue purchasing products from the Company in the future. 
Walmart and its affiliates worldwide accounted for approximately 15% of the Company's 2018 consolidated net sales. The Company expects that Walmart and a small number of other customers will, in the aggregate, continue to account for a large portion of the Company's net sales. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors - "The Company depends on a limited number of customers for a large portion of its net sales, and the loss of one or more of these customers could reduce the Company's net sales and have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.")
