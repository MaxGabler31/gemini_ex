ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Business Overview 
 We are a global pharmaceutical company, committed to increasing access to high-quality healthcare to patients around the world. We operate worldwide, with headquarters in Israel and a significant presence in the United States, Europe and many other markets around the world. Our key strengths include our world-leading generic medicines expertise and portfolio, focused specialty medicines portfolio and global infrastructure and scale. 
 Teva was incorporated in Israel on February 13, 1944, and is the successor to a number of Israeli corporations, the oldest of which was established in 1901. 
 In November 2017, we announced a new organizational structure and leadership changes to enable strategic alignment across our portfolios, regions and functions. Under this new structure, our business will be integrated into one commercial organization, operating through three regionsNorth America, Europe and Growth Markets. Each region will manage our entire product portfolio, including generics, specialty and over-the-counter (OTC). The new structure will enable stronger alignment and integration between R&D, operations and commercial regions, allowing us to become a more agile, lean and profitable company. Prior to the implementation of our new organizational structure, we operated our business and reported our financial results in two segments: 
 

 | Generic Medicines, which includes chemical and therapeutic equivalents of originator medicines in a variety of dosage forms, such as tablets, capsules, injectables, inhalants, liquids, ointments and creams.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
2 


 
This segment includes our OTC business, a significant part of which is conducted through PGT, as well as our world-leading active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing business. We are the leading generic drug company in the United States and Europe, and we have a significant presence in certain ROW markets.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Specialty Medicines, which includes our core therapeutic areas of central nervous system (CNS) medicines such as COPAXONE and AUSTEDO® and respiratory medicines such as ProAir® and QVAR®. Our specialty medicines segment also includes other products, such as BENDEKA® and GRANIX® in oncology.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to these two segments, we have other activities, primarily sales of third-party products for which we act as distributor in the United States and in other countries. 
 For a breakdown of our revenues and profitability by segment and by geography, see Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsResults of Operations and note 20 to our consolidated financial statements. For information regarding our major customers, see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 In December 2017, we announced a comprehensive restructuring plan intended to significantly reduce our cost base, unify and simplify our organization and improve business performance, profitability, cash flow generation and productivity. The restructuring plan will focus on: 
 

 | The immediate deployment of the new unified and simplified organizational structure announced in November 2017, which will increase internal efficiencies and simplify business structures and processes across our global operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Substantial optimization of the generics portfolio globally, and most specifically in the United States, through a more tailored approach to the portfolio with increased focus on profitability, which will likely result in certain product discontinuations. This will enable us to accelerate the restructuring and optimization of our manufacturing and supply network, including the closure or divestment of a significant number of manufacturing plants around the world.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Closure or divestment of a significant number of R&D facilities, headquarters and other office locations across all geographies, delivering efficiencies and substantial cost savings.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A thorough review of all R&D programs in generics and specialty, to prioritize core projects and terminate non-essential projects, while maintaining a substantial pipeline.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to the restructuring plan, we continue to review the potential for additional divestment of non-core assets.

 Transactions 
 Certain Womens Health and Other Specialty Products 
 On January 31, 2018, we completed the sale of a portfolio of products to CVC Capital Partners Fund VI for $703 million in cash. The portfolio of products, which is marketed and sold outside of the United States, includes the womens health products OVALEAP®, ZOELY®, SEASONIQUE®, COLPOTROPHINE® and other specialty products such as ACTONEL®. 
 PLAN B ONE-STEP® and Other Womens Health Products 
 On November 2, 2017, we completed the sale of PLAN B ONE-STEP® and our brands of emergency contraception TAKE ACTION®, AFTERA® and NEXT CHOICE ONE DOSE® to Foundation Consumer Healthcare for $675 million in cash. 
 PARAGARD®
On November 1, 2017, we completed the sale of PARAGARD®, a copper releasing intrauterine contraceptive manufactured and sold in the United States, to CooperSurgical for $1.1 billion in cash. 
 AUSTEDO 
 On September, 19, 2017, we entered into a partnership agreement with Nuvelution Pharma, Inc. (Nuvelution) for development of AUSTEDO for the treatment of Tourette syndrome in pediatric patients in the United States. Nuvelution will fund and manage phase 3 clinical development, driving all operational aspects of the program. Upon successful completion of the development we will lead the regulatory approval process and be responsible for commercialization. Upon U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) approval of AUSTEDO for Tourette syndrome, we will pay Nuvelution pre-agreed compensation for their contribution to our partnership. 
Fremanezumab 
 On May 12, 2017, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Otsuka) providing Otsuka with an exclusive license to conduct phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for fremanezumab in Japan and, once approved, to commercialize the product in Japan. Otsuka paid us an upfront payment of $50 million in consideration for the transaction and we may receive additional milestone payments upon filing with Japanese regulatory authorities, receipt of regulatory approval and achievement of certain revenue targets. Otsuka will also pay us royalties on fremanezumab sales in Japan. 
Our Segments 
 Generic Medicines 
 Overview 
 Generic medicines are the chemical and therapeutic equivalents of originator medicines and are typically more affordable in comparison to the originators products. Generics are required to meet similar governmental regulations as their brand-name equivalents offered or sold by the originator, such as those relating to manufacturing processes and health authorities inspections, and must receive regulatory approval prior to their sale in any given country. Generic medicines may be manufactured and marketed if relevant patents on their brand-name equivalents (and any additional government-mandated market exclusivity periods) have expired or have been challenged or otherwise circumvented. 
 
4 


 We develop, manufacture and sell generic medicines in a variety of dosage forms, including tablets, capsules, injectables, inhalants, liquids, ointments and creams. We offer a broad range of basic chemical entities, as well as specialized product families, such as sterile products, hormones, narcotics, high-potency drugs and cytotoxic substances, in both parenteral and solid dosage forms. 
 Our generic business has a wide-reaching commercial presence. We are the market leader in the United States and have a top three leadership position in over 30 countries, including some of our key European markets. We have a robust product portfolio, comprehensive R&D capabilities, focused product pipeline and a global operational network, which will enable us to execute key generic launches to further expand our product pipeline and diversify our revenue stream. We use these capabilities to mitigate price erosion in our generics business. 
 When considering whether to develop a generic medicine, we take into account a number of factors, including our overall strategy, regional and local patient and customer needs, R&D and manufacturing capabilities, regulatory considerations, commercial factors and the intellectual property landscape. We will challenge patents when appropriate if we believe they are either invalid or would not be infringed by our generic version. We may seek alliances to acquire rights to products we do not have in our portfolio or to otherwise share development costs or litigation risks, or to resolve patent and regulatory barriers to entry. 
 As part of our comprehensive restructuring plan, we intend to conduct substantial optimization of our generics portfolio globally, and most specifically in the United States, through price adjustments and/or product discontinuation, with a focus on increasing profitability. This will enable us to accelerate the restructuring and optimization of our manufacturing and supply network, including the closure or divestment of a significant number of manufacturing plants in the United States, Europe, Israel and Growth Markets. 
 In markets such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands and Israel, generic medicines may be substituted by the pharmacist for their brand name equivalent or prescribed by International Nonproprietary Name (INN). In these so-called pure generic markets, physicians and patients have little control over the choice of generic manufacturer, and consequently generic medicines are not actively marketed or promoted to physicians. Instead, the relationship between the manufacturer and pharmacy chains and distributors, health funds and other health insurers is critical. Many of these markets have automatic substitution models when generics are available as alternatives to brands. In Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, certain Asia Pacific and Latin American countries and certain European markets, generic medicines are generally sold under brand names alongside the originator brand. These markets are referred to as branded generic markets and are generally out of pocket markets in which consumers can pay for a particular branded generic (vs. government or privately funded medical health insurance), often at the recommendation of their physician. Branded generic products are actively promoted and a sales force is necessary to create and maintain brand awareness. Other markets, such as Germany, Japan, France, Italy and Spain, are hybrid markets with elements of both approaches. 
 Our position in the generics market is supported by our global R&D function, as well as our API R&D and manufacturing activities, which provide significant vertical integration for our own products. 
 In most markets in which we operate, we use an integrated and comprehensive marketing model, offering a portfolio of generic, specialty and OTC products. 
 OTC 
 We have a global OTC business, most significantly through PGT, our consumer healthcare joint venture with P&G, formed in 2011. PGT manufactures and markets more than 200 consumer healthcare brands, including OTC medicines and vitamins, minerals and food supplements, in more than 70 countries around the world, excluding North America. Its portfolio includes the leading cough and cold brand Vicks®, Germanys leading OTC brand, RATIOPHARM®, and other leading brands. 
 
5 


 We own 49% and P&G owns 51% of PGT, which benefits from P&Gs consumer brand-building capabilities and Tevas pharmaceutical supply, regulatory and development capabilities. We are currently reviewing our relationship with P&G and are exploring options for the PGT joint venture. No decision has been finalized. 
 In addition to PGT, we manufacture and market other OTC products around the world, mostly in Europe and Russia. Our portfolio includes global brands such as SUDOCREM® as well as local and regional brands like FLUX® in Nordic countries and SPASMALGON® in Russia. 
 APIs 
 We produce approximately 300 APIs for our own use and for sale to third parties in many therapeutic areas. APIs used in pharmaceutical products are subject to regulatory oversight by national health authorities. We utilize a variety of production technologies, including chemical synthesis, semi-synthetic fermentation, enzymatic synthesis, high potency manufacturing, plant extract technology and peptide synthesis. Our advanced technology and expertise in the field of solid state particle technology enable us to meet specifications for particle size distribution, bulk density, specific surface area and polymorphism, as well as other characteristics. 
 Below is a description of our generic medicines business by the main geographic areas in which we operate: 
 United States 
 We are the leading generic drug company in the United States. We market over 500 generic prescription and OTC products in more than 1,800 dosage strengths and packaging sizes, including oral solid dosage forms, injectable products, inhaled products, liquids, ointments and creams. Most of our generic sales in the United States are made to retail drug chains, mail order distributors and wholesalers, which continue to be impacted by customer consolidation and alliances. 
 We will continue to focus our efforts in the United States in maintaining our position as an industry leader in introducing new generic equivalents for brand-name products on a timely basis, with a focus on complex generics and other high-barrier products, generating value by making these medicines more accessible to patients. We will conduct a substantial optimization of the generics portfolio globally, and most specifically in the United States, through a more tailored approach to the portfolio with increased focus on profitability. These efforts will be supported by our strong emphasis on customer service, the breadth of our product pipeline and our commitment to quality and regulatory compliance. 
 Our wholesale and retail selling efforts are supported by participating in key pharmaceutical conferences as well as focused advertising in professional journals and on leading pharmacy websites. We continue to strengthen consumer awareness of the benefits of generics through partnerships and digital marketing programs. 
 During 2017 our generics business in the United States was negatively impacted by certain developments, including: (i) additional pricing pressure as a result of customer consolidation into larger buying groups capable of extracting greater price reductions, (ii) an accelerated FDA approval process for generic versions of off-patent medicines, resulting in increased competition for these products, and (iii) delays in the launch of some of our new generic products. 
 For information about our pipeline of generic medicines in the United States, see Item 7Managements Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsSegment InformationGeneric Medicines Segment. 
 Europe 
 We define our European region as the European Union and certain other European countries. 
 
6 


 We are the leading generic pharmaceutical company in Europe. We are among the top three companies in more than 25 markets across Europe. No single market in Europe represents more than 25% of our total European generic revenues, and as a result we are not dependent on any single market that could be affected by pricing reforms or changes in public policy. In Europe, we also out-license certain generic pharmaceutical products. 
 Despite their diversity and highly fragmented nature, the European markets share many characteristics that allow us to leverage our pan-European presence and broad portfolio. Global customers are crucial partners in our generic business and are expanding across Europe, although customer consolidation is lower than it is in the United States. We are one of a few generic pharmaceutical companies with a pan-European footprint. Most competitors focus on a select few markets or business lines. 
 For information about our pipeline of generic medicines in Europe, see Item 7Managements Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsSegment InformationGeneric Medicines Segment. 
 Rest of the World Markets 
 Our ROW markets include all countries other than the United States and those included within our Europe region. The ROW is comprised of more than 25 countries, covering 40% of the global pharmaceutical market.
 Our key ROW markets are Japan, Canada and Russia. In Japan, we operate our business through a business venture with Takeda Pharmaceutical Companies Limited (Takeda), in which we own a 51% stake and Takeda owns the remaining 49%. The countries in this category include highly regulated, pure generic markets such as Canada and Israel, hybrid markets, such as Japan, and branded generics markets such as Russia, certain Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) markets, Latin American markets and Asia Pacific markets. 
 Each markets strategy is built upon differentiation and filling the unmet needs of that market. Our integrated sales force enables us to extract synergies across our branded generic, OTC and specialty medicines business segments and across various channels (e.g., retail, institutional). 
 Specialty Medicines 
 Our specialty medicines business, which is focused on delivering innovative solutions to patients and providers via medicines, devices and services in key regions and markets around the world, includes our core therapeutic areas of CNS (with a strong emphasis on MS, neurodegenerative disorders, movement disorders and pain care including migraine) and respiratory medicines (with a focus on asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)). We also have specialty products in oncology and selected other areas. 
 Between November 2017 and January 2018, we sold certain non-core specialty products, including our global womens health business. See  Transactions above. We are pursuing opportunities to sell additional non-core specialty products, which will be subject to negotiation of acceptable terms, board approval and applicable regulatory approvals. 
 Our specialty medicines organization focuses on our key therapeutic areas and selected local opportunities, with medical and sales and marketing professionals within each area who seek to address the needs of patients and healthcare professionals. We tailor our patient support, payer relations and medical affairs activities to the distinct characteristics of each therapeutic area and medicine. 
 The U.S. market is the most significant part of our specialty business. In Europe and ROW markets, we leverage existing synergies with our generics and OTC businesses. Our specialty presence in ROW markets is mainly built on our CNS franchise, with gradual development in other therapeutic areas closely related to our branded generics portfolios in those countries. 
 
7 


 We have built a specialized capability to help patients adhere to their treatments, improve patient outcomes, and in certain markets, to ensure timely delivery of medicines and assist in securing reimbursement. These programs, known as Patient Support Programs, reflect the importance we place on supporting patients and are a critical part of our success. We currently operate Patient Support Programs in 35 countries around the world in multiple therapeutic areas. We believe that we can provide a range of services and solutions appropriately tailored to meet the needs of patients according to their specific condition and local market requirements. We believe this capability provides us with an important competitive advantage in the specialty medicines market. 
 Below is a description of our key therapeutic areas, products and pipeline: 
 Central Nervous SystemMedicines 
 Our CNS portfolio, one of our two core therapeutic areas, includes COPAXONE for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, and AUSTEDO, which was launched in the United States in 2017, for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia and chorea associated with Huntington disease. 
COPAXONE 
 

 | COPAXONE (glatiramer acetate injection) is the leading MS therapy in the United States and worldwide. COPAXONE is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of MS (RMS), including the reduction of the frequency of relapses in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), including in patients who have experienced a first clinical episode and have MRI features consistent with MS.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | COPAXONE is believed to have a unique mechanism of action that works with the immune system, unlike many therapies that are believed to rely on general immune suppression or cell sequestration to exert their effect. COPAXONE provides a proven mix of efficacy, safety and tolerability.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In October 2017, the FDA approved a generic version of COPAXONE 40 mg/mL and a second generic version of COPAXONE 20 mg/mL. A hybrid version of COPAXONE 40 mg/mL was approved in the European Union.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | COPAXONE 40 mg/mL is protected by five U.S. Orange Book patents that expire in 2030. These patents have been challenged in proceedings in the United States. We are appealing certain adverse U.S. District Court and Patent Trial and Appeal Board decisions to defend these patents in the United States. At least one competitor has obtained final FDA approval and has launched its generic version of COPAXONE 40 mg/mL. This launch, prior to final resolution of the pending patent litigation, should be considered an at-risk launch, which means that if the pending litigation is resolved in our favor, the company selling this generic medicine could face significant damages claims and other potential remedies. COPAXONE 40 mg/mL is also protected by one European patent expiring in 2030. This patent is being challenged in Italy and Norway and has been opposed at the European Patent Office. The U.K. High Court found this patent invalid and our application for permission to appeal this decision was rejected.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The market for MS treatments continues to develop, particularly with the recent approvals of generic versions of COPAXONE discussed above as well as additional generic versions expected to be approved in the future, such as Glatopa® 40 mg/mL. The increasing number of oral treatments for MS, such as Tecfidera®, Gilenya® and Aubagio®, continues to present significant and increasing competition. COPAXONE also continues to face competition from existing injectable products, as well as from monoclonal antibodies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | For information regarding our revenues from sales of COPAXONE, see Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsResults of Operations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
8 


 AUSTEDO 
 

 | AUSTEDO (deutetrabenazine) is a deuterated form of a small molecule inhibitor of vesicular monoamine 2 transporter, or VMAT2, that is designed to regulate the levels of a specific neurotransmitter, dopamine, in the brain. Deutetrabenazine was granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease in November 2014 and marketing exclusivity until April 3, 2024.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | AUSTEDO was approved by the FDA and launched in April 2017 in the United States for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease. In August 2017, the FDA approved AUSTEDO for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia (TD) in adults in the United States and we launched AUSTEDO for the treatment of TD in September 2017. TD is a debilitating, often irreversible movement disorder caused by certain medications used to treat mental health or gastrointestinal conditions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In September 2017, we entered into a partnership agreement with Nuvelution for development of AUSTEDO for the treatment of Tourette syndrome in pediatric patients in the United States. See Transactions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | AUSTEDO is protected in the United States by five Orange Book patents expiring between 2031 and 2033 and in Europe by two patents expiring in 2029.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 AZILECT®


 | AZILECT (rasagiline tablets) is indicated as initial monotherapy and as an adjunct to levodopa for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of Parkinsons disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. AZILECT is a second-generation, irreversible monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor. Generic versions of AZILECT were introduced in the United States and in Europe during 2017.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Central Nervous SystemPipeline 
 Our clinical pipeline of neurology and neuropsychiatry products includes: 
 

Products | Potential Indication(s) | Route ofAdministration | Development Phase (date entered phase 3)
AUSTEDO (deutetrabenazine) | Huntington disease | Oral | FDA approved, April 2017 
 | Tardive Dyskinesia | Oral | FDA approved, August 2017 
 | Tourette syndrome* | Oral | 3 (December 2017) 
Laquinimod | Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis | Oral | 3 (February 2013) 
 | Progressive forms of multiple sclerosis | Oral | 2 
 | Huntington disease | Oral | 2 
Pridopidine | Huntington disease | Oral | 2 


* | Developed in partnership with Nuvelution, which will fund and manage clinical development.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 AUSTEDO (deutetrabenazine) 
 

 | Teva and Nuvelution entered into a partnership agreement on September 19, 2017 to develop AUSTEDO for the treatment of tics associated with Tourette syndrome in pediatric patients in the United States. Nuvelution will fund and manage phase 3 clinical development, leading all operational aspects of the program. We will lead the regulatory process and be responsible for commercialization.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
9 


 Laquinimod 
 

 | Laquinimod is a once-daily, orally administered immunomodulatory compound being developed for treatment of relapsing-remitting and progressive forms of MS and for Huntigton disease. In 2012, we submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and a New Drug Submission to Health Canada following completion of two phase 3 studies in 2011. In 2014, the EMA confirmed that the risk-benefit profile of laquinimod is not favorable. In May 2017, we received results for the phase 3 CONCERTO trial indicating that the primary endpoint was not met for laquinimod, which compared 0.6 mg/daily capsules versus placebo to evaluate the time to confirmed disability progression after at least 3 months. In December 2017, results from the phase 2 proof of concept study (ARPEGGIO) of laquinimod as treatment for primary progressive MS were released and did not meet the primary or secondary endpoints.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2 clinical studies for treatment of Huntington disease are ongoing, with results expected in 2018.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Laquinimod is protected by patents expiring in 2019 worldwide, with potential for extensions in various markets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pridopidine 
 

 | Pridopidine is an oral small molecule dopamine stabilizer being developed for the symptomatic treatment of motor disorders (including Huntington disease). Results from the phase 2 Pride-HD clinical study demonstrated an unusually high placebo effect, which limited the ability to determine the effect of treatment on Huntington disease motor scores. However, evidence of symptomatic impact was seen in the early stage Huntington patient sub-population, with improvement in total motor score and dystonia observed at 26 and 52 weeks in this patient sub-set (stage 1 Huntington disease) at specific doses. We expect to be granted seven years of Orphan Drug exclusivity in the United States for this product.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Pridopidine is protected by patents worldwide that expire in 2020, with potential for extension in various markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our clinical pipeline of migraine and other pain products includes: 
 

Migraine and Other Pain Products | | Potential Indication(s) | | Route of Administration | | Development Phase (date entered phase 3)
Fremanezumab (anti CGRP) | | Chronic and episodic migraine | | Subcutaneous | | Submitted to FDA (October 2017) 
 | Cluster headache | | Subcutaneous | | 3 (November 2016)
 | Post traumatic headache | | Subcutaneous | | 2 
Fasinumab* | | Osteoarthritis pain | | Subcutaneous | | 3 (March 2016) 
 | | Chronic lower back pain | | Subcutaneous | | 2 
TV-45070 | | Neuropathic pain | | Topical | | 2 


* | Developed in collaboration with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Fremanezumab (anti CGRP) 
 

 | Fremanezumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which was submitted for FDA approval for the treatment of chronic and episodic migraine in October 2017. The Biologics License Application (BLA) was accepted for filing by the FDA in December 2017, and the FDA granted fast track designation for fremanezumab for the prevention of cluster headache. On February 2, 2018, the EMA accepted a Marketing Authorization Application for fremanezumab. Both product submissions were based on positive results from the phase 3 HALO program where both the chronic and episodic migraine studies met all primary and secondary endpoints in both monthly and quarterly dosing regimens while demonstrating a favorable risk/benefit profile.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
10 


 
 | In August 2017, we purchased an FDA priority review voucher from a third party for $150 million, which allowed us to accelerate the review period for fremanezumab in the United States.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | On May 12, 2017, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Otsuka, providing Otsuka with an exclusive license to conduct phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for fremanezumab in Japan and, once approved, to commercialize the product in Japan. See Transactions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Fremanezumab is also in clinical development to evaluate safety and efficacy in the treatment of chronic and episodic cluster headache as well as post traumatic headache. Phase 3 clinical studies for chronic and episodic migraine were initiated in early 2017. A phase 2 clinical study for the treatment of post traumatic headache was initiated in December 2017.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Fremanezumab is protected by patents expiring in 2026 in Europe and in 2027 in the United States, with possibility for extension in various markets. An additional patent application relating to use of fremanezumab in the treatment of migraine is currently pending worldwide, and if granted, would expire in 2035. Fremanezumab will also be protected by regulatory exclusivity of 12 years from marketing approval in the United States and 10 years from marketing approval in Europe.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In October 2017, we first filed suit for patent infringement against Eli Lilly (Lilly) in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Boston, Massachusetts. This suit was filed after Lillys announcement that it had filed a BLA for its migraine treatment galcanezumab. The lawsuit alleges that Lillys planned marketing and sales of galcanezumab would infringe five Teva patents covering CGRP inhibitors and methods of treatment, which will expire in 2026. In January 2017, Lilly filed a motion to dismiss this litigation. On February 6, 2018, two new U.S. patents were issued and we filed a new complaint against Lilly with respect to them. In the European Union, Alder Biopharmaceuticals and Lilly filed a European Patent Office opposition against our fremanezumab patents. Method of treatment claims were upheld in a first instance decision by the European Patent Office. This decision is currently on appeal with respect to Lilly and Teva; Alder withdrew from the appeal after entering into the license agreement described below. Lilly has also filed for revocation of the patent covering fremanezumab in the United Kingdom.

 OncologyPipeline 
 Our pipeline of oncology products includes CT-P10 (biosimilar candidate to Rituxan® US) and CT-P6 (biosimilar candidate to Herceptin® US). In October 2016, we entered into an exclusive partnership with Celltrion to commercialize two proposed monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in the United States and Canada. CT-P10 is a biosimilar candidate to Rituxan® (rituximab) and CT-P6 is a biosimilar candidate to Herceptin® (trastuzumab). BLAs for both products were accepted for review by the FDA in 2017 with regulatory action expected in the first half of 2018. 
In January 2018, Celltrion received an FDA warning letter for its facility in Incheon, South Korea. It is likely that the remediation by Celltrion of the issues addressed in the warning letter will result in a delayed approval of biosimilar products by the FDA. 
 Changes to Other Pipeline Projects During 2017 
 Development of the TV-46763 and TV-46139 pain products with potential abuse-deterrent properties were discontinued. 
 Commercialization opportunities for VANTRELA ERTM, which was approved by the FDA in January 2017, are no longer being pursued. VANTRELA is a formulation of hydrocodone (opioid analgesic) which utilizes OraGuard®, our proprietary abuse deterrence technology platform that has been evaluated for resistance to physical manipulations, chemical extractions and multi-step chemical extraction methods. 
 Other Activities 
 We have other sources of revenues, primarily sales of third-party products for which we act as distributor in certain countries. In the United States, our Anda business distributes generic, specialty and OTC pharmaceutical products from more than 300 third party manufacturers, as well as our own products, to independent retail pharmacies, pharmacy retail chains, hospitals and physician offices. Anda is able to compete in the secondary distribution market by maintaining high inventory levels for a broad offering of products, next day delivery throughout the United States, competitive pricing and high-level customer service. 
 We also sell medical devices, provide contract manufacturing services related to products divested in connection with the Actavis Generics acquisition and the sale of our womens health business, as well as other miscellaneous items. Our other activities are not included in our generics and specialty segments described above. 
 Research and Development 
 Our R&D activities span the breadth of our business, including generic medicines (finished goods and API), specialty pharmaceuticals, innovation of existing molecules and OTC medicines. 
 
17 


 Following implementation of our comprehensive restructuring plan announced in December 2017, the generic, specialty and OTC R&D organizations are expected to be combined into one global group with overall responsibility for all R&D activities  generic, specialty and biologics, enabling better focus and efficiency. We also announced the intention to close or sell a significant number of R&D facilities across all geographies, delivering efficiencies and substantial cost savings. We are conducting a thorough review of all R&D programs across the entire company, in generics and specialty, to prioritize core projects and terminate others, while maintaining a substantial pipeline. 
 For information about our R&D expenses during fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, see Item 7Managements Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsResearch and Development. 
 Generics 
 A strong focus for Teva is the development of new generic medicines. We develop generic products for the United States, Europe, Japan and other selected ROW countries. Our focus is on developing complex formulations with complex technologies, which have higher barriers to entry. Generic R&D activities, which are carried out in development centers located around the world, include product formulation, analytical method development, stability testing, management of bioequivalence, bio-analytical studies, other clinical studies and registration of generic drugs in all of the markets where we operate. We also operate several clinics where most of our bioequivalent studies are performed. We have more than 1,700 generic products in our pre-approved global pipeline. 
 In addition, our generic R&D supports our OTC business, including PGT, in developing OTC products, as well as in overseeing the work performed by contract developers. 
 Current R&D capabilities include solid oral dosage forms, inhalation, semi-solid and liquid formulations, and sterile formulations, such as tablets, capsules, liquids, ointments, creams and other dosage forms and delivery systems, such as matrix systems, special coating systems for sustained release products, orally disintegrating systems, sterile systems such as vials, syringes and blow-fill-seal systems, and more recently, capability build-up in long-acting release injectable, transdermal patches, oral thin film, drug device combinations and nasal delivery systems. In addition, we are in the process of developing multiple AB-rated respiratory programs and devices for our long active injectable pipeline. 
 Our API R&D division focuses on the development of processes for the manufacturing of APIs, including intermediates, chemicals and fermentation products, for both our generic and proprietary drugs. Our facilities include four large development centers: a center in Israel focusing on synthetic products and peptides, a center in Hungary specializing in fermentation and semi-synthetic products and centers in India and Croatia, both focusing on synthetic products. Three additional smaller sites are located in Italy, Mexico and the Czech Republic for development of high-potency APIs. Our substantial investment in API R&D generates a steady flow of API products, enabling the timely introduction of generic products to market. The API R&D division also seeks methods to continuously reduce API production costs, enabling us to improve our cost structure. 
 Specialty 
 Our specialty R&D product pipeline is focused on novel small molecule and biologic products, biosimilar products, innovation of existing molecules as well as discovery of new small molecule and biologic candidates. Specialty development activities include preclinical assessment (including toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and pharmacology studies), clinical development (including pharmacology and the design, execution and analysis of global safety and efficacy trials), as well as regulatory strategy to deliver registration of our pipeline products. 
 Our specialty R&D develops novel specialty products in our core therapeutic and disease focus areas. We have CNS projects in areas such as migraine, pain, movement disorders/neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatry. 
 
18 


  Our respiratory projects are focused on asthma and COPD and include both novel compounds and delivery systems designed to address unmet patient needs. We also pursue select pipeline projects (e.g., biosimilars) in other therapeutic and disease areas that leverage our global R&D and commercial areas of expertise. 
 We pursue in-licensing, acquisition and partnership opportunities to supplement and expand our specialty pipeline (e.g., the transactions with Celltrion, Eagle and Regeneron) to create and maintain a robust global pipeline. In parallel, we evaluate and expand the development scope of our existing R&D pipeline products as well as our existing products for submission in additional markets. 
 Operations 
 We operate our business globally and believe that our global infrastructure provides us with the following capabilities and advantages:

 Pharmaceutical Production 
 We operate 62 finished dosage and packaging pharmaceutical plants in 33 countries. These plants manufacture solid dosage forms, sterile injectables, liquids, semi-solids, inhalers, transdermal patches and medical devices. In 2017, we produced approximately 88 billion tablets and capsules and approximately 720 million sterile units. The FDA has approved 33 of our finished dosage manufacturing facilities and we have 30 finished dosage manufacturing facilities approved by EMA authorities. 
 Our primary manufacturing technologies, solid dosage forms, injectables and blow-fill-seal, are available in North America, Europe, Latin America and Israel. The manufacturing sites located in Israel, Germany, Hungary, Croatia, Bulgaria, India, Spain and the Czech Republic make up the majority of our production capacity. 
 We use several external contract manufacturers to achieve operational and cost benefits. We continue to strengthen our third party operations unit to strategically work with our supplier base in order to meet cost, supply security and quality targets on a sustainable base in alignment with our global procurement organization. 
 Our policy is to maintain multiple supply sources for our strategic products and APIs to appropriately mitigate risk in our supply chain to the extent possible. However, our ability to do so may be limited by regulatory and other requirements. 
 In connection with implementation of our comprehensive restructuring plan announced in December 2017, we intend to close or divest a significant number of manufacturing plants in the United States, Europe, Israel and other ROW markets.

 Raw Materials for Pharmaceutical Production 
 In general, we purchase our raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products in the open market. For some products, we purchase our raw materials and supplies from one source (the only source available to us) or a single source (the only approved source among many available to us), thereby requiring us to obtain such raw materials and supplies from that particular source. We attempt, if possible, to mitigate our raw material supply risks through inventory management and alternative sourcing strategies. 
 We source a large portion of our APIs from our own manufacturing facilities. Additional APIs are purchased from suppliers located in Europe, Asia and the United States. We have implemented a supplier audit program to ensure that our suppliers meet our high standards and take a global approach to managing our commercial relations with these suppliers. 
 We currently have 18 API production facilities, producing approximately 300 APIs in various therapeutic areas. Our API intellectual property portfolio includes approximately 600 granted patents and pending applications worldwide. 
 We have expertise in a variety of production technologies, including chemical synthesis, semi-synthetic fermentation, enzymatic synthesis, high-potency manufacturing, plant extract technology, peptides synthesis, vitamin D derivatives synthesis and prostaglandins synthesis. Our advanced technology and expertise in the field of solid state particle technology enable us to meet specifications for particle size distribution, bulk density, specific surface area and polymorphism, as well as other characteristics. 
 Our API facilities are required to comply with applicable current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) requirements under U.S., European, Japanese and other applicable quality standards. Our API plants are regularly inspected by the FDA, European agencies or other authorities as applicable. 
 Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights 
 We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary know-how and regulatory exclusivities, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We own or license a number of patents covering our products in the United States and other countries. We have also developed many brand names and own many trademarks covering our products. We consider the overall protection of our intellectual property rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement. We license or assign certain intellectual property rights to third parties in connection with certain business transactions. 
Environment, Health and Safety 
 We are committed to business practices that promote socially and environmentally responsible economic growth. During 2017, we continued to make significant progress on our multi-year plan to move closer to our long-term environment, health and safety (EHS) vision of Target Zero: zero incidents, zero injuries and zero releases. Among other things, in 2017 we: 

 | continued the implementation of our global EHS management system, which promotes proactive compliance with applicable environment, health and safety requirements, establishes minimum expectations throughout our global operations and helps drive continuous improvement in our EHS performance;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | provided EHS regulatory surveillance tools for all countries where we have significant operations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | proactively evaluated EHS compliance through self-evaluation and an internal audit program, addressing non-conformities through appropriate corrective and preventative action whose progress is tracked; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
20 


 
 | established targets to reduce the environmental impact of our operations, through energy and water conservation, recycling and reuse of waste products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quality 
 We are committed not only to complying with quality requirements but to developing and leveraging quality as a competitive advantage. In 2017, we successfully completed numerous inspections by various regulatory agencies of our finished dosage pharmaceutical plants and our pharmacovigilance function, continued discussions with authorities about drug shortages and participated in several industry-wide task forces. We continue to focus on maintaining a solid and sustainable quality compliance foundation, as well as making quality a priority beyond compliance. We seek to ensure that quality remains part of our corporate culture and is reflected in all of our operations, resulting in reliable and high quality products. 
 Following an FDA audit of our API production facility in China in September 2016, we received a warning letter from the FDA in April 2017. We have undertaken corrective actions to address both the specific concerns raised by investigators as well as the underlying causes of those concerns and resumed shipments from that facility in May 2017. We have requested that the FDA conduct a follow-up inspection to confirm compliance and issue a close-out letter. 
 Geographic Areas 
 Our business is conducted in many countries all over the world and a significant portion of our revenues is generated from operations outside the United States. The products we make and sell around the world include many of those described above under Our SegmentsGeneric Medicines and Our SegmentsSpecialty Medicines. 
 Investments and activities in some countries outside the Unites States are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties. Changes in the relative values of currencies may materially affect our results of operations. For a discussion of these risks, see Item 1ARisk Factors. 
 For information regarding revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area, see Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsResults of Operations, and note 20 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Competition 
 Generic Medicines Competition 
 Sales of generic medicines have benefitted from increasing awareness and acceptance on the part of healthcare insurers and institutions, consumers, physicians and pharmacists globally. Factors contributing to this increased awareness are the passage of legislation permitting or encouraging generic substitution and the publication by regulatory authorities of lists of equivalent pharmaceuticals, which provide physicians and pharmacists with generic alternatives. In addition, various government agencies and many private managed care or insurance programs encourage the substitution of brand-name pharmaceuticals with generic products as a cost-savings measure in the purchase of, or reimbursement for, prescription pharmaceuticals. 
 In the United States, we are subject to competition in the generic drug market from domestic and international generic drug manufacturers, brand-name pharmaceutical companies through lifecycle management initiatives, authorized generics, existing brand equivalents and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs. An increase in FDA approvals for generic products is increasing the competition on our base generic products. Price competition from additional generic versions of the same product typically results in margin pressures. 
 
21 


 The European market continues to be ever more competitive, especially in terms of pricing, higher quality standards, customer service and portfolio relevance. We are one of only a few companies with a pan-European footprint, while most of our European competitors focus on a limited number of selected markets or business lines. Our leadership position in Europe allows us to be a reliable partner to fulfill the needs of patients, physicians, pharmacies, customers and payers. 
 In our ROW markets, our global scale and broad portfolio give us a significant competitive advantage over local competitors, allowing us to optimize our offerings through a combination of high quality medicines and unique go-to-market approaches. 
 Furthermore, in significant markets such as France, Japan and Russia, governments have issued or are in process of issuing regulations designed to increase generic penetration. These conditions result in intense competition in the generic market, with generic companies competing for advantage based on pricing, time to market, reputation, and customer service. 
 Specialty Medicines Competition 
 Our specialty medicines business faces intense competition from both specialty and generic pharmaceutical companies. The specialty business may continue to be affected by price reforms and changes in the political landscape, following recent public debate in the United States. We believe that our primary competitive advantages include our commercial marketing teams, global R&D capabilities, the body of scientific evidence substantiating the safety and efficacy of our various medicines, our patient-centric solutions, physician and patient experience with our medicines and our medical capabilities, which are tailored to our product offerings and to our market and stakeholders needs. 
Regulation 
 United States 
 Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration 
 All pharmaceutical manufacturers selling products in the United States are subject to extensive regulation by the United States federal government, principally by the FDA and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and, to a lesser extent, by state and local governments. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern or influence the development, manufacture, testing, safety, efficacy, labeling, approval, storage, distribution, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, sale, import and export of our products. Our facilities are periodically inspected by the FDA, which has extensive enforcement powers over the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers. Noncompliance with applicable requirements may result in fines, criminal penalties, civil injunction against shipment of products, recall and seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, sale or import of products, refusal of the government to enter into supply contracts or to approve NDAs, ANDAs, or BLAs and criminal prosecution by the Department of Justice. The FDA also has the authority to deny or revoke approvals of marketing applications and the power to halt the operations of non-complying manufacturers. Any failure to comply with applicable FDA policies and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 FDA approval is required before any new drug (including generic versions of previously approved drugs) may be marketed, including new strengths, dosage forms and formulations of previously approved drugs. Applications for FDA approval must contain information relating to bioequivalence (for generics), safety, toxicity and efficacy (for new drugs), product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing processes, packaging, labeling and quality control. FDA procedures generally require that commercial manufacturing equipment be used to produce test batches for FDA approval. The FDA also requires validation of manufacturing processes so that a company may market new products. The FDA conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to implement these requirements. 
 
22 


 The federal CSA and its implementing regulations establish a closed system of controlled substance distribution for legitimate handlers. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements upon legitimate handlers under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA categorizes controlled substances into one of five schedulesSchedule I, II, III, IV, or Vwith varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. Facilities that manufacture, distribute, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA inspects manufacturing facilities to review security, record keeping and reporting and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action, such as civil penalties, refusal to renew necessary registrations, or the initiation of proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution. 
 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (the Hatch-Waxman Act) established the procedures for obtaining FDA approval for generic forms of brand-name drugs. This act also provides market exclusivity provisions that can delay the approval of certain NDAs and ANDAs. One such provision allows a five-year period of data exclusivity for NDAs containing new chemical entities and a three-year period of market exclusivity for NDAs (including different dosage forms) containing new clinical trial(s) essential to the approval of the application. The Orphan Drug Act grants seven years of exclusive marketing rights to a specific drug for a specific orphan indication. The term orphan drug refers, generally, to a drug that treats a rare disease affecting fewer than 200,000 Americans. Market exclusivity provisions are distinct from patent protections and apply equally to patented and non-patented drug products. Another provision of the Hatch-Waxman Act extends certain patents for up to five years as compensation for the reduction of effective life of the patent which resulted from time spent in clinical trials and time spent by the FDA reviewing a drug application. 
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, any company submitting an ANDA or an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (i.e., an NDA that, similar to an ANDA, relies, in whole or in part, on FDAs prior approval of another companys drug product; also known as a 505(b)(2) application) must make certain certifications with respect to the patent status of the drug for which it is seeking approval. In the event that such applicant plans to challenge the validity or enforceability of an existing listed patent or asserts that the proposed product does not infringe an existing listed patent, it files a Paragraph IV certification. In the case of ANDAs, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides for a potential 180-day period of generic exclusivity for the first company to submit an ANDA with a Paragraph IV certification. This filing triggers a regulatory process in which the FDA is required to delay the final approval of subsequently filed ANDAs containing Paragraph IV certifications until 180 days after the first commercial marketing. For both ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications, when litigation is brought by the patent holder, in response to this Paragraph IV certification, the FDA generally may not approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months or a court decision finding the patent invalid, not infringed or unenforceable. Submission of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) application with a Paragraph IV certification can result in protracted and expensive patent litigation. 
 Products manufactured outside the United States and marketed in the United States are subject to all of the above regulations, as well as to FDA and United States customs regulations at the port of entry. Products marketed outside the United States that are manufactured in the United States are additionally subject to various export statutes and regulations, as well as regulation by the country in which the products are to be sold. 
 Our products also include biopharmaceutical products that are comparable to brand-name biologics, but that are not approved as biosimilar versions of such brand-name products. Of this portfolio, TEV-TROPIN® and GRANIX are sold in the United States, while others are distributed outside of the United States. While regulations are still being developed by the FDA relating to the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, which created a statutory pathway for the approval of biosimilar versions of brand-name biological products and a process to resolve patent disputes, the FDA has issued guidance to provide a roadmap for development of biosimilar products. 
 
23 


 In August 2017, the FDA user fee reauthorization legislation, known as the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA) was enacted in the United States. The agreements for pharmaceuticals, biosimilars, and medical devices were negotiated with industry representatives over the course of 2016 to establish the amounts regulated companies would pay the FDA to support the product review process at the agency. Various fees must be paid by these manufacturers at different times, such as annually and with the submission of different types of applications. In return for this additional funding, the FDA has entered into agreements with each of the affected industries (known as the user fee agreements) that commit the agency to interacting with manufacturers and reviewing applications such as NDAs, ANDAs, and BLAs in certain ways, and taking action on those applications at certain times. The agency is obligated to set specific timelines to communicate with companies and meet with company product sponsors during the review process and take action on their applications. On the generics side, FDARA established a new 180-day exclusivity for generic drugs that are no longer protected by exclusivity or patents, as well as new programs for enhanced and priority review of certain generic drug applications. On the branded side, this was the sixth agreement between the industry and the FDA. The user fee agreement for biosimilars was reauthorized for the second time as well. 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Certain Government Programs 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) from 2010 represented the most significant health care reform in the United States in over thirty years. It was passed to require individuals to have health insurance and to control the rate of growth in healthcare spending through, among other things, stronger prevention and wellness measures, increased access to primary care, changes in healthcare delivery systems and the creation of health insurance exchanges. Enrollment in the health insurance exchanges began in October 2013. However, the individual mandate was just repealed by Congress in the tax reform bill that was signed into law in December 2017. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the repeal will result in over 13 million Americans losing their health insurance coverage over the next ten years and is likely to lead to increases in insurance premiums. 
 The ACA requires the pharmaceutical industry to share in the costs of reform, by, among other things, increasing Medicaid rebates and expanding Medicaid rebates to cover Medicaid managed care programs. The ACA also included funding of pharmaceutical costs for Medicare patients in excess of the prescription drug coverage limit and below the catastrophic coverage threshold. Under the ACA, pharmaceutical companies are obligated to fund 50% of the patient obligation for branded prescription pharmaceuticals in this gap, or donut hole. Additionally, an excise tax was levied against certain branded pharmaceutical products. The tax is specified by statute to be approximately $3.5 billion in 2017, $4.2 billion in 2018, and $2.8 billion each year thereafter. The tax is to be apportioned to qualifying pharmaceutical companies based on an allocation of their governmental programs as a portion of total pharmaceutical government programs. The Administration is currently looking at Medicare parts B and D in terms of policy changes in the next session of Congress. 
 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) administer the Medicaid drug rebate program, in which pharmaceutical manufacturers pay quarterly rebates to each state Medicaid agency. Generally, for generic drugs marketed under ANDAs, manufacturers (including Teva) are required to rebate 13% of the average manufacturer price, and for products marketed under NDAs or BLAs, manufacturers are required to rebate the greater of 23.1% of the average manufacturer price or the difference between such price and the best price during a specified period. An additional rebate for products marketed under NDAs or BLAs is payable if the average manufacturer price increases at a rate higher than inflation, and other methodologies apply to new formulations of existing drugs. This provision was extended at the end of 2015 to cover generic drugs marketed under ANDAs as well. The Association for Accessible Medicines, the generic drug manufacturers trade association, is working to undo this policy as penalty on the industry and will continue to lobby for its abolishment. 
 In addition, the ACA revised certain definitions used for purposes of calculating the rebates, including the definition of average manufacturer price. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 contains language intended to exempt certain abuse-deterrent formulations of a drug from the definition of line extension for purposes of the program. 
 
24 


 Various state Medicaid programs have implemented voluntary supplemental drug rebate programs that may provide states with additional manufacturer rebates in exchange for preferred status on a states formulary or for patient populations that are not included in the traditional Medicaid drug benefit coverage. 
 Europe 
 General 
 In Europe, marketing authorizations for pharmaceutical products may be obtained either through a centralized procedure involving the EMA, a mutual recognition procedure which requires submission of applications in other member states following approval by a so-called reference member state, a decentralized procedure that entails simultaneous submission of applications to chosen member states or occasionally through a local national procedure. 
 During 2017, we continued to register products in the European Union, primarily using the decentralized procedure (simultaneous submission of applications to chosen member states). We continue to use, on occasion, the mutual recognition and centralized procedures. 
 The European pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated and much of the legislative and regulatory framework is driven by the European Parliament and the European Commission. This has many benefits, including the potential to harmonize standards across the complex European market, but it also has the potential to create complexities affecting the whole of the European market. 
 In October 2015, the European Commission adopted regulations providing detailed rules for the safety features appearing on the packaging of medicinal products for human use. This legislation, part of the Falsified Medicines Directive, is intended to prevent counterfeit medicines entering into the supply chain and will allow wholesale distributors and others who supply medicines to the public to verify the authenticity of the medicine at the level of the individual pack. The safety features comprise a unique identifier and a tamper-evident seal on the outer packaging, which are to be applied to certain categories of medicines. We are working to ensure we have the necessary infrastructure in place to ensure there is no disruption to our supply chain when the regulations take effect in 2019. 
 In connection with the Actavis Generics acquisition, we made a number of commitments to the European Commission to divest certain Actavis Generics assets and operations. Transfer of the marketing authorizations to the respective buyers is an important step in meeting these commitments, but in many cases regulatory submissions will also be required to transfer production of the finished product to the buyer. We are working with the regulators to separate certain marketing authorizations to be transferred to the buyers from other linked authorizations, which we are retaining, a process that is expected to take 3-5 years to complete. 
 In November 2017, the last part of the 2012 European Union regulation regarding pharmacovigilance was implemented, requiring centralized reporting in the European Union instead of individual country reporting. Under this regulation, all adverse events need to be reported regardless of severity. 
 European Union 
 The medicines regulatory framework of the European Union requires that medicinal products, including generic versions of previously approved products and new strengths, dosage forms and formulations of previously approved products, receive a marketing authorization before they can be placed on the market in the European Union. Authorizations are granted after a favorable assessment of quality, safety and efficacy by the respective health authorities. In order to obtain authorization, application must be made to the EMA or to the competent authority of the member state concerned. Besides various formal requirements, the application must contain the results of pharmaceutical (physico-chemical, biological or microbiological) tests, pre-clinical 
 
25 


  (toxicological and pharmacological) tests and clinical trials. All of these tests must have been conducted in accordance with relevant European regulations and must allow the reviewer to evaluate the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product. 
 In order to control expenditures on pharmaceuticals, most member states of the European Union regulate the pricing of such products and in some cases limit the range of different forms of a drug available for prescription by national health services. These controls can result in considerable price differences among member states. 
 In addition to patent protection, exclusivity provisions in the European Union may prevent companies from applying for marketing approval for a generic product for eight (or ten years for orphan medicinal products) from the date of the first market authorization of the original product in the European Union. Further, the generic product will be barred from market entry (marketing exclusivity) for a further two years, with the possibility of extending the market exclusivity by one additional year under certain circumstances. 
 The term of certain pharmaceutical patents may be extended in the European Union by up to five years upon grant of Supplementary Patent Certificates (SPC). The purpose of this extension is to increase effective patent life (i.e., the period between grant of a marketing authorization and patent expiry) to 15 years. 
 Subject to the respective pediatric regulation, the holder of an SPC may obtain a further patent term extension of up to six months under certain conditions. This six-month period cannot be claimed if the license holder claims a one-year extension of the period of marketing exclusivity based on the grounds that a new pediatric indication brings a significant clinical benefit in comparison with other existing therapies. 
 Orphan designated products, which receive, under certain conditions, a blanket period of ten years of market exclusivity, may receive an additional two years of exclusivity instead of an extension of the SPC if the requirements of the pediatric regulation are met. 
 The legislation also allows for R&D work during the patent term for the purpose of developing and submitting registration dossiers. 
 In 2016, the United Kingdom conducted a referendum and voted to leave the European Union, also known as Brexit. On March 29, 2017, the British government invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union and, as a result, the United Kingdom is scheduled to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019. The United Kingdom and European Union are currently in the process of defining their future relationship, but as pharmaceutical legislation in the United Kingdom is largely derived from European Union law and relies on mutual recognition of decision making, implementation of a number of practical steps is required before the United Kingdom exits the European Union. We are working on processes to ensure a smooth transition irrespective of the future decisions between the parties. 
 Rest of World 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we, and our partners, are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales, marketing and distribution of our products, similar or more stringent than the laws of the United States. 
 Whether or not we, or our partners, obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In addition, we, and our partners, may be subject to foreign laws and regulations and other compliance requirements, including, without limitation, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws and other fraud and abuse laws, as well as laws and regulations requiring transparency of pricing and marketing information and governing the privacy and security of health information. 
 
26 


 If we, or our partners, fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Miscellaneous Regulatory Matters 
 We are subject to various national, regional and local laws of general applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions. We are also subject to country specific data protection laws and regulations applicable to the storage and processing of personal data throughout the world. In addition, we are subject to various national, regional and local environmental protection laws and regulations, including those governing the emission of material into the environment. We are also subject to various national, regional and local laws regulating how we interact with healthcare professionals and representatives of government that impact our promotional activities. 
 Data exclusivity provisions exist in many countries worldwide and may be introduced in additional countries in the future, although their application is not uniform. In general, these exclusivity provisions prevent the approval and/or submission of generic drug applications to the health authorities for a fixed period of time following the first approval of the brand-name product in that country. As these exclusivity provisions operate independently of patent exclusivity, they may prevent the submission of generic drug applications for some products even after the patent protection has expired. 
 In November 2013, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act was enacted in the United States, mandating an industry-wide, national serialization system for pharmaceutical packaging with a ten-year phase-in process. By November 27, 2018, all manufacturers and re-packagers must mark each prescription drug package with a unique serialized code. We are working to meet these requirements on a timely basis. Other countries are following suit with variations of two main requirements: (i) to be able to associate the unit data with the uniquely-identified shipping package, or (ii) to report the data for tracking and tracing of products, reimbursements, and other purposes. The European Union, Russia, China, Korea, Turkey, Argentina, Brazil, India (for exported products) and certain other countries already have laws mandating serialization and we are working to comply with these requirements. Other countries, including India (domestic market), Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and other Latin American countries are currently considering mandating similar requirements. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, Tevas work force consisted of approximately 51,800 full-time-equivalent employees. In certain countries, we are party to collective bargaining agreements with certain groups of employees. 
 The following table presents our work force by geographic area: 
 

 | December 31, | 
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
United States | | 12,416 | | 10,168 | | 6,342 
Europe | | 22,350 | | 24,170 | | 18,316
Rest of the World (excluding Israel) | | 10,780 | | 15,759 | | 11,256
Israel | | 6,245 | | 6,863 | | 6,974 
Total | | 51,792 | | 56,960 | | 42,888

 As part of our restructuring announcement in December 2017, we expect to reduce our global work force by 14,000 positions, which is over 25% of Tevas total work force as of December 31, 2017, by the end of 2019 (excluding the impact of any future divestments). The majority of the reductions are expected to occur in 2018. Restructuring efforts will be done in accordance with applicable local requirements. Consultations with the relevant employee representatives began in January 2018.
