Item 1. Business
General
We are a leading operator of government health and human services programs and provider of technology solutions to governments. We are a responsible and reliable contracting partner to governments under our mission of Moving People Forward. Governments rely on our financial stability and proven expertise in helping people connect and use critical government programs. We use our experience, business process management expertise, innovation, and technology solutions to help government agencies run effective, efficient, and accountable programs.
Our primary portfolio of work is business process services ("BPS") in the health and human services markets. Our growth over the last decade was driven by new work, an evolving digital transformation effort to meet the modernization needs of our clients, and a growing footprint in clinical services including assessments, appeals, and independent medical reviews in multiple geographies. Over the past decade, legislative and environmental circumstances have driven our growth. The 2010 Affordable Care Act ("ACA") in the United States ("U.S.") created new and enhanced BPS opportunities for both states and the federal government clients. Since the enactment of the law, we have been a go-to service provider for services such as government health insurance program administration, eligibility and enrollment services, and consumer outreach and education. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic created new opportunities for our U.S. Services and Federal segments. In fiscal year 2021, we were successful in winning new contracts tied to public health initiatives such as vaccine information hotlines and unemployment insurance to help governments respond to COVID-19 crises. While most new COVID-19 related work was short-term, by creating and building positive client relationships, we have been successful in securing several longer-term projects. 
Our growth has been supplemented by strategic acquisitions. We have an active program to identify potential strategic acquisitions to enable long-term, sustainable, organic growth by continuing to build scale, enhance our clinical and digital capabilities, and extend into new market areas. As we evaluate potential acquisitions, we are mindful of our goal to create long-term shareholder value. Our recent acquisitions further our progress on our long-term strategy, discussed in greater detail below. An overview of recent acquisitions include:
•In October 2021, we acquired the U.S. Department of Education-owned loan servicing contract from Navient. Rebranded as "Aidvantage," the acquisition expanded our track record for supporting Federal Student Aid ("FSA") and demonstrates our strategic commitment to providing strong customer service supported by leading digital capabilities. 
•In September 2021, we acquired Connect Assist, a market-leading provider of contact center and digital services in the United Kingdom. The Connect Assist partnership is expected to strengthen our already formidable customer service and digital capabilities as we continue our expansion into new markets. 
•In May 2021, we acquired VES Group, Inc. ("VES"), a leading provider of Medical Disability Examinations ("MDEs") for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA"). This acquisition accelerates our clinical evolution to meet long-term demand for BPS with a clinical dimension.
•In March 2021, we acquired the Federal business of Attain, LLC ("Attain"). The additional capabilities from Attain meaningfully expand our technology consulting and growing systems integration skills, increasing our ability to address the most pressing information technology ("IT") needs of our Federal clients while providing internal opportunities to improve the quality and efficiency of our BPS operations. Attain is delivering on complex program challenges for critical clients, while gaining the ability to bid on larger opportunities through newly available contract vehicles.
As the pandemic has underscored, governments around the world need better solutions to deliver on policy priorities that can change rapidly. Social welfare programs that reflect long-term societal commitments and priorities increasingly face rising demand, shifting demographics, and unsustainable program costs. Maximus is well-positioned to address these challenges and be a transformative partner through our scalable, cost-effective, and operationally efficient services for a wide range of government programs.
We have refreshed our strategy and updated the three pillars on which we will focus growth efforts for the next three to five years:
•Customer Services, Digitally Enabled. We apply proven technologies, data, and best practices to make government programs more customer-focused, effective, and deserving of the public's trust. We make it easier for people to connect to government services based on their individual preferences and abilities. We are elevating the customer experience to achieve higher levels of satisfaction, performance, and outcomes through intelligent automation and cognitive computing. 
•Future of Health. We are expanding our clinical-related services and are experienced at delivering clinical BPS at scale. We have established an extensive set of services that frequently requires a network of healthcare professionals who can complete clinical assessments, provide occupational health and independent medical review services, and adjudicate complicated benefits appeals. With the formation of Maximus Public Health ("MPH"), we are able to serve as a resource to governments as they respond to public health threats. 
•Advanced Technologies for Modernization. We are furthering our credibility as a technology leader, enabling the transformation of government programs to be resilient, dynamic, integrated and equitable. Leveraging our deep relationships and program knowledge, we are delivering technology-driven business transformation of government missions with a strategic near-term focus on hybrid cloud solutions, information intelligence, and hyper-automation. We believe that these technologies can help our government clients run their programs in a more streamlined manner and make it easier for individuals to interact with these programs.
More information on how each of our business segments align with the execution of our strategy is provided below. Across all segments, there is a common focus on optimizing processes and simplifying our structure. We also continue to focus on our people - the foundation of our strategy. Our commitment to making Maximus an employer of choice is not a new goal, and we continue to prioritize attracting, retaining, developing, and empowering employees as a central part of our plan for achieving future growth. More information on our Human Resource priorities is included below.
Our Business Segments
We operate our business through three segments: U.S. Federal Services, U.S. Services, and Outside the U.S. We operate in the U.S., Australia, United Kingdom ("U.K."), Canada, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Italy, South Korea, Sweden, and United Arab Emirates ("UAE").
For the year ended September 30, 2022, approximately 47% of our revenue was derived from U.S. Federal Government agencies, 35% from U.S. state government agencies, 16% from foreign government agencies, and the balance from other sources, including local municipalities and commercial customers.
For more information on our segment presentation and geographic distribution of our business, including comparative revenue, gross profit, operating income, identifiable assets, and related financial information for the 2022, 2021, and 2020 fiscal years, see "Note 3. Business Segments" within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
U.S. Federal Services Segment
Our U.S. Federal Services Segment generated 49% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2022.
Our U.S. Federal Services Segment delivers end-to-end solutions that help various U.S. federal government agencies better deliver on their mission, including program operations and management, clinical services, and technology solutions. The segment also contains certain state-based assessments and appeals work that is part of the segment's heritage within the Medicare Appeals portfolio. 
Program Operations. Program Operations include business process services, eligibility and enrollment, outreach, and other services for federal health and human services programs. In fiscal year 2022, our contract with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid to support the Contact Center Operations ("CCO") was renewed. This contract supports the federal marketplace under the ACA and serves as the primary support engagement center for Medicare, also known as 1-800-MEDICARE. The contract serves the U.S. population through eleven customer contact centers handling general inquiries for the marketplace and general and claims-based Medicare inquiries. 
In October 2021, we acquired the Navient student loan contract, rebranded as Aidvantage. We are an independent and conflict-free provider, as we will not provide loan origination, consolidation, or collection services. We view student loan servicing as an opportunity to apply our insights, expertise, and quality-driven approach through support for Federal Student Aid ("FSA"), and student borrowers. Aidvantage is an extension of long-standing work supporting student loan management and is in line with our core business. Our focus is solely on supporting the student borrowers on behalf of FSA.
The manner in which we provide these services varies from contract to contract but may include a mix of contact centers, mail-room operations, and mobile and website media.
Clinical Services. In line with our strategic focus for the future, the segment continues to expand its clinical solutions. This is evident in the acquisition of VES, which manages the clinical evaluation process for U.S. veterans and service members on behalf of the VA and the clinical offerings in public health including work supporting the federal government's COVID-19 response efforts. 
A leading provider of MDEs, VES brings a deep and longstanding relationship with the VA, as well as a team of experienced clinicians focused on serving veterans. While our independent clinical assessments business has been growing at the state level (through our previous acquisition of Ascend and subsequent organic growth), VES' expertise provides a platform of scale for the first time at the Federal level. We believe that-near term growth should also be realized as a result of the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 ("PACT") Act, passed in August 2022. The PACT Act expands certain conditions under which veterans would presumptively qualify for benefits and would result in increases in MDE volumes. We expect to realize and deliver on higher volumes related to the PACT Act beginning in fiscal year 2023. 
The independent health and disability assessments and appeals portion of our business will comprise a larger share of our overall portfolio, lending further credibility to our organic growth efforts with other Federal departments and in non-Federal markets. 
This segment performed some services to assist the U.S. federal government response to the pandemic, including contact tracing and vaccine distribution support. 
Technology Solutions. Also aligned with our strategic focus, and benefiting from the Attain platform, the Technology and Consulting Services ("TCS") division executes on its digital strategy to deliver technology solutions that advance agency missions, including the challenge to modernize, provide better customer experience, and drive process efficiencies. The TCS division is comprised of experts who helped successfully pioneer the first large-scale implementation of a cloud-computing solution for a federal department. TCS's core capabilities build further upon our cloud-based solutions and include:
•Application development & modernization: Modernize, develop, and deliver solutions utilizing automation, agile, and DevSecOps practices.
•Enterprise Business Solutions: Integrate and manage disparate business processes and systems.
•Advanced Analytics & Emerging Technologies: Provide technology services to leverage and integrate the latest technologies for AI and machine learning, automation, and high-performance computing.
•Cybersecurity: Deliver full spectrum cybersecurity services, including cyber engineering and operations, digital forensics, and incident response.
•Infrastructure and Engineering: Deploy solutions that leverage cloud-hosted and on-premise designs to optimize costs.
TCS has also built digital qualifications in the market. The division utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to build bespoke data models, providing predictive analytics to maximize process efficiency, as well as identify systemic process issues that can be isolated and prioritized for troubleshooting. End-to-end automation of software development and business processes achieves speed, efficiency, and error reduction as well as advanced tool capabilities resulting in greater operational efficiency, enhanced customer experiences, and increased ROI. Finally, high performance computing clusters support mission requirements for data mining, scientific modeling, advanced analytics, research, and machine learning.
The segment contains performance-based contracts where revenue is earned based upon participant numbers or other transaction-based measures, such as the number and type of assessments or appeals processed. Many contracts in this segment earn their revenue on a cost-plus or time-and-materials basis, which typically carry lower levels of risk and lower levels of profit margin as compared to performance-based contracts. The segment may experience fluctuations as a result of volume variations or program maturity, with contracts recording lower revenue and profitability during program startup.
Our primary competitors in the U.S. Federal Services Segment are Serco, General Dynamics Information Technology, Amentum, Cognosante, and Conduent. Within the technology sector, our primary competitors are IBM, Oracle, Leidos, Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen Hamilton, and other federal contractors.
U.S. Services Segment
Our U.S. Services Segment generated 35% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2022.
Our U.S. Services Segment provides a variety of BPS such as program administration, appeals and assessments, and related consulting work for U.S. state and local government programs. These services support a variety of programs, including ACA, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program ("CHIP"), Temporary Assistance to Needy Families ("TANF"), and child support programs. As part of the governments' COVID-19 response efforts, the segment supported contact tracing, disease investigation, and vaccine distribution support services during the peak of the pandemic. The segment also successfully expanded into the unemployment insurance market where longer term opportunities have materialized. As part of the broader strategy to evolve clinically and address societal macro trends such as aging populations and rising costs, the segment continues to expand its offerings in public health with new work in in-person assessments. 
Program Operations. Program operations includes our comprehensive program administration services for government health benefit programs. The services we provide vary from program to program but may include:
•Program eligibility support and enrollment services to help beneficiaries make the best choice for their health insurance coverage to improve their access to healthcare;
•Centralized multilingual customer contact centers and multichannel, digital self-service options for simplified enrollment to better serve citizens' needs;
•Application assistance and independent health plan choice counseling to beneficiaries; and
•Beneficiary outreach, education, eligibility assistance, enrollment, and redeterminations services. In programs such as Medicaid, Maximus does not make the final determination of eligibility.
We also provide some specialized services, including substance abuse, diversion program support and administration of subsidized telephony services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided support in contact tracing.
As a leading player in many of the health program administration markets that we serve, we believe we are one of the largest providers of Medicaid enrollment services in the U.S and that we are a leading provider of CHIP services and state-based health insurance exchange operations.
Clinical Services. This service type includes our independent appeals and person-centered assessments services, primarily under Medicaid Long-Term Care. The growth of our clinical services demonstrates successful execution of our continued strategy and focus on clinical services. These services help governments engage with program recipients while at the same time help them improve the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, quality, and accountability of their health and disability benefits programs. These include person-centered independent disability, long-term sick, and other health assessments, including those related to long-term services and supports such as Preadmission Screening and Resident Reviews ("PASRR") and Independent Developmental Disability ("IDD") assessments. We are a leading provider of such services in the U.S. In addition, we provide connected wellness services which promote healthy living habits amongst participants.
Employment Services. Employment services cover a number of attributes, including eligibility support, case management, job-readiness preparation, job search and employer outreach, job retention and career advancement, and selected educational and training services, including vocational training. Maximus supports 14 states and their efforts with unemployment insurance. These contracts were initially procured in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but have transitioned into long-term programs. Children services include full and specialized child support case management services, including collection of child-support funds, through customer contact center operations and program and systems consulting services.
Technology Solutions. Technology solutions offer assistance with system planning, implementation oversight and the construction and maintenance of client systems to allow processing of transactions. We also provide system implementation project management services to state and local clients, giving our customers peace of mind that their business requirements have been met on time and within budget. Consistent with our overall corporate strategy, technology solutions in our U.S. Services Segment is an area of focus for growth.
The rest of the segment's revenue is from specialized consulting services. These services include business process assessment and design, quality assurance processes, including independent verification and validation services as well as policy and procedure reviews, and audit preparation and compliance, including grant and proposal reviews. The segment also includes a tax credit service, which assists commercial customers in claiming workforce and location-based tax benefits.
Payment for our services varies from contract to contract based upon factors such as the priorities of the customer and their willingness to share risks and rewards. Some contracts are performed on a cost-plus basis, where we receive revenue based upon the hours and costs incurred and typically operate at lower margins. Most contracts include a level of performance-based compensation, a fixed fee, or a mixture of both, with fees being based upon call volumes, populations served, or appeals processed. Our employment services contracts typically have outcome-based payments in an effort to incentivize providers to ensure that we help job seekers find long-term sustained employment and achieve economic independence.
The segment may experience seasonality due to transaction-based work, such as program open enrollment periods. Other fluctuations may arise from changes in programs directed by our clients and activity related to contract life cycles. Contracts with government clients often contain "termination without cause" provisions. Such contractual language generally allows the government to terminate a contract at any time and enables us to recover only our costs incurred or committed and settlement expenses and profit, if any, on the work completed prior to termination. 
A small number of large states comprise a significant share of this segment's revenue. In addition, even though the majority of our direct clients are state governments, a significant amount of our revenue is ultimately funded via the U.S. Federal Government in the form of cost-sharing arrangements with the states, as is the case with Medicaid.
Our primary competitors are government in-sourced operations. External competitors include Conduent, Automated Health Systems, Faneuil, KePro, MTX Group, and Deloitte. In some services, we compete against specialized private companies and nonprofit organizations such as The Salvation Army and Goodwill Industries. We consider ourselves to be a significant competitor in the markets in which we operate as we are one of the largest providers of Medicaid and CHIP administrative programs and operate many of the state-based health insurance exchanges.
Outside the U.S. Segment
Our Outside the U.S. Segment generated 16% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2022.
Our Outside the U.S. Segment provides BPS for international governments and commercial clients, transforming the lives of people around the world. Helping people find employment, access vital support, and remain healthy, these services include health and disability assessments, program administration for employment services, wellbeing solutions, and other job seeker-related services. We support programs and deliver services in the U.K., including the Health Assessment Advisory Service ("HAAS") and Restart; Australia, including Workforce Australia (formerly jobactive) and Disability Employment Service; Canada, including Health Insurance British Columbia and the Employment Program of British Columbia; in addition to Italy, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, and UAE, where we predominantly provide employment support and job seeker services.
Employment Services. Comprehensive employment services help vulnerable individuals transition from government assistance programs to sustainable employment and economic independence. These services cover a number of attributes, including eligibility determination, case management, job-readiness preparation and work capability assessments, job search and employer outreach, job retention and career advancement, and selected educational and training services. Payment terms are typically focused on achieving employment outcomes.
Clinical Services. Clinical services includes appeals and assessments work. On these contracts, we are typically reimbursed for each transaction. The HAAS contract is a hybrid contract with cost-plus elements coupled with a number of incentives and penalties to achieve the programmatic outcomes defined by the government in order to ensure quality and timeliness of service to our customers. Maximus carries out these assessments on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions ("DWP"), and the DWP makes the final decision on the level of benefit. 
The balance of the segment provides program administration and some specialized services.
Seasonality is not significant to this segment. Contracts with government clients often contain "termination without cause" provisions. Such contractual language generally allows the government to terminate a contract at any time and enables us to recover only our costs incurred or committed and settlement expenses and profit, if any, on the work completed prior to termination. 
Our primary competitors in this segment include Atos, Capita, Optum, Serco, Staffline, Shaw Trust, Ingeus, Sarina Russo, Advanced Personnel Management, IBM, Telus-Health, NTT Data, Pacific Blue Cross, and other specialized private companies and nonprofit organizations. Although the basis for competition varies from contract to contract, we believe that typical contracts are awarded based upon a mix of comprehensive solution and price. In some cases, clients award points for past performance tied to program outcomes.
Economic and Market Environments 
In all the markets and locations in which we operate, we are seeing consistent themes that drive our long-term strategy.
Investment in Technology. Many federal agencies must address the maintenance of legacy IT systems and the pressing need for IT infrastructure modernization continues to grow. Legacy processes and systems are fundamental to government operations, yet they are expensive to operate in an environment that requires online agility and rapid response to new demands, requirements, and global challenges. We are delivering and supporting the priorities set by the Federal CIO: Cybersecurity, IT modernization, and customer service and customer experience. By aligning our priorities with that of the government, we believe that we are well-positioned to meet agency change and to provide enterprise-wide solutions and strategies. 
Public Health Emergency. We believe that effectively managing healthcare costs, as well as improving quality and access to healthcare, is a major policy priority for governments. This was particularly evident in the federal government's Public Health Emergency ("PHE"), which increased Medicaid funding to states that allowed ongoing eligibility of benefits. While the PHE has impacted our volumes and revenues on certain Medicaid eligibility contracts, our teams are actively preparing for the lift of the PHE by collaborating with current and prospective state clients. 
Further, President Biden has indicated that his healthcare platform will use the foundation of the ACA to expand access, lower costs, and simplify the process for individuals and families. We believe the current market environment for our services positions us to benefit from continued demand across all of our geographies in service areas such as operations program management and independent health and benefit assessments. Overall, we still expect the underlying demand for our services to increase over the next several years, particularly as economies emerge from this global health crisis.
Decentralization. The U.S. federal government recently clarified federal regulations that now allow states the flexibility to use contractors to help agencies provide services. We anticipate future changes to this operating model as states evaluate options such as replacing staff, retaining contractors, and implementing technology. We believe that these changes to funding and government mechanics allow state and local authorities enhanced flexibility to shape their benefit programs.
Unemployment. As different geographies emerge from the pandemic, we are cautiously optimistic that new opportunities for expanded employment services programs will materialize. Given our deep experience, strong financial condition, and trusted brand reputation, we believe we are well-positioned with unique competitive advantages to meet an anticipated expanded need for our services and pent-up demand to help governments provide their citizens employment opportunities. Furthermore, this segment has historically benefited from increased caseloads in employment services programs during past economic downturns and recoveries.
Competitive Advantages
Some of the competitive advantages that allow us to capitalize on various market opportunities are as follows:
Subject matter, clinical, and digital expertise. Our workforce includes many individuals who possess substantial subject matter expertise in areas critical to the successful design, implementation, administration, and operation of government health and human services programs. We also employ a diverse set of experts, including a wide network of clinicians and an experienced team of digital technologists. Many of our employees worked for governments in management positions and can offer insights into how we can best provide valuable, practical, and effective services to our clients.
Digital engagement, analytics, and automation solutions to enhance government programs. Participants in government programs expect the same types of digital engagement they rely upon when interacting with consumer-oriented businesses. We believe our clients value our ability to infuse digital, such as mobile applications, omnichannel solutions, and digital media, into our BPS solutions to make it easier for beneficiaries to engage with government programs. Analytics enable us to optimize our operations and provide our clients with improved outcomes through greater insight into the populations we serve. Process automation incorporated into our BPS solutions increases the efficiency and quality of the programs we operate.
Flexibility and scalability. We are experienced in launching large-scale complex operations under compressed time frames. We offer clients the flexibility and scalability to deliver the people, processes, and technology to complete short- and long-term contractual assignments in an efficient and cost-effective manner.
Financial strength. Our business provides us with robust cash flows from operations as a result of our profitability and our management of customer receivables. In the event that we have significant cash outlays at the commencement of projects or where delays in payments result in short-term working capital needs, we may borrow up to $600 million through a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase N.A. (the Credit Agreement), subject to standard covenants. We have the ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement in all of the principal currencies in which we operate. We believe we have strong, constructive relationships with the lenders on the Credit Agreement. We believe our financial strength provides reassurance to government agencies that we will be able to establish and maintain the services they need to operate high-profile public health and human services programs.
Focused portfolio of services. We are one of the largest publicly traded companies that provide a portfolio of BPS almost exclusively to government customers. Our government program expertise and proven ability to deliver defined, measurable outcomes differentiate us from other firms and nonprofit organizations, including large consulting firms that serve multiple industries and lack the focus necessary to manage the complexities of serving government efficiently.
Established presence outside the United States. Governments outside the U.S. are seeking to improve government-sponsored health and human services programs, manage increasing caseloads, and contain costs. We have an established presence in the U.K., Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Italy, Sweden, South Korea, and UAE. Our international efforts are focused on delivering cost-effective welfare-to-work and health benefits services to program participants on behalf of governments.
Expertise in competitive bidding. Government agencies typically award contracts through a comprehensive, complex, and competitive request for proposals ("RFP") and bidding process. Although the bidding criteria varies from contract to contract, typical contracts are awarded based upon a mix of technical solution and price. In some cases, governments award points for past performance tied to program outcomes. With more than 40 years of experience in responding to RFPs, we believe we have the necessary experience to navigate government procurement processes and to assess and allocate the appropriate resources necessary for successful project completion in accordance with contractual terms.
Barriers to entry. The market for providing our services to government agencies is competitive and subject to rapid change. However, given the specialized nature of our services, market entry can be difficult for new or inexperienced firms. The complex nature of competitive bidding, qualifying criteria related to past performance, the required investment in subject-matter expertise, repeatable processes and support infrastructure, and the need to achieve specific program outcomes creates barriers to entry for potential new competitors unfamiliar with the nature of government procurement. In some areas of our business, notably contracts with the U.S. federal government, there are requirements for bidders seeking contracts to be pre-approved on registered contract vehicles, further limiting the pool of competitors.
Human Resources
As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 39,500 employees and 12,550 contingent workers, consisting of 18,500 employees in our U.S. Federal Services Segment, 10,350 employees in the U.S. Services Segment, 8,400 employees in the Outside the U.S. Services Segment and 2,250 corporate administrative employees.
Global Core Values
In fiscal year 2022 we announced Global Core Values to establish a universal voice throughout the Company. These values focus on elements of our strategic objectives with input solicited from our employees, globally, taking into consideration not only where we are but where we want to be. The six global core values that were identified are Respect, Compassion, Innovation, Accountability, Collaboration, and Customer Focus. These values are a mix of our current beliefs and our aspirations, illustrating how we can execute our strategic objectives and look for opportunities of growth.
Talent Acquisition
Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract talent globally to meet the needs of our customers and comply with our contracts. This makes our hiring efforts significant and extensive, and as a result, our talent acquisition team focuses on finding top, diverse talent quickly. We believe our culture values individual skills, experiences, and differences that allow Maximus to deliver robust and innovative approaches to solving some of our communities' most challenging needs. Our recruiting programs focus on identifying and evaluating talent through practices that welcome a diverse workforce, including people with disabilities, language barriers, and those from varying socioeconomic backgrounds.
Demand for talent is highly competitive, with additional pressures influenced by the pandemic. We continue to invest in our employees through a variety of benefits and overall program enhancements. Our teams continue to adapt to the recruiting, hiring, and training needs of our customers in both remote and onsite settings to ensure continuity of vital services.
Talent Development
We value ongoing development and continuous learning, and we strive to support and provide learning opportunities to all Maximus employees. Maximus supports enterprise-wide professional development by offering a variety of instructor-led and self-paced learning programs for diverse audiences ranging from individual contributors to frontline supervisors and executive leadership. Additionally, our project training teams manage customized programs supporting contract requirements, customer service, local leadership development, and employee engagement. We also provide online learning tools that have role-based and skill-based paths to many of our employees.
Total Rewards
As part of our compensation philosophy, we offer and maintain market-competitive total rewards programs for our employees to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to competitive base wages, additional programs include incentive bonus opportunities, restricted stock units, company-matched 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, employee assistance programs, and supplemental programs to support our employees' physical, mental, and financial well-being.
During the fiscal year 2022, we made significant improvements to the employee value proposition, including increasing the 401(k)-employer match, removing the vesting schedule for all new matching contributions and lowering the deductible for our most populated SCA medical plan, from $4,500 to $2,500, in order to make healthcare more accessible for our mission-critical employees. We also made great strides in closing the gender and ethnicity pay gap, instituting an annual review to identify and close any new or persistent unsubstantiated differences in pay between our employees. 
We improved the hourly wage in fiscal year 2022 to at least $15 an hour for approximately 95% of our U.S. population. We also developed a plan to get the remaining contracts to that internal minimum wage and ultimately to a living wage.
Diversity and Inclusion
We assist some of the most vulnerable individuals and families each day. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are central to our company identity. We are proud to contribute to and positively impact our communities by treating every person we serve, and each other, with dignity and respect. We assert that an equitable and inclusive environment with diverse teams produces creative solutions, innovative products and services, and attracts and retains key talent. We are focused on building and sustaining a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture through a variety of initiatives, including implementing international and strategic hiring, internal development, promotions, and retention practices. In 2022, we successfully sourced and employed more than 2,500 persons with disabilities in the U.S. 70% of our U.S. hires were People of Color, and over 75% of our total U.S. hires were women. We continue to refine our focus on recruiting employees from under-represented and historically excluded groups, People of Color, and military Veterans at all levels of the organization to better reflect the populations we serve.
Employee Engagement
Our employees are essential, and their well-being is paramount. During the pandemic, we launched a global engagement survey to measure our employees’ engagement for being stewards of Maximus. Engaged employees typically stay longer, provide a better consumer experience, and influence other employees. Since we’ve launched the survey, our Global engagement score has increased by over 250%. 
Freedom of Association
Approximately 5% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or similar arrangements. No other employees are covered under any similar agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Running our Business Ethically and with Integrity
Our commitment to conduct our business ethically and with integrity extends to our responsibility to respect human rights as guided by international human rights principles. It is our duty to conduct our business through responsible workplace practices as described in the Maximus Human Rights Principles, available at www.maximus.com.
We strive to be champions for an inclusive and collaborative culture that is free from discrimination and harassment, where everyone is treated with respect and dignity. Our expectation is that Maximus and its employees always conduct business according to the highest standards of ethics and performance and in compliance with all applicable laws.
Maximus has a confidential, third-party-operated, 24/7 reporting ethics hotline. Violations of our ethics standards and policies are taken seriously and include remediation processes and disciplinary action, as applicable. Any director, officer, or employee may anonymously report suspected violations of the Maximus Standards of Business Conduct and Ethics, Company policies, or applicable laws and regulations.
The ethics hotline is a comprehensive and confidential reporting tool to assist management and employees in working together to address any type of misconduct in the workplace. Maximus is committed to an environment where open, honest communications are the expectation, not the exception. We want employees to feel comfortable in approaching a supervisor or anyone in management in instances where they believe violations of policies or standards have occurred. By creating open channels of communication, we aim to promote a positive work environment.
Employees understand our commitment to act with integrity, which is summarized in our Standards for Business Conduct and Ethics, which includes the confidential ethics hotline contact information and is available at www.maximus.com.
Cyber Security
Our government clients maintain the role as data owners and regulate access to and use of this data through extensive federal, state, and international privacy and data security laws requiring certain privacy protections and security safeguards. Our Information Security Office is led by the Chief Information Security Officer to provide oversight over the Company's security obligations, as well as a Privacy Office under the Privacy Official to provide oversight over our privacy obligations within these contracts. The Board of Directors Technology Committee provides oversight with respect to our global IT, including, but not limited to, IT infrastructure, product development, digital services portfolio, cybersecurity, IT aspects of mergers and acquisitions, and intellectual property protection. Maximus uses various technological and procedural security measures in order to protect the personal information we collect from loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. We have documented Information Security & Privacy policies to address data protection. We regularly provide information security and privacy awareness training to our employees.
Environment
Our operations may be subject to various local, state, federal, and international environmental laws and regulations. Given the nature of our business, we do not currently anticipate that the costs of complying with, or the liabilities associated with, environmental laws will materially affect us. However, we cannot ensure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future. The Board of Directors' Nominating and Governance Committee has oversight responsibility for Environment, Social, and Governance ("ESG") matters, which includes climate-related risks and opportunities.
Government Regulations
Our business is heavily regulated. In the U.S., we must adhere to local, state, and federal laws and regulations. Within the U.S. Federal Services Segment, we must also comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulations ("FAR"), which regulates the procurement, award, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts. Outside the U.S., we must also comply with local laws and regulations as determined by geography, as well as U.S. government laws. Adherence includes human rights protections, environmental regulation, and contract specifications. Our government clients have strict policies, procedures, and requirements in the procurement process, as well as regulations governing contract pricing and reimbursable costs.
Community Involvement
We aim to give back to the communities where we live and work and believe that this commitment helps in our efforts to attract and retain employees. We offer employees the opportunity to give back through the Maximus Foundation. The Foundation focuses our grant giving to carefully selected partners who have the expertise and capability to enhance our communities and the quality of life of the people we serve. We provide financial support for nonprofit organizations and charities that share our commitment in helping disadvantaged populations and underserved communities.
