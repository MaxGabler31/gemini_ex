Overview 
 We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on in-licensing, developing and commercializing novel medicines for patients living with rare diseases. With exceptional patient focus, we are committed to developing a robust pipeline of cutting-edge, best-in-class medicines for rare diseases. We historically focused our efforts on developing products that treat diseases in the neuromuscular and neurological space, but in 2021 we made a strategic decision to broaden and diversify our product portfolio through acquisitions of both early and late-stage products or companies or technology platforms in rare disease therapeutic categories outside of neuromuscular diseases. To accomplish these new priorities, we are employing a disciplined approach to evaluating assets and we believe that this strategic expansion will better position our company to build out a broader more diversified portfolio of drug candidates, which should add greater value to our company over the near and long-term. However, there can be no assurance that whatever product candidates or technology platforms we acquire, if any, will be successfully developed or commercialized. 
 We are currently exploring several potential opportunities to acquire companies with drug products in development or to in-license or acquire drug products in development. However, no definitive agreements have been entered into to date. Further, during the third quarter of 2021 we hired Dr. Preethi Sundaram, who serves as our Chief Strategy Officer. In that position, Dr. Sundaram is leading our efforts to acquire R&D assets, from early stage through late-stage clinical programs and technologies to treat rare diseases, and once such drug candidates are acquired, Dr. Sundaram will help oversee the development of those assets. 
 We are dedicated to making a meaningful impact on the lives of those suffering from rare diseases, and we believe in putting patients first in everything we do. 
 Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has affected our business operations in numerous ways, and we continue to monitor applicable government modifications. We had to make modifications to our normal operations because of the COVID-19 pandemic, including allowing our employees to work remotely. At present, our operations have returned to mostly being in-person, with some contact with physicians by our commercial sales force still being done remotely. Notwithstanding, the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, including the delta and omicron variants, could affect the health and availability of our workforce as well as those of third parties whom we are relying upon to take similar measures. As such, we have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, disruptions to our business operations because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our business could be materially adversely affected by such disruptions, directly or indirectly. National, state and local governments in affected regions have implemented and may continue to implement varying safety precautions, such as quarantines, border closures, increased border controls, travel restrictions, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns, business closures, cancellations of public gatherings and other measures. Organizations and individuals may continue to take additional steps to avoid infection, including limiting travel and staying home from work. These measures may continue to disrupt normal business operations both inside and outside of affected areas and have had significant impacts on healthcare and businesses worldwide. 
 We believe that because many healthcare providers who treat LEMS patients have delayed seeing new patients because of the pandemic, there has been a delay in the diagnosis of new LEMS patients and their initiating therapy, which has slowed our efforts to locate new patients who could benefit from our therapy. However, we believe that when conditions allow healthcare providers to resume seeing new patients in person on a regular basis, the impact of this aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will lessen. 
 One area where we have not been impacted by the pandemic is in our supply chain. To date, we have been able to avoid material disruptions in the production of FIRDAPSE® and, based upon current estimates, we have sufficient inventory to meet current and foreseeable patient needs for at least the next 12 months.

  FIRDAPSE®
On November 28, 2018, we received approval from the FDA for FIRDAPSE® Tablets 10 mg for the treatment of adult patients (ages 17 and above) with Lambert-Eaton, Myasthenic Syndrome (“LEMS”). In January 2019, we launched FIRDAPSE® in the United States. We sell our product through a field force experienced in neurologic, central nervous system or rare disease products consisting at this time of approximately 30 field personnel, including sales (Regional Account Managers), patient assistance and insurance navigation support (Patient Access Liaisons), and payor reimbursement (National Account Managers). We also have a field-based force of five medical science liaisons who are helping educate the medical communities and patients about LEMS and our programs supporting patients and access to FIRDAPSE®. 
 Further, we have contracted with an experienced inside sales agency that works to generate leads through telemarketing to targeted physicians. This inside sales agency allows our sales efforts to not only reach the neuromuscular specialists who regularly treat LEMS patients, but also the roughly 9,000 neurology and neuromuscular healthcare providers that may be treating an adult LEMS patient who can benefit from FIRDAPSE®. Additionally, we recently began non-personal promotion to oncologists that may treat adult LEMS patients. We also are continuing to make available at no-cost a LEMS voltage gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibody testing program for use by physicians who suspect that one of their patients may have LEMS and wish to reach a definitive diagnosis. 
 Finally, we are continuing to expand our digital and social media activities in order to introduce our product and services to potential patients and their healthcare providers. We also work with several rare disease advocacy organizations (including Global Genes, the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), and the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America) to help increase awareness and level of support for patients living with LEMS and to provide education for the physicians who treat these rare diseases and the patients they treat. 
 We are supporting the distribution of FIRDAPSE® through Catalyst Pathways®, our personalized treatment support program for patients who enroll in it. Catalyst Pathways® is a single source for personalized treatment support, education and guidance through the challenging dosing and titration regimen required to reach an effective therapeutic dose. It also includes distributing the drug through a very small group of exclusive specialty pharmacies (primarily AnovoRx), which is consistent with the way that most drug products for ultra-orphan diseases are distributed and dispensed to patients. We believe that by using specialty pharmacies in this way, the difficult task of navigating the health care system is far better for the patient needing treatment for their rare disease and the health care community in general. 
 In order to help adult LEMS patients afford their medication, we, like other pharmaceutical companies which are marketing drugs for ultra-orphan conditions, have developed an array of financial assistance programs that are available to reduce patient co-pays and deductibles to a nominal affordable amount. For eligible patients with commercial coverage, a co-pay assistance program designed to keep out-of-pocket costs to not more than $10.00 per month (currently $0.00 per month) is available for all LEMS patients who are prescribed FIRDAPSE®. We are also donating, and committing to continue to donate, money to qualified, independent charitable foundations dedicated to providing assistance to any U.S. LEMS patients in financial need. Subject to compliance with regulatory requirements, our goal is that no LEMS patient is ever denied access to their medication for financial reasons. 
 In May 2019, the FDA approved a New Drug Application (NDA) for Ruzurgi®, another version of amifampridine (3,4-DAP), for the treatment of pediatric LEMS patients (ages 6 to under 17). While the NDA for Ruzurgi® only covers pediatric patients, we believe that Ruzurgi® has been regularly prescribed off-label to adult LEMS patients. We also believe that the FDA’s approval of Ruzurgi® violated our statutory rights and was in multiple other respects arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law. As a result, in June 2019 we filed suit against the FDA and several related parties challenging this approval and related drug labeling, and Jacobus Pharmaceuticals (Jacobus) intervened in our case. Our complaint, which was filed in the federal district court for the Southern District of Florida, alleged that the FDA’s approval of Ruzurgi® violated multiple provisions of FDA regulations regarding labeling, resulting in misbranding in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA); violated our statutory rights to Orphan Drug Exclusivity and New Chemical Entity Exclusivity under the FDCA; and was in multiple other respects arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Among other remedies, the suit sought an order setting aside the FDA’s approval of Ruzurgi®. 
 On July 30, 2020, the Magistrate Judge considering our lawsuit against the FDA filed a Report and Recommendation in which she recommended to the District Judge handling the case that she grant the FDA’s and Jacobus’ motions for summary judgment and deny our motion for summary judgment. On September 29, 2020, the District Judge adopted the Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge, granted the FDA’s and Jacobus’ motions for summary judgment, and dismissed our case. We appealed the District Court’s decision to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. By early 2021, the case was fully briefed, and oral argument was held in March 2021. 
 On September 30, 2021, a three-judge panel of 11th Circuit judges issued a unanimous decision overturning the District Court’s decision. The appellate court adopted our argument that the FDA’s approval of Ruzurgi® violated our rights to Orphan Drug Exclusivity and remanded the case to the District Court with orders to enter summary judgment in our favor. In November 2021, Jacobus filed a motion seeking rehearing of the case from the full 11th Circuit, which motion was denied in January 2022. Further, in January 2022, Jacobus filed motions with both the 11th Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court seeking a stay of the 11th Circuit’s ruling indicating that it would seek a review of the 11th Circuit’s decision from the U.S. Supreme Court. Both stay motions were denied, and on January 28, 2022, the 11th Circuit issued a mandate directing the District Court to enter summary judgment in our favor. The District Court entered that order on January 31, 2022. On February 1, 2022, the FDA informed Jacobus that, consistent with the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit’s September 30, 2021, decision in favor of Catalyst, the final approval of the Ruzurgi® NDA was switched to a tentative approval until the 7-year orphan-drug exclusivity (ODE) for Firdapse® has expired.

  There can be no assurance as to whether Jacobus will seek U.S. Supreme Court review of the 11th Circuit’s decision, whether the U.S. Supreme Court will agree to hear the case, or whether, if the U.S. Supreme Court agrees to hear the case, Jacobus’ appeal to overturn the decision of the 11th Circuit will be successful. Similarly, there can be no assurance as to whether the U.S. Congress will pass, and the President will sign, legislation revising the Orphan Drug Act that effectively overturns the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, and whether any such legislation, if passed and signed into law, will retroactively affect the outcome of the 11th Circuit decision and allow the FDA to reinstate the approval of Ruzurgi® before the expiration of FIRDAPSE®’s orphan drug exclusivity. 
 We are actively working with parents and physicians of pediatric LEMS patients to make sure that such patients will be able to obtain FIRDAPSE® through appropriate legal and regulatory means. In addition, we are working to file an application with the FDA seeking approval for use of FIRDAPSE® by pediatric LEMS patients, though any effort to obtain such authorization is not guaranteed. We anticipate submitting the sNDA before the end of the first quarter. For the adult LEMS patients who have been taking Ruzurgi® off-label (who are believed to be a large majority of the patients currently taking Ruzurgi®), we are working with prescribers to transition such patients to FIRDAPSE® as needed. 
 We have been developing a long-acting formulation of amifampridine phosphate. While a number of formulations have been prepared, after discussions with researchers and an advisory board made up of both patients and physicians, we recently concluded that we would be unable to develop a long-acting formulation that was both beneficial to patients and commercially viable, and as a result we have made the determination not to proceed with development of this product. 
 On August 10, 2020, we announced the top-line results from our Phase 3 clinical trial (MSK-002) evaluating FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of adults with MuSK-MG. Unfortunately, the MSK-002 trial did not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint or its secondary endpoint. Following our receipt of these results, we analyzed the data and proposed a plan to FDA to perform an additional study evaluating FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of MuSK-MG. In response, the FDA provided written comments that were unfavorable towards our proposed revised study design and further questioned the ability of the initial MuSK-MG pilot study to be supportive. These remarks make it unlikely that a single study of similar design to MSK-002 would be sufficient for potential approval of the MuSK-MG indication. We also held an expert panel with key opinion leaders (KOLs) to discuss options and review the likelihood of success for the MuSK-MG indication for FIRDAPSE® under these circumstances. After receiving the input of the FDA and the KOLs, we concluded that the approval of FIRDAPSE® as a first line therapy for MuSK-MG is unlikely, and therefore we have decided not to further pursue this indication. 
 We previously announced our intent to conduct a proof-of-concept study evaluating FIRDAPSE® as a treatment for Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP). The FDA requested that a new, patient-centric endpoint be researched and used for our proposed study, without assurance that such endpoint would be acceptable for approval. Based upon the uncertainty of such an endpoint, we have decided not to conduct this study as a company-sponsored study, though there is a possibility that this study will move forward as investigator-initiated study that we will support. 
 There can be no assurance that any future clinical trials of FIRDAPSE® that we undertake will be successful. Further, there can be no assurance that we will ever be granted the right to commercialize FIRDAPSE® for any additional indications. 
 Our NDS filing for FIRDAPSE® for the symptomatic treatment of LEMS was approved by Health Canada on July 31, 2020. In August 2020, we entered into a license agreement with KYE Pharmaceuticals (KYE), pursuant to which we licensed the Canadian rights for FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of LEMS to KYE. Pursuant to the license agreement, KYE was obligated to pay us an up-front payment based on approval, a milestone upon attainment of marketing authorization and product supply, milestones based on achievements of sales and regulatory milestones, and a sharing of defined net sales following commercialization. 
 On August 10, 2020, Health Canada issued a Notice of Compliance (NOC) to Medunik for Ruzurgi® for the treatment of LEMS. We initiated a legal proceeding in Canada seeking judicial review of Health Canada’s decision to issue the NOC for Ruzurgi® as incorrect and unreasonable under Canadian law. Data protection, per Health Canada regulations, is supposed to prevent Health Canada from issuing a NOC to a drug that directly or indirectly references an innovative drug’s data, for eight years from the date of the innovative drug’s approval. The Ruzurgi® Product Monograph clearly references pivotal nonclinical carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity data for amifampridine phosphate developed by us. As such, we believe that our data was relied upon to establish the nonclinical safety profile of Ruzurgi® needed to meet the standards of the Canadian Food and Drugs Act. 
 
5 

  On June 3, 2021, we announced a positive decision in this proceeding that quashed the NOC previously issued for Ruzurgi® and remanded the matter to the Minister of Health to redetermine its decision to grant marketing authorization to Ruzurgi® in spite of FIRDAPSE®’s data protection rights. However, on June 28, 2021, we announced that Health Canada had re-issued an NOC for Ruzurgi®, once again allowing the product to be marketed in Canada for patients with LEMS. As a result, in July 2021 we, along with our partner KYE, filed a second suit against Health Canada to overturn this decision. That case was fully briefed in late 2021, with oral argument held in early December. 
 On March 11, 2022, we announced that we had received a favorable decision from the Canadian court setting aside, for the second time, the decision of Health Canada approving Ruzurgi® for the treatment of LEMS patients. In its ruling, the court determined that the Minister of Health’s approach to evaluating whether FIRDAPSE®’s data deserved protection based on FIRDAPSE®’s status as an innovative drug, which protects by regulation the use of such data as part of a submission seeking an NOC for eight years from approval of the innovative drug, was legally flawed and not supported by the evidence. As a result, the matter has, once again, been remanded to the Minister of Health to redetermine its decision in light of the court’s ruling. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of this proceeding. 
 In May 2019, we entered into an amendment to our license agreement for FIRDAPSE®. Under the amendment, we expanded our commercial territory for FIRDAPSE®, which originally was comprised of North America, to include Japan. Additionally, we have an option to further expand our territory under the license agreement to include most of Asia, as well as Central and South America, upon the achievement of certain milestones in Japan. Under the amendment, we will pay royalties to our licensor on net sales in Japan of a similar percentage to the royalties that we are currently paying under our original license agreement for North America. 
 We have reached an agreement with Japanese regulatory authorities as to the scope of the clinical trial that will be required to be completed before an application can be submitted to Japanese regulatory authorities to commercialize FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of LEMS in Japan. We also have been granted orphan drug designation in Japan for FIRDAPSE® for the symptomatic treatment of LEMS. 
 On June 28, 2021, we entered into a sub-license agreement with DyDo Pharma, Inc. (DyDo), pursuant to which we sub-licensed to DyDo the Japanese rights for FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of LEMS. Under the terms of the Agreement, DyDo will have joint rights to develop FIRDAPSE®, and exclusive rights to commercialize the product, in Japan. DyDo will be responsible for funding all clinical, regulatory, marketing and commercialization activities in Japan. We will be responsible for clinical and commercial supply, as well as providing support to DyDo in its efforts to obtain regulatory approval for the product from the Japanese regulatory authorities. Subject to the satisfaction of terms and conditions as set forth in the Agreement, we have earned an upfront payment and are eligible to receive further development and sales milestones for FIRDAPSE®, as well as revenue on product supplied to DyDo. 
 In December 2021, we announced that DyDo had initiated a Phase 3 registrational study in Japan to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of LEMS. We anticipate completion of that study sometime in 2023. There can be no assurance that this trial will be successful or that DyDo will be granted the right to commercialize FIRDAPSE® in Japan. 
 All of our patent rights for FIRDAPSE® are derived from our license agreement. In August 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) allowed Patent No. 10,793,893 (the ’893 patent) to our licensor and thereby to us, and the patent issued on October 6, 2020. The patent is directed to the use of suitable doses of amifampridine to treat patients, regardless of the therapeutic indication, that are slow metabolizers of amifampridine. Any drug product containing amifampridine with a label that states the patented dosing regimens and doses in the Dosing and Administration section prior to April 7, 2034, the expiration date of the patent, could possibly infringe this patent. Generic drug product labels would necessarily have to do this, and we intend to take all appropriate actions to protect our intellectual property. 
 In April 2021, the USPTO also allowed Patent No. 11,060,128 (the ’128 patent) to our licensor and thereby to us, and this second patent issued on July 13, 2021. The patent is directed to the use of suitable doses of amifampridine to treat patients suffering with LEMS that are slow metabolizers of amifampridine. Any drug product containing amifampridine with a label for the treatment of LEMS, that states the patented dosing regimens and doses in the Dosing and Administration section of a product label, including generic drug product labels, could possibly infringe this patent prior to this patent’s expiration date. 
 On December 24, 2021, the USPTO allowed continuing application, 17/503,190. On January 3, 2022, the USPTO allowed related continuing application 17/503,148. A further related continuing application, 17/503,092 was allowed on January 7, 2022. All three patents were issued in March 2022. The claims in each of these applications have either already been listed in the Orange Book for FIRDAPSE® or are in the process of being listed. 
 We are also pursuing additional patent applications for FIRDAPSE® in an effort to further protect our drug product. There can be no assurance that any additional patents will be issued which provide additional intellectual property protection for our drug product. 
 In that regard, in October 2020, we filed lawsuits against Jacobus and the specialty pharmacy marketing Ruzurgi®, PantherRx Rare LLC (PantherRx), for infringement of the ‘893 patent. The suits have now been consolidated in a single action in the U.S. District Court for New Jersey. Further, in August 2021, the lawsuits were amended to include alleged infringement of the ‘128 patent. The lawsuits arise from Jacobus’ and PantherRx’s sales and marketing of Ruzurgi® (amifampridine) Tablets, 10 mg. The lawsuits allege that the Ruzurgi® product infringes the ‘893 patent and the ‘128 patent when administered in accordance with its product labeling. The lawsuit seeks damages and injunctive relief to prevent further marketing of Ruzurgi® in violation of our patent rights. The lawsuit is in the discovery stage and there can be no assurance as to the results of these proceedings.

  There can be no assurance that we do not or will not infringe on patents held by third parties or that third parties in the future will not claim that we have infringed on their patents. In the event that our products or technologies infringe or violate the patent or other proprietary rights of third parties, there is a possibility we may be prevented from pursuing product development, manufacturing or commercialization of our products that utilize such technologies until the underlying patent dispute is resolved. For example, there may be patents or patent applications held by others that contain claims that our products or operations might be determined to infringe or that may be broader than we believe them to be. Given the complexities and uncertainties of patent laws, there can be no assurance as to the impact that future patent claims against us may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. 
 Generic Sabril®
In December 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement with Endo International plc’s subsidiary, Endo Ventures Limited (Endo), for the further development and commercialization of generic Sabril® tablets through Endo’s United States Generic Pharmaceuticals segment, Par Pharmaceutical. If and when the product is launched, we will be entitled to receive a milestone payment of $2.0 million on the commercial launch of the product. Further, we will receive a sharing of defined net profits upon commercialization and we are obligated to share the costs of certain development expenses. There can be no assurance that our collaboration with Endo for the development of generic Sabril® (vigabatrin) tablets will be successful and that if an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) is approved for vigabatrin tablets in the future, that it will be profitable to us. 
Capital Resources 
 At December 31, 2021, we had cash and investments of approximately $191.3 million. Based on our current financial condition and forecasts of available cash, we believe that we have sufficient funds to support our operations for at least the next 12 months. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in commercializing FIRDAPSE® or will continue to be profitable. Further, there can be no assurance that if we need additional funding in the future, whether such funding will be available to us. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further information on our liquidity and cash flow. 
Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to develop and commercialize novel prescription drugs targeting rare (orphan) neuromuscular and neurological diseases and disorders. We are dedicated to making a meaningful impact on the lives of those suffering from rare diseases, and we believe in putting patients first in everything we do. Specifically, we intend to: 

• | Continue to commercialize FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of LEMS and improve disease awareness. We are currently commercializing FIRDAPSE® in the United States and supporting its commercialization in Canada. We are working to expand awareness of the disease, including to physicians treating LEMS patients with small-cell lung cancer, and helping health care providers and their patients understand the benefits of FIRDAPSE®. A cornerstone of our U.S. strategy is our continuing development of Catalyst Pathways®, our personalized treatment support program, and our development of the patient assistance programs that are required to further our goal that no LEMS patient be denied access to FIRDAPSE® for financial reasons within existing legal restrictions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Seek approval for FIRDAPSE® in Japan. We are currently supporting our sub-licensee, DyDo, as they begin taking necessary steps to seek approval for FIRDAPSE® in Japan for the treatment of patients with LEMS.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Seek to acquire additional products. We recently made a strategic decision to broaden and diversify our product portfolio through acquisitions of both early and late-stage products or companies or technology platforms in rare disease therapeutic categories outside of neuromuscular diseases. To accomplish these new priorities, we are employing a disciplined approach to evaluating assets and we believe that this strategic expansion will better position our company to build out a broader more diversified portfolio of drug candidates, which should add greater value to our company over the near and long-term. However, no products have been acquired to date.

FIRDAPSE® Product Overview 
 FIRDAPSE® is Catalyst’s registered trade name in the United States for amifampridine phosphate tablets. Amifampridine is the WHO (World Health Organization) registered INN (International Nonproprietary Name) and United States Adopted Name (USAN) for the chemical entity, 3,4-diaminopyridine, often abbreviated as 3,4-DAP or DAP. FIRDAPSE® contains the phosphate salt of amifampridine, hence the name “amifampridine phosphate.” We will refer to our drug by its trade name in the United States (FIRDAPSE®), by the INN/USAN (amifampridine), or by the specific salt in our product (amifampridine phosphate), throughout this report.

  Amifampridine has been recommended as the first-line symptomatic treatment for LEMS by the European Federation of Neurological Societies (now known as the European Academy of Neurology). In December 2009, amifampridine phosphate received marketing approval from the European Commission (with the trade name FIRDAPSE®) for the symptomatic treatment of patients with LEMS. Safety data from clinical data published over the last 30 years in patients with LEMS or other neurological disorders treated with amifampridine show that amifampridine is well tolerated at doses up to 80 mg per day. Among the 1,279 patients or healthy subjects assessed in the literature, the most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) were perioral and peripheral paresthesias (unusual sensations like pins and needles), and gastrointestinal disorders (abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and epigastralgia (pain around the upper part of the stomach)). These events were typically mild or moderate in severity, and transient, seldom requiring dose reduction or withdrawal from treatment. 
 Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) 
 Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) is a rare autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized primarily by muscle weakness of the limbs. The disease is caused by an autoimmune reaction where antibodies are formed against voltage-gated calcium channels on nerve endings, which damages the channels. These calcium channels are responsible for the transport of charged calcium atoms that activate the biochemical machinery responsible for releasing acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter responsible for causing muscles to contract and the failure to release enough of this neurotransmitter results in muscle weakness in LEMS patients. Additionally, LEMS is often associated with an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), and in some individuals, LEMS is the first symptom of such malignancy. 
 LEMS generally affects the extremities, especially the legs. As LEMS most affects the parts of limbs closest to the trunk, difficulties with climbing stairs or rising from a sitting position are commonly reported. Physical exercise and high temperatures tend to worsen the symptoms. Other symptoms often seen include weakness of the muscles of the mouth, throat, and eyes. Individuals affected with LEMS also may have a disruption of the autonomic nervous system, including dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, impaired sweating, and/or hypotension. 
 LEMS is managed by treating the symptoms or treating the underlying autoimmune attack on voltage gated calcium channels. Unapproved treatments include steroids, azathioprine and intravenous immunoglobulin, which work by suppressing the immune system; and pyridostigmine and amifampridine, which enhance neuromuscular transmission. Plasma exchange has also been used to attempt to remove antibodies from the body. FIRDAPSE® is a symptomatic treatment and does not alter the underlying autoimmune condition. As a voltage gated potassium blocker, FIRDAPSE® prevents charged potassium atoms from leaving the nerve cells, which prolongs the period of depolarization. This allows more charged calcium atoms to enter the nerves, which enables the nerves to release acetylcholine and causes muscles to contract and to restore lost muscle strength in LEMS patients. 
 Based on currently available information, we estimate that there are approximately 3,000 LEMS patients in the United States, approximately 1,500 of which are presently diagnosed and identified and approximately 1,500 of which we believe are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. However, until awareness of the disease is increased, it is unlikely that the total number of LEMS patients in the United States can be determined with better certainty (as is typical of rare diseases), and the actual number of patients in the United States with LEMS may be higher or lower than our estimate. 
 Some of the factors that affect the size of the population with a rare disease such as LEMS include the number of patients actually diagnosed with the disease, the number of patients who are misdiagnosed with other diseases, and the number of patients who are simply undiagnosed. Additionally, while there is an antibody test that positively identifies patients with LEMS which we offer at no cost to health-care providers to be used to definitively determine whether a patient has LEMS, the test is not particularly well known or utilized at this time by many neurologists. Further, many LEMS patients who have small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are not currently being treated for LEMS because many oncology medical professionals who treat SCLC patients are generally unfamiliar with how to diagnose and treat LEMS. All of these factors affect the ultimate number of patients who will benefit from treatment with FIRDAPSE®. 
 License Agreement for FIRDAPSE®
On October 26, 2012, we licensed the exclusive North American rights to FIRDAPSE® pursuant to a License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) between us and BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (‘BioMarin”). Under the License Agreement, we make the following royalty payments on our net sales of FIRDAPSE®: 
 

• | Royalties to the licensor for seven years from the first commercial sale of FIRDAPSE® equal to 7% of net sales (as defined in the License Agreement) in North America for any calendar year for sales up to $100 million, and 10% of net sales in North America in any calendar year in excess of $100 million; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Royalties to the third-party licensor of the rights sublicensed to us for seven years from the first commercial sale of FIRDAPSE® equal to 7% of net sales (as defined in the License Agreement between BioMarin and the third-party licensor) in any calendar year for the duration of any pending or issued patents or regulatory exclusivity within a territory and 3.5% of net sales in any calendar year in territories without pending or issued patents or regulatory exclusivity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  On May 29, 2019, we entered into an amendment to our License Agreement. Under the amendment, we expanded our commercial territory for FIRDAPSE®, which originally was comprised of North America, to include Japan. Additionally, we have an option to further expand our territory under the License Agreement to include most of Asia, as well as Central and South America, upon the achievement of certain milestones in Japan. Under the amendment, we will pay royalties on net sales in Japan of a similar percentage to the royalties that we are currently paying under our original License Agreement for North America. 
 In January 2020, we were advised that BioMarin had sold certain rights under the License Agreement to SERB SA. 
 We believe that we remain in compliance with our obligations under the License Agreement. 
 Clinical trials supporting our NDA for FIRDAPSE® for LEMS and approval of our NDA 
 We conducted two successful Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of LEMS. The results of the first trial published in 2016 in Muscle & Nerve (Muscle Nerve, 2016, 53(5):717-725). The results of the second trial were published in March 2019 in the Journal of Clinical Neuromuscular Disease (J. Clin Neuromusc Dis 2019; 20:111-119).
In March 2018, we submitted an NDA seeking approval of FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of LEMS. Our NDA was accepted for filing in May 2018 and, on November 28, 2018, the FDA granted approval of FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of LEMS in adult patients. 
 Required Post-Approval Studies 
 As part of the approval of our NDA for FIRDAPSE® for LEMS, the FDA required us to conduct a clinical trial to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the exposure of amifampridine after oral administration of FIRDAPSE® relative to that in subjects with normal hepatic function. This study was recently completed and submitted to the FDA. We have also established a pregnancy surveillance program to collect and analyze information for a minimum of ten (10) years on pregnancy complications and birth outcomes related to FIRDAPSE®. Finally, the FDA required us to perform a second carcinogenicity study of amifampridine phosphate in mice, which we have completed and submitted to the FDA. 
 Expanded access program 
 We operate an expanded access program (EAP) that is currently making FIRDAPSE® available to a limited number of patients diagnosed with CMS or Downbeat Nystagmus (DN). It is anticipated that the EAP may be used to make FIRDAPSE® available to pediatric LEMS patients now that the Ruzurgi® approval has been vacated, subject to applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 Launch of FIRDAPSE® in January 2019 
 In January 2019, we launched FIRDAPSE® in the United States through a field force of approximately 20 personnel who are experienced in neurologic, central nervous system or rare diseases in sales, patient support and payer reimbursement. The sales representatives (Regional Account Managers) who were part of the field force targeted approximately 1,250 physicians who are either neuromuscular specialists or general neurologists with a known adult LEMS patient or specific training in neuromuscular diseases. We also utilized field force Patient Access Liaisons who work with the patients and provider offices to help navigate the insurance landscape, as well as National Account Managers who work directly with the payors to ensure comprehensive coverage for FIRDAPSE® across the commercial and governmental plans in the United States. We also have a field-based force of five medical science liaisons who help educate the medical communities and patients about LEMS and about our company’s ongoing clinical trial activities. Further, we work closely with several rare disease advocacy organizations (including Global Genes, the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), and the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America) to help increase awareness and the level of support for patients living with LEMS, MuSK antibody positive myasthenia gravis, and other neuromuscular diseases that may be treatable with FIRDAPSE®, and to provide education for the physicians who treat these rare diseases and the patients they treat. 
 In early 2020, we expanded our field sales group by almost one hundred percent and established a partnership with an experienced inside sales agency generating leads through telemarketing to targeted physicians. Through this expansion of our sales team, we are working to expand our sales efforts beyond the neuromuscular specialists who regularly treat LEMS patients to reach roughly 9,000 neurology and neuromuscular healthcare providers that might be treating an adult LEMS patient who can benefit from FIRDAPSE®. We also make available a no-cost LEMS voltage gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibody testing program for physicians who suspect their patient may have LEMS and wish to reach a definitive diagnosis. 
 
9 

  We are supporting the distribution of FIRDAPSE® through Catalyst Pathways®, our personalized treatment support program for enrolled patients. Catalyst Pathways® is a single source for personalized treatment support, education and guidance through the challenging dosing and titration regimen to an effective therapeutic dose. It also includes distributing the drug through a very small group of exclusive specialty pharmacies (primarily AnovoRx), which is consistent with the way that most drug products for ultra-orphan diseases are distributed and dispensed to patients. By using specialty pharmacies in this way, the difficult task of navigating the health care system is far better for the patient needing treatment for their rare disease and the health care community in general. 
 In addition, Catalyst Pathways® is the gateway for our free bridge medication for patients during transitioning from investigational product while they are waiting for a coverage determination or, later on, for patients whose access is threatened by the bureaucratic complications arising from a change of insurer. The Catalyst Pathways® program is also the access point for our Patient Assistance Program, which provides longer-term free medication for those who are uninsured or functionally uninsured with respect to FIRDAPSE® because they may be unable to obtain coverage from their payer despite having health insurance. 
 In addition to our current work to assist former Ruzurgi® patients to transition to FIRDAPSE®, we are continuing efforts on the longer, slower process to identify patients and their physicians who have diagnosed LEMS, but have not had access, awareness or understanding of this treatment for their rare disease. These patients often do not see their physician frequently, have many questions about changing treatment(s), and may not perceive the need to change to a new therapy. Further, we have begun to focus our commercial efforts to locate misdiagnosed and undiagnosed LEMS patients and provide educational and sales activities to help improve the diagnosis, understanding of the treatment, and information on the prescribing process. We plan to continue to support LEMS and rare disease patient organizational groups’ efforts to generate awareness and educate patients and physicians on the diagnosis of LEMS, the impact of the disease, and the support services and treatments available. 
 Access to FIRDAPSE®
In order to help patients afford their medication, we, like other pharmaceutical companies who are marketing drugs for ultra-orphan conditions, have developed an array of financial assistance programs that are available to reduce patient co-pays and deductibles to a nominal affordable amount. For eligible patients with commercial coverage, a co-pay assistance program designed to keep out-of-pocket costs to $10 or less per month (currently $0.00 per month) is available for all LEMS patients prescribed FIRDAPSE®. We are also donating, and committing to continue to donate, money to qualified, independent charitable foundations dedicated to providing assistance to LEMS patients in financial need. Our goal is to ensure that no LEMS patient is ever denied access to their medication for financial reasons. 
 To date, FIRDAPSE® has been widely covered and reimbursed by private and public payors for the indicated small population of adult LEMS patients. 
 FDA approval of Ruzurgi® for pediatric LEMS patients (ages 6 to under 17) 
 In May 2019, the FDA approved an NDA for Ruzurgi®, Jacobus Pharmaceuticals’ version of amifampridine (3,4-DAP), for the treatment of pediatric LEMS patients (ages 6 to under 17). We believe that the vast majority of Ruzurgi® sales are to adult LEMS patients who are being prescribed the drug off label. If Jacobus is able to successfully continue to sell Ruzurgi® off-label to additional adult LEMS patients, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We believe that the FDA’s approval of Ruzurgi® violated our statutory rights and was in multiple other respects arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law. As a result, in June 2019 we filed suit against the FDA and several related parties challenging this approval and related drug labeling. Jacobus later intervened in the case. Our complaint, which was filed in the federal district court for the Southern District of Florida, alleged that the FDA’s approval of Ruzurgi® violated multiple provisions of FDA regulations regarding labeling, resulting in misbranding in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA); violated our statutory rights to Orphan Drug Exclusivity and New Chemical Entity Exclusivity under the FDCA; and was in multiple other respects arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Among other remedies, the suit seeks an order vacating the FDA’s approval of Ruzurgi®. 
 On July 30, 2020, the Magistrate Judge considering this lawsuit filed a Report and Recommendation in which she recommended to the District Judge handling the case that she grant the FDA’s and Jacobus’ motions for summary judgment and deny our motion for summary judgment. On September 29, 2020, the District Judge adopted the Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge, granted the FDA’s and Jacobus’ motions for summary judgment, and dismissed our case. We appealed the District Court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. The case was fully briefed in early 2021, and oral argument was held in March 2021. 
 On September 30, 2021, a three-judge panel of 11th Circuit judges issued a unanimous decision overturning the District Court’s decision. The appellate court adopted our argument that the FDA’s approval of Ruzurgi® violated our rights to Orphan Drug Exclusivity and remanded the case to the District Court with orders to enter summary judgment in our favor. In November 2021, Jacobus filed a motion 
 
10 

  seeking rehearing of the case from the full 11th Circuit, which motion was denied in January 2022. Further, in January 2022, Jacobus filed motions with both the 11th Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court seeking a stay of the 11th Circuit’s ruling indicating that it would seek a review of the 11th Circuit’s decision from the U.S. Supreme Court. Both stay motions were denied, and on January 28, 2022, the 11th Circuit issued a mandate directing the District Court to enter summary judgment in our favor. The District Court entered that order on January 31, 2022. On February 1, 2022, the FDA informed Jacobus that, consistent with the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit’s September 30, 2021, decision in favor of Catalyst, the final approval of the Ruzurgi® NDA was switched to a tentative approval until the 7-year orphan-drug exclusivity (ODE) for Firdapse® has expired. 
 There can be no assurance as to whether Jacobus will seek U.S. Supreme Court review of the 11th Circuit’s decision, whether the U.S. Supreme Court will agree to hear the case, or whether, if the U.S. Supreme Court agrees to hear the case, Jacobus’ appeal to overturn the decision of the 11th Circuit will be successful. Similarly, there can be no assurance as to whether the U.S. Congress will pass, and the President will sign, legislation revising the Orphan Drug Act that effectively overturns the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, and whether any such legislation, if passed and signed into law, will retroactively affect the outcome of the 11th Circuit decision and allow the FDA to reinstate the approval of Ruzurgi® before the expiration of FIRDAPSE®’s orphan drug exclusivity. 
 Third-Party Reimbursement 
 Sales of drug products depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third party payors, such as state and federal governments, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private commercial insurance plans and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) plans. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and the amount of reimbursement to be provided for FIRDAPSE® are expected to be made on a plan-by-plan, and in some cases, on a patient-by-patient basis. Particularly given the rarity of LEMS, our experience has been that securing coverage and appropriate reimbursement from third-party payors requires targeted education and highly skilled insurance navigation experts that have experience with rare disease launches and medical exception processes at insurance companies to provide patient coverage for important rare disease therapies. To that end, we have engaged a dedicated team of field-based market access account managers and reimbursement experts as well as a patient service center staffed with experienced personnel focused on ensuring that clinically-qualified patients have access to our product. 
 There can be no assurance, however, as to whether payors will continue to cover our product, and if so, at what level of reimbursement. In that regard, we have advised payors that we will provide free medication to support titration and confirm patient therapeutic benefit. Further, when necessary, we provide patients with access to therapy at no charge while those patients are awaiting coverage decisions. 
 Our efforts to develop FIRDAPSE® as a treatment for additional neuromuscular indications 
 Over the past few years, we have studied FIRDAPSE® as a potential treatment for multiple neuromuscular indications other than LEMS, and the results of recent studies are summarized below. Based on the results of these activities, in 2021 we have made a strategic decision not to proceed forward to further study FIRDAPSE® as a potential treatment for additional indications. 
 MuSK-MG studies 
 In February 2016, we initiated an investigator-sponsored, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of FIRDAPSE® as a symptomatic treatment for patients with MuSK-MG. Seven patients participated in this proof-of-concept trial. On March 15, 2017, we reported top-line results from this trial. Both of the co-primary efficacy endpoints of change from baseline (CFB) in total Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score (p=0.0003) and CFB in total Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score (p=0.0006) were statistically and clinically significant in this trial. Several secondary efficacy measures also achieved statistical significance. Amifampridine phosphate was well tolerated in this population of patients. The results of this study were published in SAGE Open Medicine and can be accessed at https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2050312118819013. Subsequently, we engaged in a Phase 3 clinical trial (MSK-002) evaluating FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of adults with MuSK-MG. Our trial was a multi-site, international (United States, Italy and Serbia), double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) with the FDA. The trial enrolled more than 60 MuSK antibody positive patients. It also enrolled more than 10 generalized myasthenia gravis patients who were assessed with the same clinical endpoints. However, achieving statistical significance in this subgroup of patients was not required. 
 On August 10, 2020, we announced the top-line results from our Phase 3 clinical trial (MSK-002) evaluating FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of adults with MuSK-MG. Unfortunately, the MSK-002 trial did not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint or its secondary endpoint, even though clinical improvement was observed by patients and investigators during the initial dose-titration period of the trial and in the company’s previous proof-of-concept trial. However, we have recently concluded a detailed analysis of the data from this trial in an effort to understand why the MuSK-MG Phase 3 trial did not meet statistical significance on its endpoints. 
 
11 

  Following our receipt of these results, we analyzed the data and proposed a plan to the FDA to perform an additional study evaluating FIRDAPSE® for MuSK-MG. In response, the FDA provided written comments that were unfavorable towards our proposed revised study design and further questioned the ability of the initial MuSK-MG pilot study to be supportive. These remarks make it unlikely that a single study design similar to MSK-002 would be sufficient for potential approval of the MuSK-MG indication. We also held an appropriate expert panel to discuss options and review the likelihood for success for a MuSK-MG indication for FIRDAPSE®. Based on the input from the FDA and advisors, we have concluded that the approval of FIRDAPSE® as a first-line therapy for MuSK-MG is unlikely and therefore we have decided not to continue to pursue this indication. 
 Proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating FIRDAPSE® for the treatment of SMA Type 3
Our exploratory study, SMA-001 (A Randomized Placebo Controlled Crossover Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Amifampridine Phosphate in Ambulatory Patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 3, met the primary endpoint of a statistically significant difference for the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE). Clinically, however, the effect was modest. The secondary endpoints were not statistically significant, although several individual quality of life measures demonstrated a positive nominally statistically significant change. Key opinion leaders with whom we have spoken believed that FIRDAPSE® needed to show a large clinically significant change if there was the possibility to affect disease progression through retrograde signaling from enhanced neuromuscular junction function. After considering all of these factors, we have concluded that the modest results exhibited in this study are unlikely to result in a sufficient modification of disease progression, and, particularly in light of the fact that there are now three approved disease modifying medications for SMA Type 3, we have decided not to pursue the SMA Type 3 indication further. 
 Study to evaluate FIRDAPSE® as a treatment for HNPP 
 We previously announced our intent to conduct a proof-of-concept study evaluating FIRDAPSE® as a treatment for Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP). The FDA requested that a new, patient centric endpoint be researched and used for our proposed study, without assurance that such endpoint would be acceptable for approval. Based upon the uncertainty of such an endpoint, we have decided not to conduct this study as a company sponsored study, though there is a possibility that this study will move forward as investigator-initiated study that we will support. 
 Long-acting version of amifampridine phosphate 
 We were previously developing a long-acting formulation of amifampridine phosphate. While a number of formulations were prepared, after discussions with researchers and an advisory board made up of both patients and physicians, we concluded that we would be unable to develop a long-acting formulation that is both beneficial to patients and commercially viable, and as a result we made the determination not to proceed with development of this product. 
 Intellectual property and regulatory exclusivity protections for FIRDAPSE®
All of our patent rights for FIRDAPSE® are derived from our license agreement. In August 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) allowed Patent No. 10,793,893 (the ’893 patent) to our licensor and thereby to us, and the patent issued on October 6, 2020. The patent is directed to the use of suitable doses of amifampridine to treat patients, regardless of the therapeutic indication, that are slow metabolizers of amifampridine. Any drug product containing amifampridine with a label that states the patented dosing regimens and doses in the Dosing and Administration section prior to April 7, 2034, the expiration date of the patent, could possibly infringe this patent. Generic drug product labels would necessarily have to do this, and we intend to take all appropriate actions to protect our intellectual property. 
 In April 2021, the USPTO also allowed Patent No. 11,060,128 (the ’128 patent) to our licensor and thereby to us, and this second patent issued on July 13, 2021. The patent is directed to the use of suitable doses of amifampridine to treat patients suffering with LEMS that are slow metabolizers of amifampridine. Any drug product containing amifampridine with a label for the treatment of LEMS, that states the patented dosing regimens and doses in the Dosing and Administration section of a product label, including generic drug product labels, could possibly infringe this patent prior to this patent’s expiration date. 
 On December 24, 2021, the USPTO allowed continuing application, 17/503,190. On January 3, 2022, the USPTO allowed related continuing application 17/503,148. A further related continuing application, 17/503,092 was allowed on January 7, 2022. All three patents were issued in March 2022. The claims in each of these applications have either already been listed in the Orange Book for FIRDAPSE® or are in the process of being listed. 
 We are also pursuing additional patent applications for FIRDAPSE® in an effort to further protect our drug product. There can be no assurance that any additional patents will be issued which provide additional intellectual property protection for our drug product. 
 In that regard, in October 2020, we filed lawsuits against Jacobus and the specialty pharmacy marketing Ruzurgi®, PantherRx Rare LLC (PantherRx), for infringement of the ‘893 patent. The suits have now been consolidated in a single action in the U.S. District Court for New Jersey. In August 2021, the lawsuits were amended to include alleged infringement of the ‘128 patent. The lawsuits arise from 
 
12 

  Jacobus’ and PantherRx’s sales and marketing of Ruzurgi® (amifampridine) Tablets, 10 mg. The lawsuits allege that the Ruzurgi® product infringes the ‘893 patent and the ‘128 patent when administered in accordance with its product labeling. The lawsuit seeks damages and injunctive relief to prevent further marketing of Ruzurgi® in violation of our patent rights. The lawsuit is in the discovery stage and there can be no assurance as to the results of these proceedings. 
 There can be no assurance that we do not or will not infringe on patents held by third parties or that third parties in the future will not claim that we have infringed on their patents. In the event that our products or technologies infringe or violate the patent or other proprietary rights of third parties, we may be prevented from pursuing product development, manufacturing or commercialization of our products that utilize such technologies. For example, there may be patents or patent applications held by others that contain claims that our products or operations might be determined to infringe or that may be broader than we believe them to be. Given the complexities and uncertainties of patent laws, there can be no assurance as to the impact that future patent claims against us may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. 
 Until FIRDAPSE® was approved in November 2018, no drug product containing amifampridine for any indication had been approved by the FDA such that we received five-year “new chemical entity” exclusivity from the FDA. New chemical entity exclusivity provides a five-year period of marketing exclusivity for all indications and in the absence of an Orange Book listed patent, precludes a generic from submitting an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) until that five year period has expired. Further, when FIRDAPSE® was approved for the treatment of LEMS patients, we received seven-year orphan drug exclusivity for our product for the treatment of LEMS, precluding a generic filer from receiving final FDA approval until the ODE exclusivity period has expired. Because we have Orange Book listed patents for FIRDAPSE®, potential generic filers will be permitted to submit ANDA filings to the FDA as early as the “NCE-1” date (November 28, 2022). In the event of such filings, and after appropriate investigation, we intend to vigorously enforce our patent rights. 
 We have in-licensed the FIRDAPSE® trademark, and the trademark was registered in the United States in March 2015. 
 Protection of our intellectual property and regulatory exclusivities is a strategic priority for our business. Our ability to protect and use our intellectual property rights and regulatory exclusivity in the future development and commercialization of our products, operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights, is crucial to our future success. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
 Generic Sabril®
In September 2015, we announced the launch of a program to develop our version of vigabatrin (CPP-109) as a generic version of Sabril®, which is marketed in the United States by Lundbeck. Lundbeck’s exclusivity for Sabril® expired on April 26, 2018. Vigabatrin comes in two dosage forms – a powder sachet and a tablet. Par Pharmaceutical brought the first generic version of the powder sachet to market, and since then numerous additional generic versions of this product have been approved. Further, four generic versions of vigabatrin tablets have also been approved. 
 On December 18, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement with Endo International plc’s subsidiary, Endo Ventures Limited (Endo), for the further development and commercialization of generic Sabril® tablets through Endo’s United States Generic Pharmaceuticals segment, Par Pharmaceutical. Pursuant to the agreement, in December 2018, we received an up-front payment of $0.5 million. We will be entitled to receive a milestone payment of $2.0 million on the commercial launch of the product. Further, we will receive a sharing of defined net profits upon commercialization and certain expenses for development. 
 Sabril® is marketed by Lundbeck in the United States for infantile spasms and for refractory complex partial seizures. Lundbeck’s sales of Sabril® (tablets and sachets) were approximately $129.0 million in 2019 and $118.3 million in 2020. Four generic versions of Sabril® tablets have been approved to date in the United States, as have numerous generic versions of the powder form. We have entered into a definitive agreement with Endo/Par for the further development and commercialization of generic Sabril® tablets. 
 There can be no assurance that our collaboration with Endo for the development of generic Sabril® (vigabatrin) tablets will be successful and that if an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) is approved for vigabatrin tablets in the future, that it will be profitable to us. 
 Plans to Acquire or In-License Additional Products 
 In 2021, we made a strategic decision to broaden and diversify our product portfolio through acquisitions of both early and late-stage products or companies or technology platforms in rare disease therapeutic categories outside of neuromuscular diseases. To accomplish these new priorities, we are employing a disciplined approach to evaluating assets and we believe that this strategic expansion will better position our company to build out a broader more diversified portfolio of drug candidates, which should add greater value to our company over the near and long-term. However, there can be no assurance that whatever product candidates or technology platforms we acquire, if any, will be successfully developed or commercialized. 
 
13 

  We are currently exploring several potential opportunities to acquire companies with drug products in development or to in-license or acquire drug products in development. However, no definitive agreements have been entered into to date. Further, during the third quarter of 2021 we hired Dr. Preethi Sundaram, who serves as our Chief Strategy Officer. In that position, Dr. Sundaram is leading our efforts to acquire R&D assets, from early stage through late-stage clinical programs and technologies to treat rare diseases, and once such drug candidates are acquired, Dr. Sundaram will help oversee the development of those assets. 
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 We are licensed in Florida as a virtual drug manufacturer, which means that we have no in-house manufacturing capacity and we are obligated to rely on contract manufacturers and packagers. We have no plans to build or acquire the manufacturing capability needed to manufacture any of our research materials or commercial products, and we expect that our drug products and drug substances will be prepared by contractors with suitable capabilities for these tasks and that we will enter into appropriate supply agreements with these contractors at appropriate times in the development and commercialization of our products. Because we will use contractors to manufacture and supply our products, we will be reliant on such contractors. Further, the contractors selected would have to be inspected by the FDA and found to be in substantial compliance with federal regulations in order for an application for one of our drug candidates to be approved, and there can be no assurance that the contractors we select would pass such an inspection. 
 We have entered into agreements with a supplier of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) contained in FIRDAPSE® for future requirements and we have contracted with third-party contract manufacturers who are manufacturing FIRDAPSE® tablets for us. 
 Any significant change that we make for FIRDAPSE® must be approved by the FDA in a supplemental new drug application (sNDA). If the manufacturing plan and data are insufficient, any sNDA we submit will not be approved. Before an sNDA can be approved, our manufacturers must also demonstrate compliance with FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) regulations and policies. Further, even if we receive approval of any sNDAs for FIRDAPSE®, if our manufacturers do not follow cGMPs in the manufacture of our products, it may delay product launches or shipments and adversely affect our business. 
 Since we contract with third parties to manufacture our products, our contract manufacturers are required to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect the manufacturing process. As a result, we do not believe that we will have any significant direct exposure to environmental issues. 
 Competition 
 The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive, and any product candidate developed or licensed by us would likely compete with currently marketed and potentially new drugs and therapies even though they are not indicated for these conditions. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies and research organizations that compete with us in developing various approaches to the treatment of orphan diseases. Many of these organizations have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and manufacturing resources than we have. 
 Before the approval of FIRDAPSE®, LEMS was generally treated with unapproved drugs and therapies including steroids, azathioprine, other immunosuppressants and intravenous immunoglobulin, which work by suppressing the immune system, and pyridostigmine. Plasma exchange has also been used in an attempt to remove antibodies from the body. Further, one other product, guanidine HCl tablets, was approved many years ago (during a period when drugs were not required to be reviewed by the FDA for both safety and effectiveness) for use in the treatment of LEMS. However, this drug has significant side effects and is not currently viewed as an effective treatment for LEMS. Notwithstanding, drugs may be prescribed by physicians for the treatment of LEMS whether or not they are considered effective. 
 For some years, Ruzurgi® for the treatment of pediatric patients with LEMS was often proscribed to adult LEMS patients, and at a lower price than FIRDAPSE®. Now that Ruzurgi® is no longer on the market, it is no longer competitive to FIRDAPSE®. However, if Ruzurgi® were to become available in the future, it would likely be competitive to FIRDAPSE®. 
 Finally, we are aware that amifampridine has been available from compounding pharmacies for many years and may remain available, even though we have obtained FDA approval of FIRDAPSE®. Compounded amifampridine is likely to be substantially less expensive than FIRDAPSE®. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 included a new section, which clarified the status of pharmacy compounding under Federal law. Under Section 503A, drug products that are lawfully compounded by a pharmacist or physician for an individual patient may be entitled to exemptions from three key provisions of the FDCA: (1) the adulteration provision of section 501(a)(2)(B) (concerning FDA’s cGMP regulations); (2) the misbranding provision of section 502(f)(1) (concerning the labeling of drugs with adequate directions for use); and (3) the new drug provision of section 505 (concerning the approval of drugs under new drug or abbreviated new drug applications). 
 
14 

  To qualify for these statutory exemptions, a compounded drug product must satisfy several legal requirements. One of these requirements restricts the universe of bulk drug substances that a compounder may use. Specifically, every bulk drug substance used in compounding: (1) must comply with an applicable and current USP or NF drug monograph, if one exists, as well as the current USP chapters on pharmacy compounding; (2) if such a monograph does not exist, the bulk drug substance must be a component of an FDA-approved drug; or (3) if a monograph does not exist and the bulk drug substance is not a component of an FDA-approved drug, it must appear on a list of bulk drug substances that may be used in compounding (i.e., the “Section 503A bulk substances list 1”). While the advertising provisions in Section 503A were ruled unconstitutional in part in the United States by the Supreme Court in 2002, the FDA, since 2013, has aggressively regulated and exercised oversight over the practice of pharmacy compounding following the compounding incident at the New England Compounding Center in Massachusetts that sickened hundreds and killed over 60 individuals. 
 In 2013, Congress removed the unconstitutional advertising provisions in Section 503A when it passed the Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (DQSA), Title I (The Compounding Quality Act). The DQSA also created “outsourcing facilities” under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which are drug compounders that voluntarily register with FDA and may produce compounded formulations for office use (at least one of which must be sterile), but must comply with FDA’s cGMP regulations and other requirements set forth in Section 503B. Section 503B outsourcing facilities may also only compound from bulk substances if the product is on FDA’s drug shortage list, or the substance is on FDA’s Section 503B list of bulk substances that may be used in compounding (i.e., the Section 503B bulk substances list 1”). 
 While the FDA has been aggressively enforcing Section 503A since its re-enactment, compounders may still compound “near copies” (but not “essentially copies”) of approved drug products, under Section 503A, so long as the prescriber makes a change to the compounded formulation that produces for that patient a significant difference between the commercially available drug and the compounded version. Compounders may also copy commercially available products if they do not do so in “regular or inordinate amounts.” In January 2018, FDA published a Final Guidance document titled, “Compounded Drug Products That Are Essentially Copies of a Commercially Available Drug Product Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.” This Final Guidance sets forth FDA’s enforcement policy concerning those compounders that make essentially copies of commercially available drug products. FDA has defined the term “regular or inordinate” in the Final Guidance to mean: “a drug product that is essentially a copy of a commercially available drug product is compounded regularly or in inordinate amounts if it is compounded more frequently than needed to address unanticipated, emergency circumstances, or in more than the small quantities needed to address unanticipated, emergency circumstances.” FDA has further stated it will not take enforcement action, considering all the facts and circumstances, against a compounder that compounds less than four “essentially copies” of a commercially available drug product in a calendar month.

  Regulatory Matters 
 Government regulation and product approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, record-keeping, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our drugs must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. 
 In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and implementing regulations, as well as other federal and state statutes. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

• | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and which must include approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before the trials are initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use conducted in compliance with federal regulations and good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to, and acceptance by, the FDA of an NDA;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------


The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain. 
 United States drug development process 
 Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development it enters the pre-clinical testing stage. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. Prior to beginning human clinical trials, an IND sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA. The IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some pre-clinical or non-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the pre-clinical studies, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30–day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may, at any time, impose a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with federal regulations and GCP. 
 
16 

  Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before any clinical trial commences at that institution. All research subjects must provide informed consent, and informed consent information must be submitted to the IRB for approval prior to initiation of the trial. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if adverse events or other certain types of other changes occur. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three phases. A fourth, or post-approval, phase may include additional clinical studies. These phases generally include the following, and may be sequential, or may overlap or be combined: 
 

• | Phase 1 clinical trials involve the initial introduction of the drug into human subjects. These studies are designed to determine the safety of usually single doses of the compound and determine any dose limiting intolerance, as well as evidence of the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of the drug in humans.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In Phase 3, if a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 (or occasionally Phase 1) studies, the Phase 3 studies will be conducted to further confirm clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded population which may involve geographically diverse clinical trial sites. Generally, but not always, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4 clinical trials are studies required of or agreed to by a sponsor that are conducted after the FDA has approved a product for marketing. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations. If the FDA approves a product while a company has ongoing clinical trials that were not necessary for approval, a company may be able to use the data from these clinical trials to meet all or part of any Phase 4 clinical trial requirement. Failure to promptly conduct Phase 4 clinical trials where necessary could result in withdrawal of approval for products approved under accelerated approval regulations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


While Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 tests are generally required for approval of an NDA, certain drugs may not require one or more steps in the process depending on other testing and the situation involved. Additionally, the FDA, an IRB, or the sponsor may stop testing at any time if results show patients being exposed to unnecessary health risks or overly dangerous side effects. 
 In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other requirements, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 United States review and approval process 
 FDA approval of an NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the chemistry, manufacture and composition of the product. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of the NDA to review the application to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before filing it. The FDA may request additional information rather than file an NDA. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA files it. Once the submission is filed, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The submission of an NDA is also subject to the payment of a substantial application fee (for FDA fiscal year 2022 this fee is $3,117,218), although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances, including when the drug that is subject of the application has received Orphan Drug Designation for the indication sought. Further, the sponsor of an approved NDA is subject to an annual program fee, which for FDA fiscal year 2022 is $369,413 per prescription drug product. User fees typically increase annually. The approval process is lengthy and difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that 
 
17 

  the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured to determine whether its manufacturing is cGMP–compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, purity and stability. 
 If the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA submission or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will issue a complete response letter. The complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and often requires additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even after submitting this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. With limited exceptions, the FDA may withhold approval of an NDA regardless of prior advice it may have provided or commitments it may have made to the sponsor. 
 Once an NDA is approved, changes to the conditions of approval, including additional indications, are made by the submission of a supplement to the NDA. The supplemental NDA, or sNDA, must contain all of the information necessary to support the change. In the case of a new indication, that information usually consists of at least one clinical trial, and often more. Like an NDA, FDA determines whether the sNDA is sufficiently complete to permit review before it files the sNDA. FDA then reviews the sNDA. Like an NDA, FDA can either approve the sNDA or issue a complete response letter outlining the deficiencies in the sNDA. 
 Special Protocol Assessments 
 A SPA is a process in which sponsors may request to meet with the FDA to reach agreement on the design and size of certain clinical trials, clinical studies, or animal trials to determine if they adequately address scientific and regulatory requirements. As part of this process, sponsors submit specific questions about protocol design and scientific and regulatory requirements. After the FDA completes the review of a SPA request, the FDA may issue a SPA Letter, including an assessment of the protocol, agreement or non-agreement with the proposed protocol, and answers to the sponsor’s relevant questions. 
 A SPA agreement indicates concurrence by the FDA with the adequacy and acceptability of specific critical elements of overall protocol design (e.g., entry criteria, dose selection, endpoints, and planned analyses). These elements are critical to ensuring that the trial conducted under the protocol has the potential to support a future submitted application’s ability to meet regulatory requirements for approval. Feedback on these issues provides the greatest benefit to sponsors in planning late-phase development strategy. However, a SPA agreement does not indicate FDA concurrence on every protocol detail. Further, the FDA may rescind a SPA if the director of the FDA reviewing division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the trial began. Thus, a SPA is not binding on the FDA if, for example, the Agency identifies a safety concern related to the product or its pharmacological class, if the FDA or the scientific community recognizes a paradigm shift in disease diagnosis or management, if the relevant data or assumptions provided by the sponsor in the SPA submission are found to be false or misstated, or if the sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA. The FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of a SPA agreement and the data and results from the applicable clinical trial. 
 Because a SPA provides for the evaluation of protocols for trials that have not been initiated, the conduct and results of the subsequent trial are not part of the evaluation. Therefore, the existence of an SPA agreement does not guarantee that the FDA will accept an NDA, or that the trial results will be adequate to support approval. Those issues are addressed during the review of a submitted application; however, it is hoped that trial quality will be improved by the SPA process. 
 Post-approval requirements and consideration 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may also require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for the healthcare professionals, and other Elements To Assure Safe Use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. 
 Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. 
 
18 

  Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments 
 Orange Book Listing 
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims covering the applicant’s product or approved methods of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug are then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. 
 Exclusivity 
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (NCE), which is a drug product that contains an active moiety that has never been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. A drug may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for the previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. During this period of exclusivity, FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. 
 
19 

  An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there cannot be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA can be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. 
 Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications 
 Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2), NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on FDA’s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application. 
 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness or published literature is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain pre-clinical or clinical studies of the new product. 
 The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be eligible for three years of marketing exclusivity to the same extent that a Section 505(b)(1) NDA is. 
 Abbreviated new drug applications 
 Generic drugs may enter the market after the approval of an ANDA. The ANDA development process typically does not require new pre-clinical or clinical studies, but it does typically require one or more bioequivalence studies to show that the ANDA drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved brand name reference listed drug. Bioequivalence studies compare the bioavailability of the proposed drug product with that of the approved listed product containing the same active ingredient. Bioavailability is a measure of the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety is absorbed from a drug product and becomes available at the site of action. A demonstration of bioequivalence means that the rate and extent of absorption of the ANDA drug is not significantly different from the rate and extent of absorption of the brand name reference listed drug when administered at the same molar dose under similar experimental conditions. 
 As noted above, generic drug products are generally introduced to the marketplace at the expiration of patent protection and non-patent market exclusivity for the reference listed drug. However, if an ANDA applicant is the first ANDA applicant to submit an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification, that ANDA may be eligible for a period of generic marketing exclusivity on approval. This exclusivity, which under certain circumstances must be shared with other ANDA applicants with Paragraph IV certifications, lasts for 180 days, during which the FDA cannot grant final approval to other ANDA sponsors of an application for a generic equivalent to the same reference drug. Under certain circumstances, eligibility for 180-day exclusivity may be forfeited. 
 Various types of changes to an approved ANDA must be requested in a prior approval supplement. In addition, some changes may only be approved after new bioequivalence studies are conducted or other requirements are satisfied. In addition, the ANDA applicant must demonstrate that manufacturing procedures and operations conform to FDA cGMP requirements. Facilities, procedures, operations, and/or testing of products are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other authorities. In addition, the FDA conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and inspections to determine whether the systems and processes are in compliance with cGMP and other FDA regulations. 
 There are also user fees for ANDA applicants, sponsors, and manufacturers. For fiscal year 2022, the application fees are $225,712 per ANDA application and the facility fees are $195,012 per domestic finished dosage form facility, $210,012 per foreign finished dosage form facility, $42,557 per domestic active pharmaceutical ingredient facility, and $57,557 per foreign active pharmaceutical ingredient facility. In addition, there is a new annual program fee based on the size of the generic drug applicant. These user fees typically increase each fiscal year. 
 
20 

  Other regulatory requirements 
 In addition to regulation by the FDA and certain state regulatory agencies, we are also subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and the marketing of other products. Outside of the United States, our ability to market a product depends upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory agencies. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In any country, however, we will only be permitted to commercialize our products if the appropriate regulatory agency is satisfied that we have presented adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in those countries. The regulatory approval and oversight process in other countries includes all of the risks associated with regulation by the FDA and certain state regulatory agencies as described above. 
 Under the European Union regulatory system, applications for drug approval may be submitted either in a centralized or decentralized manner. Under the centralized procedure, a single application to the European Medicines Agency leads to an approval granted by the European Commission which permits marketing of the product throughout the European Union. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of nationally approved decisions and is used for products that do not comply with requirements for the centralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure, the holders of national marketing authorization in one of the countries within the European Union may submit further applications to other countries within the European Union, who will be requested to recognize the original authorization based on an assessment report provided by the country in which marketing authorization is held. 
 Pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement 
 In both United States and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our products successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our products, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including, in the United States, governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care organizations, private commercial health insurers and PBMs. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic or other studies in order to further demonstrate the value of our products. Even with the availability of such studies, our products may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than alternative products, and third-party payors may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our drug candidates, in whole or in part. 
 Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our business, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “Affordable Care Act”). In fact, there continue to be efforts in Congress to revise the Affordable Care Act and replace it with another law. As a result, there is great uncertainty as to what changes will be made to United States healthcare laws and there can be no assurance how changes to those laws may affect our business. 
 We anticipate that in the United States, Congress, state legislatures, and private sector entities will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost containment measures could include: 
 

• | controls on government-funded reimbursement for drugs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | mandatory rebates or additional charges to manufacturers for their products to be covered on Medicare Part D formularies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | controls on healthcare providers;
--+----------------------------------


• | controls on pricing of drug products, including the possible reference of the pricing of United States drugs to non-United States drug pricing for the same product;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reform of drug importation laws;
--+---------------------------------


• | entering into contractual agreements with payors; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of use of managed-care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We are unable to predict what additional legislation, regulations or policies, if any, relating to the healthcare industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation, regulations or policies would have on our business. Any cost containment measures, including those listed above, or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects. 
 
21 

  Further, the pricing of drug products generally, and particularly the pricing of orphan drugs, has recently received scrutiny from the press, and from members of Congress in both parties. Some members of the medical community and Senator Bernie Sanders have also made statements in the press on the potential pricing of orphan drugs generally and on the pricing of our product specifically. The impact of this scrutiny on us and on the pricing of orphan drugs and other drug products generally cannot be determined with any certainty at this time. 
 Orphan Drug Exclusivity and Pediatric Exclusivity Designation 
 Some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 (ODA), the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. In the United States, Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. An Orphan Drug Designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The grant of an Orphan Drug Designation request does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. Safety and efficacy of a compound must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies. If a product which has been granted Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to an orphan drug exclusivity period, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same disease or condition for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as where an alternative product demonstrates clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the drug. 
 The orphan drug exclusivity contained in the ODA has been the subject of recent scrutiny from the press, from some members of Congress and from some in the medical community, and a recent proposed change to the ODA would limit the availability of the benefits of the act for drugs that treat more than 200,000 individuals in the United States. There can be no assurance that the exclusivity granted in ODA to orphan drugs approved by the FDA will not be modified in the future, and as to how any such change might affect our products, if approved. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the five-year and three-year non-patent and seven-year orphan exclusivities. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly responds to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied. If the FDA determines that information relating to the use of the new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in the population, the clinical study is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request and the reports of FDA-requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection covering the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application relying on the NDA sponsor’s data. 
 The European Orphan Drug Regulation is considered for drugs intended to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or very serious condition afflicting five or fewer per 10,000 people in the EU, including compounds that for serious and chronic conditions would likely not be marketed without incentives due to low market return on the sponsor’s development investment. The medicinal product considered should be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Benefits of being granted Orphan Medicinal Product Designation are significant, including eight years of data exclusivity, two years of marketing exclusivity and a potential one-year extension of both. The EU Community and Member States may not accept or grant for ten years a new marketing authorization or application for another drug for the same therapeutic indication as the orphan drug, although the ten-year period can be reduced to six years if, after the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of the marketing exclusivity. A supplementary protection certificate may extend the protection six months beyond patent expiration if that is later than the orphan drug exclusivity period. To apply for the supplementary protection, a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, must be included in the market application. In Europe all drugs now seeking marketing authorization need to have a PIP agreed with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) before it can be approved, even if it is a drug being developed specifically for a pediatric indication. If a product is developed solely for use in the pediatric population, then a Pediatric Use Marketing Authorization, or PUMA, may provide eight years of data exclusivity and ten years of marketing exclusivity. 
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation 
 Breakthrough therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The criteria for breakthrough therapy designation require preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy. A breakthrough therapy designation conveys all of the fast track program features (see below for more details on fast track designation), as well as more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program. The FDA also has an organizational commitment to involve senior management in such guidance. Actions taken to expedite development may include the following actions, as appropriate:

• | holding meetings with the sponsor and review team throughout the development of the drug;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the non-clinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as possible;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the cross-discipline members of the review team (i.e., clinical, pharmacology-toxicology, chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC), compliance) for coordinated internal interactions and communications with the sponsor through the review division’s Regulatory Health Project Manager; and

Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval 
 FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. 
 Under the fast track program and FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 
 In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by FDA. 
 In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with FDA, FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drug’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Priority Review 
 Under FDA policies, a drug candidate is eligible for priority review, or review within a six to eight-month time frame from the time a complete NDA is submitted, if the drug candidate is intended for the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious or life-threatening condition, demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need, or provides a significant improvement compared to marketed drugs. 
 Disclosure of clinical trial information 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the clinical trial. Competitors may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.

  Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws & the Prescription Drug Marketing Act 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of drug products, other state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and patients, prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. 
 Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. 
 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has issued a final rule that requires manufacturers of approved prescription drugs to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians, physician assistants, certain types of advanced practice nurses and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The information reported each year is made publicly available on a searchable website. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. 
 In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products, to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states and to report certain pricing information, including price increases. Other states prohibit various other marketing-related activities. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. 
 Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the United States Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), a part of the FDCA. In addition, Title II of the Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), has imposed new “track and trace” requirements on the distribution of prescription drug products by manufacturers, distributors, and other entities in the drug supply chain. The DSCSA requires product identifiers (i.e., serialization) on prescription drug products in order to eventually establish an electronic interoperable prescription product to system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States and preempts existing state drug pedigree laws and regulations on this topic. The DSCSA also establishes new requirements for the licensing of wholesale distributors and third-party logistic providers, although FDA regulations addressing wholesale distributors and third party logistics providers have not yet been promulgated. We serialize our product at both the package and homogeneous case level, pass serialization and required transaction information to our customers, and believe that we comply with all such requirements. 
 Government Programs for Marketed Drugs 
 Medicaid, the 340B Drug Pricing Program, and Medicare 
 Federal law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer, as a condition of having its products receive federal reimbursement under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, must pay rebates to state Medicaid programs for all units of its covered outpatient drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program under either a fee-for-service arrangement or through a managed care organization. This federal requirement is effectuated through a Medicaid drug rebate agreement between the manufacturer and the 
 
24 

  Secretary of Health and Human Services. CMS administers the Medicaid drug rebate agreements, which provide, among other things, that the drug manufacturer will pay rebates to each state Medicaid agency on a quarterly basis and report certain price information on a monthly and quarterly basis. The rebates are based on prices reported to CMS by manufacturers for their covered outpatient drugs. For innovator products, that is, drugs that are marketed under approved NDAs, the basic rebate amount is the greater of 23.1% of the average manufacturer price (“AMP”) for the quarter or the difference between such AMP and the best price for that same quarter. The AMP is the weighted average of prices paid to the manufacturer (1) directly by retail community pharmacies and (2) by wholesalers for drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies. The best price is essentially the lowest price available to non-governmental entities. Innovator products are also subject to an additional rebate that is based on the amount, if any, by which the product’s current AMP has increased over the baseline AMP, which is the AMP for the first full quarter after launch, adjusted for inflation. To date, the rebate amount for a drug has been capped at 100% of the AMP; however, effective January 1, 2024, this cap will be eliminated, which means that a manufacturer could pay a rebate amount on a unit of the drug that is greater than the average price the manufacturer receives for the drug. For non-innovator products, generally generic drugs marketed under approved abbreviated new drug applications, the basic rebate amount is 13% of the AMP for the quarter. Non-innovator products are also subject to an additional rebate. The additional rebate is similar to that discussed above for innovator products, except that the baseline AMP quarter is the fifth full quarter after launch (for non- innovator multiple source drugs launched on April 1, 2013 or later) or the third quarter of 2014 (for those launched before April 1, 2013). The terms of participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in additional or lesser rebate liability, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates, if a manufacturer were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information. 
 A manufacturer must also participate in a federal program known as the 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available to pay for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Under this program, the participating manufacturer agrees to charge certain federally funded clinics and safety net hospitals no more than an established discounted price for its covered outpatient drugs. The formula for determining the discounted price is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and the unit rebate amount as calculated under the Medicaid drug rebate program, discussed above. Manufacturers are required to report pricing information to the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”) on a quarterly basis. HRSA has also issued regulations relating to the calculation of the ceiling price as well as imposition of civil monetary penalties for each instance of knowingly and intentionally overcharging a 340B covered entity. 
 Federal law also requires that manufacturers report data on a quarterly basis to CMS regarding the pricing of drugs that are separately reimbursable under Medicare Part B. These are generally drugs, such as injectable products, that are administered “incident to” a physician service and are not generally self-administered. The pricing information submitted by manufacturers is the basis for reimbursement to physicians and suppliers for drugs covered under Medicare Part B. As with the Medicaid drug rebate program, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information. 
 Medicare Part D provides prescription drug benefits for seniors and people with disabilities. Medicare Part D beneficiaries once had a gap in their coverage (between the initial coverage limit and the point at which catastrophic coverage begins) where Medicare did not cover their prescription drug costs, known as the coverage gap. However, beginning in 2019, Medicare Part D beneficiaries pay 25% of brand drug costs after they reach the initial coverage limit—the same percentage they were responsible for before they reached that limit—thereby closing the coverage gap. Most of the cost of closing the coverage gap is being borne by innovator companies and the government through subsidies. Each manufacturer of a drug approved under an NDA is required to enter into a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount agreement and provide a 70% discount on those drugs dispensed to Medicare beneficiaries in the coverage gap, in order for its drugs to be reimbursed by Medicare Part D. 
 Federal Contracting/Pricing Requirements 
 Manufacturers are also required to make their covered drugs, which are generally drugs approved under NDAs, available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) of the General Services Administration. The law also requires manufacturers to offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing for purchases of their covered drugs by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense (“DoD”), the Coast Guard, and the Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service) in order for federal funding to be available for reimbursement or purchase of the manufacturer’s drugs under certain federal programs. FSS pricing to those four federal agencies for covered drugs must be no more than the Federal Ceiling Price (“FCP”), which is at least 24% below the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (“Non-FAMP”) for the prior year. 
 The Non-FAMP is the average price for covered drugs sold to wholesalers or other middlemen, net of any price reductions. 
 
25 

  The accuracy of a manufacturer’s reported Non-FAMPs, FCPs, or FSS contract prices may be audited by the government. Among the remedies available to the government for inaccuracies is recoupment of any overcharges to the four specified federal agencies based on those inaccuracies. If a manufacturer were found to have knowingly reported false prices, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the law provides for civil monetary penalties of $100,000 per incorrect item. 
 Finally, manufacturers are required to disclose in FSS contract proposals all commercial pricing that is equal to or less than the proposed FSS pricing, and subsequent to award of an FSS contract, manufacturers are required to monitor certain commercial price reductions and extend commensurate price reductions to the government, under the terms of the FSS contract Price Reductions Clause. Among the remedies available to the government for any failure to properly disclose commercial pricing and/or to extend FSS contract price reductions is recoupment of any FSS overcharges that may result from such omissions. 
 Tricare Retail Pharmacy Network Program 
 The DoD provides pharmacy benefits to current and retired military service members and their families through the Tricare healthcare program. When a Tricare beneficiary obtains a prescription drug through a retail pharmacy, the DoD reimburses the pharmacy at the retail price for the drug rather than procuring it from the manufacturer at the discounted FCP discussed above. In order for the DoD to realize discounted prices for covered drugs (generally drugs approved under NDAs), federal law requires manufacturers to pay refunds on utilization of their covered drugs sold to Tricare beneficiaries through retail pharmacies in DoD’s Tricare network. These refunds are generally the difference between the Non-FAMP and the FCP and are due on a quarterly basis. Absent an agreement from the manufacturer to provide such refunds, DoD will designate the manufacturer’s products as Tier 3 (non-formulary) and require that beneficiaries obtain prior authorization in order for the products to be dispensed at a Tricare retail network pharmacy. However, refunds are due whether or not the manufacturer has entered into such an agreement. 
Branded Pharmaceutical Fee 
 A branded pharmaceutical fee is imposed on manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs, generally drugs approved under NDAs. In each year between 2011 and 2018, the aggregate fee for all such manufacturers ranged from $2.5 billion to $4.1 billion, and has remained at $2.8 billion in 2019 and subsequent years. This annual fee is apportioned among the participating companies based on each company’s sales of qualifying products to or utilization by certain U.S. government programs during the preceding calendar year. The fee is not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Utilization of generic drugs, generally drugs approved under ANDAs, is not included in a manufacturer’s sales used to calculate its portion of the fee. 
Human Capital Management 
 We are dedicated to making a meaningful impact on the lives of those suffering from rare diseases, and we believe in putting patients first in everything we do. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Catalyst an inclusive, safe, and healthy workplace, with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits, health and welfare programs. Our goal in selecting employees is to retain high quality personnel with substantial prior experience who understand and support our mission as a company to develop and commercialize innovative therapies for people with rare, debilitating, chronic neuromuscular and neurological diseases and who are willing to work hard and in a collaborative manner to further that mission. 
Employee Profile 
 As of March 14, 2022, we had approximately 76 employees, approximately 32 of whom are in our commercial organization, approximately 23 of whom are in our R&D organization, and the rest of whom are in our G&A organization. We also utilize the services of several full-time consultants who work with our commercial organization. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relationship with our employees and consultants is good. 
Compensation and Benefits 
 Our compensation philosophy is to provide pay and benefits that are competitive in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry where we compete for talent. We monitor our compensation programs closely and review them at least annually to provide what we consider to be a very competitive mix of compensation and health, welfare and retirement benefits for all our employees. Our compensation package for all employees includes market-competitive base salaries, annual performance bonuses and stock option grants. Our benefits programs include company sponsored medical, dental and vision health care coverage, life and AD&D insurance, and a 401(k) plan with a matching employer contribution, among others benefits.

  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 Our goal is a diverse and inclusive workforce – not because it is the right thing to do but because we believe that such a workforce is key to our long-term success. Approximately 58% of our employees are female. At the leadership level (employees at manager and above) approximately 64% are female, and two of seven members of our C-suite are female. 
 Communication and Engagement 
 We focus on engagement with our employees as we believe an engaged workforce is key to our success and to the success and wellbeing of our employees. In October 2021, we held an in-person meeting with our sales staff for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This meeting, as with the meetings prior to the pandemic, serve to bring together and energize our staff. We plan to hold further such meetings as the course of the COVID-19 pandemic allows. 
 Health, Wellness and Safety 
 We are committed to the health and safety of our employees. 
 In March 2020, in light of worsening conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a number of safety related initiatives among our employees, including a travel ban and a work from home policy for all employees. This included our customer-facing employees, who began working remotely and utilizing telephone and web-based technologies to provide support to patients and their healthcare providers. At present, our operations have returned to mostly being in-person, with some contact with doctors by our commercial sales force still being done remotely. Notwithstanding, the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, including the delta and omicron variants, could affect the health and availability of our workforce, and we may return to a work from home policy if it is in the best interests of the health and welfare of our employees.
