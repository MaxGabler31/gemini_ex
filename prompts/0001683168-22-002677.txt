Going Concern
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company currently has no operations and as of December 31, 2021 had a stockholders deficit of $362,776. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Our Business
 
Currently, we have no active operations.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2022, the Company had no employees.
 
Insurance
 
We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party to any action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.
Government Regulation
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business. We do not need to receive any government approvals necessary to conduct our business; however, we will have to comply with all applicable export and import regulations.

Our principal executive office is located at Room 1105, 11/F, Hip Kwan Commercial Building, No. 38 Pitt Street, Yau Ma Tei, Kowloon, Hong Kong. Our telephone number is +852 29803733.
