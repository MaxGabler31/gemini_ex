ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on September 2, 2014. Our original business plan was to provide internet-based project management software for small business. On January 6, 2016, our majority stockholder entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell 75.61% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock for $255,000 in cash to Mr. Lei Wang, resulting in a change in control of our company. Following the change of control, we are now seeking to acquire, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction with one or more operating businesses or assets that we have not yet identified.
