Mission
Our mission is to transform how people learn. We are enabling access to high quality, personalized, live learning in any subject, anywhere, at any time. 
Business Overview
We operate a platform for live online learning. Our mission is to transform the way people learn. Our purpose-built proprietary platform leverages technology, including artificial intelligence (“AI”), to connect students, users, parents, guardians, and purchasers (“Learner(s)”) of all ages to tutors, instructors, subject matter experts, educators, and other professionals (“Expert(s)”), delivering superior value on both sides of the network. Our comprehensive learning destination provides learning experiences across numerous subjects and multiple formats, including one-on-one instruction, small group classes, large format group classes, and adaptive self-study. Our flagship business, Varsity Tutors LLC (“Varsity Tutors”), is one of the nation’s largest platforms for live online tutoring and classes. Our platform offers Experts the opportunity to generate income from the convenience of home, while also increasing access for Learners by removing barriers to high-quality live online learning. Our offerings include Varsity Tutors for Schools, a product suite that leverages our platform capabilities to offer our online learning solutions directly to education systems, and StarCourses, our free celebrity-led, live large group classes.
Our platform delivers value to both Learners, who are our customers, and Experts. We have built a diversified business across multiple audiences, including: K-8, High School, College, Graduate School, Professional and Adult. Learners and Experts come to us for convenience, value, and a superior learning experience. We believe we have built a scalable platform that allows us to drive growth, satisfaction for Learners, and retention across audiences and subjects, as well as allowing Experts to generate income from the convenience of home.
Every day millions of students and professionals in our country struggle to get the help they need to master the subjects and skills they are attempting to learn. Whether it is seeking help understanding algebra, chemistry, learning to code, studying for a nursing exam, or attempting to comprehend thousands of other topics, Learners are increasingly looking for help to supplement their in-classroom education or on-the-job training. We created Nerdy to help these Learners get the help they need from the Experts who are most qualified to provide the assistance.
The breadth of our platform offering in terms of both subject and learning format, combined with our ability to build trust, own the customer relationship, and make good on our customer promises has allowed us to generate high customer satisfaction. This relationship with our customers and a relentless focus on delivering an exceptional customer experience enables longer-term and higher lifetime value relationships with Learners.
We attract Experts to our platform who are highly qualified to instruct across a variety of audiences and subjects. We offer Experts the opportunity to generate income from the convenience of home with less hassle, deliver a superior online instruction experience, and empower them to help people learn. Our technology platform matches Learners to the Experts who are qualified to provide the unique assistance our Learners need, which results in long-term highly-satisfied customer relationships that generate sustained income for the Experts.
Finding the exact right Expert to meet the specific and unique needs of a Learner is a critical driver of having a successful learning experience and has a profound impact on Learner satisfaction. Our technology platform identifies and curates the top Experts in every subject, which enables us to match Learners to the Experts who are ideally qualified to help them learn. The result is an exceptional experience for Learners. We use AI to select the ideal Expert for a given Learner’s needs, taking into account approximately 100 variables, including Learner and Expert attributes, diagnostic assessments, and data from past learning experiences. We believe quality matching is a key differentiator for Nerdy, something that legacy offline models and online directories struggle to do well.
Nerdy’s multi-format online learning destination improves access and lowers cost barriers to high-quality, live learning and other additive learning resources. Our product suite includes paid one-on-one instruction and small group class products, in addition to free live large-format online classes that are interactive and can accommodate 500 to 50,000+ Learners, including classes taught by celebrity scientists, astronauts, and wildlife experts. Additionally, Nerdy’s library of hundreds of thousands of resources, including online adaptive diagnostic tests and practice problems, are offered completely free for Learners. Our free content helps attract new users to our platform and complements our paid product offerings by increasing retention of our existing users.
Our platform and multiple learning formats allow us to deliver value in more ways and establish lasting relationships between Learners and Experts. This generates powerful network effects in our business: high customer satisfaction attracts more Learners to our platform, which in turn attracts more Experts as well. These dynamics have allowed us to deliver durable growth and healthy unit economics.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, Active Learners increased by 46% from approximately 87 thousand in 2020 to approximately 127 thousand in 2021, while paid online sessions increased by 73% in the same time frame from 1,113 thousand to 1,921 thousand sessions. “Active Learners” is defined as the unique number of Learners attending a paid online one-on-one instruction, a paid online class, or a paid group tutoring session in a given period.
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $36,696 thousand from $103,968 thousand to $140,664, or 35%, compared to 2020.

Market Network Effects
Our platform benefits from several positive and reinforcing network effects. As we leverage technology to improve the match quality between Experts and Learners, we are able to improve the experience on both sides of our network. Our AI leverages over 100 million usable data points to personalize the experience for each Learner and Expert. The result is a high-quality learning experience across over 3,000 subjects. The higher the quality of Experts on our platform, the more Learners are attracted to our platform.
More Learners on our platform leads to more earning opportunities for Experts and more high quality and rewarding interactions. Our algorithms allocate more work to the best Experts, which helped lead to increased engagement among Learners and Experts with paid sessions per Expert being up 19% in 2021 compared to 2020. Additionally, access to high-quality Experts has enabled us to add more subjects and more learning formats to our platform. We have built a comprehensive online learning destination that provides Learners of all ages with multiple ways to learn beyond one-on-one instruction. This has resulted in 46% Active Learner growth in 2021 compared to 2020.
Industry Background and Key Trends
There are several favorable trends in the learning market that make our platform and proposition appealing on both sides of the network and we believe that our business will disproportionately win as these category dynamics shift.
•Changing Workforce Dynamics: The advent of technology has dramatically changed how people view work, and platforms that enable interactions directly between providers and consumers are disrupting traditional, antiquated models. The shifting mindset of today’s workforce towards seeking flexibility, freedom, and personal fulfillment has enabled transformation of several categories in recent years. We believe these dynamics will also fundamentally change the way people learn. We have a significant opportunity to leverage technology to connect highly qualified Experts directly to Learners of all ages and to enable high quality live learning at scale.
•Secular Digitization of Learning: While the learning industry has historically been a laggard for online adoption, we believe it is at an inflection point and is now undergoing rapid digital transformation. Technology has lowered the barriers for individuals to access learning opportunities and connect with Experts on a global scale and is removing the inefficiencies of in-person interactions, increasing affordability, extending geographic access, and providing flexibility and convenience through on-demand online models. AI is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of AI based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. We leverage both internally developed and externally licensed capabilities related to AI, which allows large data sets to be leveraged and understood in a way that can generate substantial insights that drive the personalization of the learning experience. Increased digital connectivity between Learners, Experts, and other key stakeholders is improving communication and accountability to provide increased transparency into Learner achievement. These trends have only accelerated as the COVID-19 pandemic has provided an enormous catalyst, with global digital learning projected to grow at a 30% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) over the next seven years, according to GSV Ventures.
•Consumerization of Learning: The transition in modern Learners’ preferences towards finding, curating, and managing their own learning is reshaping the learning markets and contributing to the digitization of learning. These consumers experience the same level of agency and modern technology-enabled approach they experience in other categories that have digitized. As a result of this shift in consumer behavior, learning providers have emerged that focus on direct-to-consumer models making learning resources, including live learning, available broadly and on-demand. By providing numerous learning formats to help Learners access top Experts across a multitude of formats, including adaptive self-study tools, our platform empowers both Learners and Experts to have more agency, optimize interactions, and enhance their learning and instructing experience.
•Pandemic’s Impact on Learning Proficiency: The abrupt shelter-in-place directives led to prolonged closures in 2021 and 2020 of K-12 schools and colleges and universities throughout the United States (the “U.S.”). These closures have been a significant driver of learning loss in the last two years for students across the U.S. A recent McKinsey study suggests students are four months behind in mathematics and three months behind in reading with students where they otherwise would have been prior to the pandemic. The McKinsey report also notes the federal government has committed more than $200 billion to K-12 education through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (the “CRRSAA”), and the American Rescue Plan (the “ARP”), which we believe will help to accelerate the adoption of third-party supplemental learning solutions by school districts, opening the door for the start of durable, long-term relationships. In the third quarter of 2021, we launched our institutional strategy with the introduction of Varsity Tutors for Schools, a new product suite that leverages the technology infrastructure and product capabilities originally developed for our consumer business, providing a single comprehensive Learning Platform as a Service platform that allows institutions to roster entire student bases and deploy solutions for different segments of students. The offerings are highly customizable and can be deployed by school administrators across large student populations in a scalable manner to meet the needs of their specific student populations. We expect Varsity Tutors for Schools will also be a strong partner for universities and other higher-education institutions as they continue to evolve their offerings to attract and support their diversified student populations. We view partnering with education institutions, including K-12 school districts and universities, as a durable, long-term opportunity to help improve the way supplemental learning is administered.
•Shift to Lifelong and Skills-Based Learning: Our economy has evolved to a knowledge-based economy, with employers competing for workers with the most job-appropriate and up-to-date skill sets. Additionally, technological advancements and their resulting transformational changes across industries are impacting skill requirements in today’s workplace. According to the Future of Jobs Report 2020 published by the World Economic Forum, companies hope to internally redeploy 50% of employees displaced by technological automation and augmentation. As a result, today’s workforce needs to constantly learn new concepts and skills to keep pace with fast-changing job requirements 
without the heavy penalty of having to temporarily exit the workforce. The Future of Jobs Report 2020 believes that companies looking to ensure success of these redeployment strategies will, among other things, need to direct their employees to effective resources and meaningful curricula. Our learning platform is ideally positioned to provide today’s professionals the flexibility to continue their learning journey at their convenience while acquiring the requisite skills across a vast range of subjects and multiple learning modalities, and also provide their employers with a return on their investment.
Our Market Opportunity
A recent industry report estimates that the global market for supplemental education in 2020 was estimated to be $1.3 trillion, excluding government-funded education. GSV Ventures estimates that online penetration of this market is expected to grow 5 fold over the next seven years, which represents a CAGR of 30%, providing significant macroeconomic tailwinds for our business. The market for direct-to-consumer learning is large, fragmented, and ripe for disruption. We believe that advances in technology - specifically the ability to deliver high quality, personalized instruction at an affordable price with more convenience - have created a tremendous opportunity to transform the way learning is delivered. Additionally, with the COVID-19-induced disruptions education institutions have endured in recent years, the receptivity to utilizing technology-enabled, innovative solutions has never been greater. We believe we are at the beginning of a long-term and durable shift in the way supplemental learning will be delivered - a shift that we believe will persist for years to come. We estimate our U.S. direct-to-consumer learning total addressable market was approximately $57 billion in 2020 and will grow to approximately $75 billion by 2025. We view our market opportunity across a handful of major categories:
•Academic Tutoring: Academic Tutoring encompasses private tutoring services availed by students from third-party training providers to supplement learning through academic education, including subjects such as STEM, arts, and foreign languages. The Academic Tutoring market in the U.S. as of 2020 is estimated to be $18.9 billion and is projected to reach $27.3 billion by 2025, according to Technavio’s U.S. Private Tutoring Market Report.
•Professional Certifications, Training, & Skills: Professional Certifications, Training, & Skills encompasses test preparation services tools, study materials, and live instruction delivered through online and blended learning models, serving professionals seeking new training, upskilling, or certifications. The size of this market in the US is estimated to be $11.3 billion in 2020 and is projected to be $14.3 billion by 2024, according to Technavio’s US Test Preparation Market Report.
•Enrichment: Enrichment encompasses instruction in non-academic segments such as enrichment, visual arts, and technology. The size of this market in the U.S. is estimated to be $5.5 billion in 2020 and is projected to grow to $6.2 billion by 2025, according to IBISWorld research from June 2020.
•Test Preparation: Test Preparation encompasses tools, study materials, and live instruction delivered through online and blended learning models, serving students in their preparation for elementary, high school, undergraduate, and graduate school exams. The Test Preparation market size in the U.S. as of 2020 is estimated to be $21.1 billion and is projected to reach $27.1 billion by 2024, according to Technavio’s U.S. Test Preparation Market Report.
In addition to the direct-to-consumer market, we also target relationships with education institutions. These institutions receive a large variety of funding sources. One such large increase for K-12 schools districts was the federal government committing more than $200 billion to K-12 education through the CARES Act, the CRRSAA, and the ARP. We believe Varsity Tutors for Schools, our new product suite that leverages our platform capabilities to offer our online learning solutions directly to education systems, is uniquely positioned to support school districts. We believe recent government funding allows us to enter the institutional market and establish partnerships with schools more efficiently than would have otherwise been the case, and is just the beginning of a durable, long-term trend that is being recognized by educators, administrators, and policy makers alike, that will lead to greater structural changes within supplemental education and how instruction is delivered to Learners.
Our Solution - A Comprehensive Online Learning Destination
To address the large market opportunity, we built Nerdy and our flagship business, Varsity Tutors, to be a leading, multi-format, online learning destination. We incorporate one-on-one instruction, live small and large group classes, and adaptive self-study tools to address the needs of Learners of all ages across more than 3,000 subjects.
Our platform-oriented approach to growth allows us to leverage the shared capabilities we have developed - that serve as building blocks that can be modified for different markets and audiences - and allows us to efficiently enter new markets and modify our product offerings to the unique aspects of each group of Learners. In doing so, we’re able to build solutions that 
improve quality, decrease cost, improve convenience, and meet the needs of Learners, enabling access to high quality live learning that would otherwise not exist in service of helping people learn.
One-on-One Instruction
Through our one-on-one instruction format, Learners receive a completely personalized learning experience. Our award-winning and purpose-built Live Learning Platform enables collaboration and interaction including features such as two-way video, collaborative workspace, and session recording that not only seeks to replicate the best aspects of the in-person learning experience online, but actually delivers an enhanced experience that was simply not possible offline. Learners use our platform to access highly qualified Experts, on a flexible schedule, from wherever they want.
We also built Instant Tutoring, an on-demand solution that provides Learners immediate access to live online one-on-one instruction 24 hours a day and 7 days a week with no prior appointment necessary. One-on-one instruction is typically purchased in packages of hours. Students can buy as little as one hour and use as little as 15 minutes at a time; however, Learners typically purchase a package of hours, which can be used in any subject, with a variety of Experts, at any time. 
Live Group Classes
We offer a comprehensive, multi-format, learning experience to meet our Learners’ needs beyond one-on-one instruction. Our interactive, live, online classes allow Learners of all ages to connect in a collaborative and social environment and provide a lower cost solution than one-on-one instruction.
•Small Group Classes: Our Small Group Class format is re-inventing the in-person classroom online, allowing Learners to join up to 20 other peers for live lessons in a virtual classroom across a range of topics, including academic, enrichment, foreign languages, test prep, and professional certification. By using adaptive assessments to determine the proficiency of each Learner before placement, the class experience is more tailored to the individualized needs of participants. Classes are taught by highly qualified Experts with deep instructional and teaching experience. Through Q&A sessions, student projects, and individualized attention, the Experts are able to intimately engage with each Learner while providing a different, more social, less intensive, and lower cost solution than one-on-one instruction.
•Large Group Classes: Through our Large Group Class format, we can facilitate high quality scaled live learning experiences for 500 to over 50,000 students at any given time. Subjects offered range from academic, to test prep, to enrichment, all offered completely free of charge. This is both a “top of funnel” strategy that builds trust and awareness and that drives engagement among existing Learners. It also allows us to improve educational accessibility in a scalable way. Large Group Classes are often taught by celebrity Experts, who bring notoriety and additional excitement to the live class format.
Adaptive Self-Study
Our adaptive self-study solutions drive engagement with both new and existing Learners on the platform. Tools and resources, such as adaptive assessments, practice problems, and videos to help Learners progress at a pace that works for them, are offered completely free of charge. Our collection of over 200 thousand standards-aligned practice problems, quizzes, flashcards, and diagnostic assessments are delivered on our platform and via our mobile apps at no cost, enabling millions of Learners to access quality asynchronous tools to improve learning outcomes. Using the latest advances in learning science and AI, our adaptive assessments can measure a Learner’s proficiency in a given subject in as little as 20 minutes.
Learning Platform as a Service
Our Learning Platform as a Service offers a customizable set of solutions allowing learning to be “always on” and available for Learners. By offering a comprehensive suite of learning solutions, institutions can add services and product offerings over time as needs evolve, allowing Nerdy to be a long-term partner to institutions as they seek recurring and durable relationships. 
Our Learning Platform as a Service offering leverages the technology infrastructure and product capabilities originally developed for our consumer business, providing a single comprehensive software platform that allows institutions to roster entire student bases and deploy solutions for different segments of students. Today, this solution includes live instruction (1:1 up to 1:5 live tutoring and small group classes) and adaptive diagnostic assessment and measurement of progress (mapped to state standards). Importantly, by using adaptive diagnostic assessments to determine the subject proficiency of each Learner, our platform based approach enables students of similar subject level mastery to receive personalized instruction in a small group setting. In the future, our Learning Platform as a Service may include enrichment programming, chat-based academic support, solutions for students with Learning Differences, SaaS products, and other educational tools. The offerings are highly customizable and can be deployed across large populations in a scalable manner to meet the needs of specific populations.
Our Competitive Strengths
Innovative, highly scalable technology platform purpose-built for online learning.
We have built our proprietary technology platform from the ground up with the purpose of transforming how people learn. We leverage technology, through AI, process automation and other technology, to scale high quality, live instruction, and our platform is designed to optimize online Learner-Expert interactions through tech-enabled features. Our platform is built to scale quickly to accommodate high volumes, and the rapid introduction of new learning formats and subjects. In 2021, our platform hosted 1,921 thousand paid online sessions serving approximately 127 thousand Active Learners, representing 73% and 46% year-over-year growth, respectively. Our large classes format served approximately 200 thousand Active Learners in 2021. We believe our highly scalable platform provides us with opportunities to continue to grow with relatively low capital expenditure requirements, where we build a capability or product one time, and leverage it many times across different markets and audiences.
We provide an engaging and enjoyable learning experience for both our Learners and the Experts. The engagement of Experts on the platform is growing, demonstrated by the increase in paid sessions per active Expert in 2021 of 19% compared to 2020. Our high-quality free large class format drives incremental traffic, brand awareness, and engagement on our platform. As a result of our commitment to quality, we have become a trusted online learning destination with Learners believing Varsity Tutors offers high quality instruction and is a brand they can trust.
Strong unit economics
We generate revenue from our Learner’s consumption of paid online sessions across both one-on-one instruction and group classes. In 2021, we generated $1.1 thousand per Active Learner. As a result, our customers are profitable on their first package purchase, unlike many other two-sided platform business models that depend on substantial retention before an individual customer is profitable. Additional formats and our adaptive self-study capability provide the opportunity to consume more free and paid resources through our platform, which has proven to further extend the lifetime value of our Learners.
Superior learning experience powered by a rich dataset
As a result of our online direct-to-consumer model, we are able to instrument and capture a rich dataset that we utilize to enhance the learning experience throughout the customer journey, which also creates a data-driven competitive advantage that would be hard for competitors to replicate. We leverage technology, through AI and process automation, to rigorously identify and vet highly qualified Experts to ensure high quality instruction at scale is consistently delivered to Learners. As one example, our AI powered proprietary matching algorithm analyzes approximately 100 attributes per Learner and Expert to identify the Learner-to-Expert matches with the highest projected probability of a successful interaction. Our data asset grows more valuable as the platform scales, allowing us to better leverage the growing dataset of learning interactions to better personalize the Learner experience. We are leveraging software and AI to scale personalized learning in a way that we believe is unparalleled and nearly impossible to replicate via an antiquated in-person model.
Founder-led, seasoned management team
We are a company of thinkers, builders, and innovators with a passion for learning. Our management team brings extensive technology, consumer brand, e-commerce, and institutional sales experience, and together with our founder, are deeply passionate about transforming how people learn through technology. We embrace diversity of experience, thought, and skill sets to ensure our team has complementary strengths to succeed in a rapidly evolving industry.
Our Growth Strategy
We have multiple growth vectors that will enable us to further scale our platform by attracting and retaining more Learners and Experts through more deep and meaningful relationships.
As a leading provider of live, online learning and one of the largest platforms for live, online learning in the U.S., we attract and help Learners across multiple audience segments and subjects. We are continually investing in broadening our existing catalog of over 3,000 subjects for audiences across the learning lifecycle, including live instruction solutions, as well as proprietary content used for adaptive self-study. We consistently invest in improving our capabilities, technology architecture, and developing new solutions that can be leveraged across new markets and audiences. Two such recent examples include expanding our subject coverage to include one-on-one, small group, and adaptive assessment for Professionals and separately, students with Learning Differences. There is also considerable and relatively untapped opportunity to extend our platform to reach audiences beyond the U.S. We believe that as our range of subjects offered and audiences served through the platform grows across learning categories, our market presence and brand recognition will expand, driving more Learners and Experts to our platform.
Direct-to-Consumer Audience
Our comprehensive learning destination provides learning experiences across numerous subjects and multiple formats, including one-on-one instruction, small group classes, large format group classes, and adaptive self-study. We are focused on further penetrating our core audiences and continuing to improve the product and customer experience in order to further expand our appeal among our direct-to-consumer audience. We are constantly exploring new methods of learning that will allow us to broaden our appeal to more Learners. We continue to improve the breadth of our class products, including small group classes; make the class experience more immersive and interactive; add selection; optimize pricing; and grow our live class offerings as we increase our penetration in this large and growing market. We have seen strong demand and increasing engagement as we continue to evolve our services and products to better serve our multiple direct-to-consumer audiences.
Institutional Audience
The education system in the U.S. is under tremendous stress, creating an environment with immense opportunity for transformation. While COVID-19 accelerated and amplified some of the acute challenges that existed before the pandemic, adding incremental headwinds in the process, it also created an environment where new solutions to these challenges are not only welcome, but actively being pursued. And with recent advancements in technology, like the learning solutions Nerdy offers, transforming the way people learn has never been more possible.
We believe we are on the brink of what we call “the Great Unbundling of Education,” as school administrators and educators are beginning to rethink how they can deliver the best outcomes for students, looking for new solutions beyond the traditional approach, which historically solved learning demands only with internal and in-person resources. Educators and students now have the opportunity to embrace not only the wealth of digital content options available, but also the increasingly flexible and personalized learning experiences that drive student outcomes.
Schools are experimenting with delivering education during non-traditional hours, such as after school, on the weekends, and during the summer. Schools and universities across the country are also beginning to redesign their physical spaces to foster more interaction and small group work, using technology as an enabler. School leaders are more open than ever before to using online solutions, and are recognizing the value third-party platforms can bring to complement existing classroom instruction, including in scaling evidence-based, high-dosage tutoring. We call this the era of “Unlimited Learning” and view this as the beginning of a durable, long-term category trend - a trend that is being recognized by educators, administrators, and policy makers alike.
In August 2021, we launched our institutional business, Varsity Tutors for Schools, which leverages and builds on our existing platform capabilities to offer education institutions, including school districts, the ability to deploy our solutions across large groups of students. Our Learning Platform as a Service offering leverages the technology infrastructure and product capabilities originally developed for our consumer business, providing a single comprehensive software platform that allows institutions to roster entire student bases and deploy solutions for different segments of students. The offerings are highly customizable and can be deployed across large populations in a scalable manner to meet the needs of specific populations. With the strategic investments we are making to adapt our platform for institutions and school districts, we are well-positioned to be the unlimited learning solution of choice. Our unique and scalable platform leverages millions of data points to deliver live, personalized learning, offering administrators and school officials a critical solution as they lead the next generation of Learners.
Importantly, we believe the capabilities we are building represent only the beginning of our institutional go-to-market strategy, as our Learning Platform as a Service can easily be adapted and leveraged to serve new audiences beyond schools, such as universities, businesses, and other organizations, driving revenue growth and scale for years to come.
Product Innovation and Adaptation Supporting Changing Needs of our Audiences
We build new products and technology capabilities that will enable us to better meet Learner and Expert needs in the future, support innovation, and help drive continued growth while further strengthening our competitive moat. As we gain further scale, our ability to leverage data to infuse more personalization throughout the experience compounds. This leads to improved retention, monetization, and organically driven growth of new Learners and Experts using the platform. It also allows us to more effectively enter new markets and serve new audiences. We continue to evolve and enhance our product experience to build relevance and find solutions to unmet needs across all of our audiences, which opens up new avenues for new growth and lifetime value expansion, and otherwise accelerates our product roadmap.
Targeted acquisitions
Our objective is to leverage our leadership position, deep experience in the sector, and the scale of our platform to opportunistically acquire businesses that unlock additional technology capabilities and provide our Learners with transformative learning technologies that drive continuous improvements across our platform and the user experience.
Our Technology Platform
Technology is at the core of everything we do. Our direct-to-consumer and institutional models are driven by a scalable technology infrastructure that is engineered for learning. We consistently invest in improving our capabilities and technology architecture, as well as in developing new solutions that can be leveraged across new markets and audiences. Our platform is supported by a team of highly experienced and talented developers. Importantly, the investments we make to support a learning solution for one audience can be scaled to apply to new audiences, resulting in returns that are multiples of our initial investment. At our core, we are a technology business and technology investments persist throughout all aspects of the Learner and Expert journey. There are specific groupings of core competencies, or layers, highlighted below, that we believe to be particularly differentiated and powerful. We collectively call them AI for HI™, short for Artificial Intelligence for Human Interaction. The four layers collectively form our operating system that is engineered for learning.
The core layers that form the foundation of our platform are:
•Data Lake: We have built a rich database of learning interactions, capturing years of critical Learner and Expert data that we use to optimize learning on our platform. We have accumulated millions of hours of recorded live instruction, instrumented every interaction, captured a multitude of individualized attributes for Learners and Experts, and have built an adaptive self-study platform that records every practice problem and answer. We leverage technology and software to take our vast dataset to build personalized learning pathways and to enhance the learning experience. As the platform grows, the dataset and our cumulative intelligence grows. This enables even more personalization and unlocks powerful network effects that serve as a competitive advantage that is difficult for others to replicate.
•Curation Layer: The curation layer of the platform utilizes our database of past learning interactions, built over several years through over 100,000 hours of recorded video interviews, to identify critical traits, knowledge, and experience in Experts that correlate to better learning outcomes, which allows us to be highly selective and source the best Experts.
•Matching Layer: Our AI-powered Learner-Expert matching engine analyzes approximately 100 high dimensional features per Learner and Expert to identify the Learner-to-Expert combination with the highest projected probability of a successful interaction. Since 2012 our platform has identified over 800 thousand successful Learner-to-Expert matches based on over 100 million usable data points generated from Learner and Expert attributes, past matching, learning interactions, website and marketing event interactions, and self-study interactions.
•Adaptive Learning Layer: Our platform delivers personalized learning at scale. The system adapts after every learning interaction, which matures and compounds its intelligence to deliver increasingly better guidance to the Learner. Model-derived insights using our rich database of past interactions and Learner attributes continuously adapt the sequencing of the content and learning after every learning interaction, which personalizes the learning path to mastery.
•Interaction Layers: We have designed our platform to optimize the Learner-Expert interaction through two-way video, collaborative workspaces purpose-built for learning, a companion app to enhance the interactivity of sessions in real-time, reference tools, proprietary and third-party content integrations, and additional subject-specific tools. These features enable effective on-demand, integrated, and personalized live learning interaction that increases engagement and Learner satisfaction. Our interactive learning platform serves multiple learning formats meeting the individual preferences of each Learner and empowering them to acquire knowledge in any chosen subject.
Seasonality
For information about the seasonality of our business, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this report.
Competition
Although we have built a scaled and differentiated platform for live learning, we compete with a variety of competitors both online and offline. We believe that the vast majority of our competition is from offline competitors. Within this market, there exist thousands of companies and hundreds of thousands of individuals that provide supplemental instruction and learning services. These span academics, test preparation, professional training and skills, adult learning, enrichment, and other categories. We believe that offline solutions are inferior to the online solution we have developed. Specifically, we believe that our platform is more efficient, convenient, effective, and affordable than most offline solutions. We believe this value proposition is a big factor in driving consumer adoption of online solutions like ours.
The offline market for live learning, both one-on-one instruction and small group classes, is large and fragmented. We compete for time and attention with many small and local businesses, small proprietorships, and larger national companies including franchises. While we believe our online technology driven solution offers significant benefits when compared to these offline options, we compete with them to attract Learners and Experts to our platform.
While we believe we are one of the few companies that offers a comprehensive destination for live learning online, we do compete with other direct-to-consumer and institutional solutions. Consumers have a variety of choices in terms of competitive options across our more than 3,000 subjects offered on the platform. Some of these competitors are well capitalized. We compete against a variety of tutor and class marketplaces and directories and also against companies that offer asynchronous and self-study products. We believe that consumer awareness is one of the primary barriers to the adoption of our online solution. While we have scaled to hundreds of thousands of users, many people in the U.S. and institutions are not aware of the online solutions we offer. Many still believe they need to drive to a brick-and-mortar location often during rush hour traffic to find supplemental learning assistance. We have invested millions of dollars to drive consumer awareness and believe that we will continue to raise awareness of the value and availability of our platform.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and continues to cause global economic disruption and uncertainty, including in our business. We are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and developments related thereto and are taking necessary actions to ensure our ability to safeguard the health of our employees, maintain our operations to serve Learners and institutions and Experts, and preserve financial liquidity to navigate the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional discussion regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses and financial results, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this report. Also, refer to “Human Capital - COVID-19 Response” within this section for information regarding actions we have taken on behalf of our employees.
Reverse Recapitalization
On September 20, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), TPG Pace Tech Opportunities Corp., an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands (“TPG Pace”), and Live Learning Technologies LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (along with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, “Nerdy LLC”), consummated a business combination (the “Closing”), pursuant to the business combination agreement, dated as of January 28, 2021 (as amended, the “Business Combination Agreement”). Nerdy LLC is a holding company that is the sole owner of several operating companies, including its flagship business Varsity Tutors. Immediately prior to the Closing, TPG Pace became a Delaware corporation and was renamed Nerdy Inc. This transaction is referred to herein as the “Reverse Recapitalization.” As a result of the Reverse Recapitalization, Nerdy LLC is consolidated with and into Nerdy Inc.
The Reverse Recapitalization was accomplished through an umbrella partnership corporation (“Up-C”) structure, which is often used by partnerships and limited liability companies (operating as partnerships) undertaking an initial public offering. The Up-C structure allowed legacy Nerdy LLC equity holders (the “Legacy Nerdy Holders”) to retain their equity ownership in Nerdy LLC, an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and provides potential future tax benefits for Nerdy Inc. when the Legacy Nerdy Holders ultimately redeem their pass-through interests for shares of Class A common stock in Nerdy Inc. as a result of a tax receivable agreement (the “Tax Receivable Agreement”). Under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement, 85% of these potential future tax benefits realized by Nerdy Inc. as a result of such redemptions will be paid to certain Legacy Nerdy Holders.
The following diagram illustrates the ownership structure of Nerdy Inc. and Nerdy LLC immediately following the Reverse Recapitalization. The equity interests shown in the diagram include 8,000 thousand shares or units of (i) Class A common stock in Nerdy Inc. or (ii) equity units in Nerdy LLC (and a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock in Nerdy Inc.), as applicable, that comprise the earnouts (see Note 1 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding earnouts and their potential forfeiture).
Human Capital
We are a remote-first company, which means that working remotely is the primary option for our employees. Much like online learning affords Learners the ability to find the best Expert for their needs irrespective of location, we believe a remote-first orientation enables us to access a significantly larger talent pool from which to hire, which can serve as a long-term competitive advantage. As of February 14, 2022, we had approximately one thousand full and part-time employees, none of whom are covered under a collective bargaining agreement.
Talent Acquisition, Development, Engagement, and Retention
We believe that our employees are our greatest asset and place a premium on the importance of their retention, growth, and development. We offer competitive compensation, including salary and equity, and benefits packages to meet the needs of employees in each region in which we operate. All employees are offered training and development opportunities, including unlimited free classes and 52 hours of free tutoring on our Live Learning Platform (for which they provide feedback on their experience with the platform, which helps us improve the platform).
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We have a diverse talent pipeline that allows us to model our leadership principles, foster innovation, build high performing teams, and deliver results. We firmly believe that a diverse workforce enables stronger company performance, enhances culture, and better positions us to serve the varied needs of our customers. We aspire to and promote a welcoming, inclusive culture that values all people - regardless of sex, gender, race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender expression, or experiences - through recruiting outreach, internal connection, and employee-led affinity groups. We are committed to being an organization that is as diverse as the audiences we serve, and that commitment is a part of every hire we make. As of February 14, 2022, approximately 68% of our employees were women and approximately 31% of employees were racially and ethnically diverse.
COVID-19 Response
The COVID-19 pandemic created many challenges for our employees that required us to increase the support we provide to employees. We became a remote-first company, which means that working remotely became the primary option for our 
employees. We provided technology and equipment for our employees to set up workspaces at home. We offered free enrollment in our School@Home program (in exchange for feedback on the program). We increased employee communications and outreach to help create a stronger feeling of team connection in a new virtual world, and established modest per-manager budgets for team-building activities each month.
Regulatory and Administrative Investigations, Audits, and Inquiries
We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning the classification and compensation of Experts, data security, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, business practices, and other matters. Results of investigations, audits, inquiries, and related governmental action are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an investigation, audit, or inquiry having a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly in the event that an investigation, audit, or inquiry results in a lawsuit or unfavorable regulatory enforcement or other action. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us in light of the costs associated with cooperating with, or defending against, such matters, reputational risks, and the diversion of management resources and other factors. For additional regarding the impact of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries on our business and financial results, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
Government Regulation
There are a variety of regulations that apply to how we operate our business, including, for example, regulations related to marketing efforts (such as the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (“TCPA”), Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) guidelines related to communications with consumers, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), among others); regulations related to data privacy of consumers (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)) and how we process such information (such as the CCPA and other similar legislation that is or may be enacted (including the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020 (“CPRA”)), as well as data security and data breaches; regulations related to background checks as regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) and similar state laws and new hire reporting (for employees and independent contractors depending on the state) and other federal, state, and local laws of general applicability to employers, direct-to-consumer companies, and companies in general (these laws, regulations, and standards govern issues such as worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, personal injury, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, consumer protection and warnings, marketing, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application and website accessibility, money transmittal, and background checks).
There have been statutory changes and resulting ballot initiatives regarding independent contractor status that demonstrate certain sentiment among certain legislatures and the public (both favorable and unfavorable). There are also ongoing proposals as it relates to the classification of independent contractors in various states and cities, and there is potential for federal legislation regarding test(s) to determine whether independent contractors are properly classified by their putative employers. It is not possible to predict whether or when such legislative or judicial changes could or would be adopted or implemented, and there are certain proposals that, if adopted, could harm our business through a decrease in the number of Experts available through our platform or through a change to our unit level economics (in the event Experts are deemed to be employees). We may also run the risk of retroactive applications of new laws to our business model that could result in liability or losses.
We are also subject to data privacy and data security laws related to the personal information we collect from Learners (and Experts). It is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted in additional jurisdictions (such as the CCPA that recently entered into force in California and the CPRA that was recently passed), and certain proposals, if adopted, could harm our business through a decrease in consumer registrations and revenues, or through a change in marketing strategies; however, a federal data privacy and security standard, which is also a possibility, may provide substantial clarity and benefits for businesses that collect and maintain such data.
These regulations are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies.
As stated above, we remain subject to a variety of laws and regulations. We monitor changes to applicable state and federal regulations and believe we are in compliance with the existing interpretations or applications of such applicable state and federal regulations. There is also a possibility of retroactive application of new laws to the business as well.
For additional information regarding the impact of government regulation on our business and financial results, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
Data Privacy and Security
We prioritize the trust of Learners, Experts, schools, vendors, and employees, and place an emphasis on data privacy and security. The security and privacy programs are designed and implemented in an effort to address the security and compliance requirements of data related to Learners, Experts, schools, vendors, and employees.
We have a dedicated team of professionals that focus on application, network, and system security, as well as security compliance, education, and incident response. We maintain a vulnerability management program designed to identify security vulnerabilities on servers, workstations, and applications, and subsequent remediation of vulnerabilities. Regular internal and external penetration tests are also conducted and open items are remediated according to severity for any results found.
We rely on internet systems and infrastructure to operate our business, some of which are managed by third parties. We have implemented physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to help protect our systems. Our systems must be constantly updated, monitored, patched, and upgraded to optimize performance and protect against known and unknown vulnerabilities, material disruptions, or slowdown. We encrypt external data in transit and use security controls in order to control access to the resources containing personal data or other confidential information.
We design the platform, offerings, and policies to facilitate compliance with evolving privacy and data security laws and regulations. We post privacy policies online, and maintain certain other policies and practices relating to data security and concerning processing, use, and disclosure of personal information. We collect and use aggregated, end-user information to develop, provide, and improve our platform and offerings.
Our publication of the privacy policy and other statements regarding privacy and security may subject us to investigation or enforcement actions by state and federal regulators if they are found to be deficient, lacking transparency, deceptive, or misrepresentative of the practices. We also may be bound from time to time by contractual obligations related to its collection and use of certain personally identifiable information.
The privacy and data security laws and regulations to which we are subject, as well as their interpretation, are evolving and expected to continue to change over time. We continue to monitor the current landscape of privacy and security laws, as well as pending and emerging legislation, both in the U.S. and abroad. It is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted in additional jurisdictions (such as enacted state privacy laws in California, Virginia, and Colorado, for example), and certain proposals, if adopted, could harm our business through a decrease in consumer registrations and revenues, or through a change in marketing strategies; however, a federal data privacy and security standard, which is also a possibility, may provide substantial clarity and benefits for businesses that collect and maintain such data.
Other privacy and data security laws and regulations to which we may be subject include emerging state legislation, COPPA, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, TCPA, and Section 5(c) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Additionally, the Company may be subject to foreign privacy and data protection requirements including the European General Data Protection and Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. More generally, the various privacy and data security legal obligations that apply to us may evolve in a manner that relates to our practices or the features of its mobile application or website. We may need to take additional measures to comply with the new and evolving legal obligations and to maintain and improve the information security posture in an effort to avoid information security incidents or breaches affecting personal information or other sensitive or proprietary data.
For additional information regarding the impact of data privacy and security on our business, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to the business. We rely on trademarks, trade names, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to the platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which it registers our brand names and product names, taglines, and logos in the U.S. and other countries to the extent it is determined to be appropriate and cost-effective. As of February 14, 2022, we have several registered and pending trademarks in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, we have common law rights in some trademarks in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, as well as many registered copyrights in the U.S. We also have numerous registered domain names for websites that are used in the business, such as www.nerdy.com, and the businesses of the subsidiary entities, such as www.varsitytutors.com, and other businesses and their respective variations.
We continue to evaluate and act upon additional intellectual property protections to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective to do so. Despite efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. For additional information, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report.
