ITEM 1. BUSINESS.



The following discussion reflects the business of Vicarious Surgical, as currently embodied by Vicarious Surgical. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to the “Company”, “we,” “us” and “our” generally refer to Vicarious Surgical in the present tense or Vicarious Surgical from and after the Business Combination.



Overview



Prior to the Domestication and the Closing, we were a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On September 16, 2021, we incorporated as a Delaware corporation in connection with the Domestication. On September 17, 2021, we completed the Business Combination pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement dated April 15, 2021 that we entered into with Legacy Vicarious. In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination, we changed our name to “Vicarious Surgical Inc.” and the business of Legacy Vicarious became our business.



We are combining advanced miniaturized robotics, computer science and 3D visualization to build an intelligent and affordable, single-incision surgical robot, called the Vicarious System, that virtually transports surgeons inside the patient to perform minimally invasive surgery, or MIS. With our disruptive next-generation robotics technology, we are seeking to increase the efficiency of surgical procedures, improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Led by a visionary team of engineers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, we intend to deliver the next generation in robotic-assisted surgery, designed to solve the shortcomings of open surgery, and current laparoscopic and robot-assisted MIS. We have developed multiple prototypes, and had pre-submission meetings with the FDA to align on our regulatory strategy and plan to file a de novo application with the FDA for ventral hernia procedures as our first indication.



The Vicarious System is uniquely designed to overcome the deficiencies that have limited broad adoption of robot-assisted MIS to date. By fundamentally engineering a better solution, we believe we have created a more capable surgical robot than those currently available on the market, and if approved by the FDA, the Vicarious System will offer surgeons the ability to perform surgical procedures with greater dexterity and greater access to the entire abdomen, with better visibility and sensor-based feedback, through a small single incision in the abdomen. The Vicarious System features proprietary “de-coupled” actuators, which are intended to enable a cascade of benefits, including improved robotic mobility, reduced size, improved functionality and lower materials costs. The Vicarious System is designed to enable surgeons to perform procedures, if approved by the FDA, inside the abdomen with human-equivalent motion, with a full nine degrees of freedom per robotic arm, providing an experience that is more natural, and more akin to the surgeon’s own upper body movements. In surgical procedures conducted on cadavers, the Vicarious System provides exceptional reach within the abdomen, and if approved by the FDA, it will enable the surgeon to enter the abdomen from nearly any angle and work in nearly any direction, without having to triangulate to the surgical area from multiple incisions or to operate only within the limited area directly in front of a single incision. The Vicarious System is designed to provide exceptional visualization, with a high-performance, stereoscopic camera that rotates in three degrees of freedom (yaw, pitch, and roll) to provide the surgeon with stereoscopic imaging of nearly every surface in the abdomen. The Vicarious System also contains 28 sensors per instrument arm, which allows the system to provide real-time feedback to the surgeon on force, motion and other key data that are intended to enhance surgical procedures and patient outcomes.

The Vicarious System is being developed to provide attractive advantages to hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers, or ASCs, which we believe will drive rapid and widespread adoption. Unlike the large footprints of legacy surgical robotic systems that require a construction build-out and a dedicated operating room, the Vicarious System is much smaller and could be easily moved to any operating room throughout a medical facility. We anticipate that, if approved by the FDA, the smaller size and advanced engineering of the Vicarious System and related disposable instruments will be offered at a cost-effective price point compared to existing legacy robotic systems. Hospitals and ASCs would not be required to dedicate permanent space and would reduce expenses relating to sterilization and operating room turnover. We believe that, if approved by the FDA, adoption of the Vicarious System could be facilitated by a streamlined training regimen, where surgeons will be able to develop proficiency much more quickly than for legacy robotic systems. This is due to the design features of the Vicarious System, such as the ease of use and more natural, human-equivalent motion of the Vicarious System, the reduced surgeon burden during setup, and the fact that the Vicarious System would not be confined to a dedicated operating suite and therefore could have more availability for training purposes. In addition, with its increased capability and dexterity, the Vicarious System is designed to enable many procedures to be performed faster and more effectively, with less injury and risk to the patient, significantly reducing overall healthcare costs. Because the Vicarious System had not yet been approved by the FDA or commercialized, the intended advantages of the Vicarious System have not yet been realized and are dependent upon the successful development of the Vicarious System and a timely approval by the FDA.



We estimate that there are 39 million soft tissue abdominal and gynecological surgical procedures performed annually worldwide that could be addressed with the Vicarious System, including ventral hernia, other types of hernia, hysterectomy, cholecystectomy (gall bladder) and certain other gastrointestinal procedures. We intend for ventral hernia procedures to be the first clinical application for the Vicarious System, of which there are estimated to be 4.1 million cases worldwide and 0.9 million in the U.S. We then intend to seek FDA approval to enable the expansion into the other applications addressable by the Vicarious System.



Industry Background



Despite the advancements in manual and robot-assisted MIS over the last 40 years, of the estimated 39 million procedures addressable by the Vicarious System, it is estimated that more than 50% are currently performed by open surgery and less than 5% are performed by existing robot-assisted MIS technologies today. The large incisions required for open surgery, while allowing the surgeon to see with their own eyes and operate with their own hands, create significant trauma to the patient, resulting in long hospitalization and recovery times, high hospitalization costs, as well as significant pain and suffering. Due to the significant trauma to the patient associated with open surgery, 15% to 20% of such surgeries result in tissue or internal organs pushing through the muscle into the abdomen, or incisional hernias, caused by the operation, requiring additional complex surgery to correct. Although there have been significant improvements in MIS procedures over open surgery, the following limitations associated with MIS still exist:

● | Laparoscopic surgery results in improved patient outcomes, but it presents significant challenges for surgeons, primarily associated with using long, rigid instruments through multiple incisions across the abdominal wall, which introduces the “fulcrum effect” requiring the surgeon to adjust for the inversion and scaling of movements. These laparoscopic instruments are difficult to manipulate, have limited degrees of freedom, limited reach and reduced depth-perception and visibility, which requires significant coordination among the surgical team to perform the procedure.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Multi-port robotic systems introduced in the early 2000s have managed to overcome some of the challenges associated with laparoscopy, but they require multiple incisions. While the wristed robotic instruments provide more dexterity than the long, rigid instruments used in laparoscopy, these robotic systems still require multiple systems and require the surgeon to define the workspace and kinematic motion profile of the robotic system for every procedure, based on where they create the incisions and where they intend to operate. Additionally, these systems are expensive and require a difficult learning-curve for surgeons. In addition, these systems are often underutilized because they have large footprints, limited portability and require extensive setup and longer operating room turnover time.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | More recently, single-port surgical robots have been developed, but these systems are limited in that they rely on legacy robotic architecture, and thus require a much larger incision than multi-port robotic systems, have limited motion, strength, and visualization, and can only operate in a small procedural area. Given the relatively large size of the trocar incision required to be made by the surgeon to accommodate existing single-port robotic systems, among other limitations, these existing single-port robots have unfortunately resulted in significantly higher rates of complications with higher levels of injury to the patient, with less capability for the surgeon. For all these reasons, legacy single-port robotic solutions, much like multi-port manual and robotic MIS, have received limited adoption to date.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We believe the slow adoption of robot-assisted surgery, estimated to be less than 5% of the estimated 39 million addressable abdominal soft-tissue surgical procedures performed worldwide annually, has occurred because of several factors, including the following:




● | Significant Capital Investment. Legacy robotic systems require high upfront acquisition costs and burdensome annual service contracts that are often prohibitively expensive, especially in outpatient settings. We estimate these capital costs to be up to $2.0 million or more per system upfront, plus an additional 10% to 20% annually for maintenance and service contracts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Low Utilization. In addition to the significant acquisition costs, existing robotic systems create inefficiencies and increase costs to medical facilities considering adoption. Due to their large size and limited portability, existing robotic systems require the construction of a dedicated operating room, occupying valuable real estate within the hospital. Once in place, these robotic systems require extensive set-up and operating room turnover times, which limits the number of procedures that can be performed with the robotic system. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Limited Capabilities. Existing robotic systems have limited capabilities and are ill-suited for many outpatient procedures. Due to their limited degrees of freedom inside the abdomen, they depend on significant, complicated, robotic motion outside the body, and they have limited ability to operate in multiple quadrants, difficulty operating on the “ceiling” of the abdomen, create collisions inside and outside of the patient’s abdomen, and restrict overall access of the operating team to the patient.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Difficult to Use. Existing robotic systems require the surgeon to develop an extensive procedure plan in advance to determine appropriate incision sites and angles for each procedure, in order to avoid collisions inside and outside of the patient’s abdomen. Surgeons must develop this plan with fewer degrees of freedom than they would employ using open surgery, restricting their natural movements. To become proficient at manipulating these legacy robotic systems to perform the procedures they otherwise were trained to perform via open surgery requires extensive training and several dozen procedures on live patients. As these systems are maintained in dedicated, expensive, operating rooms, obtaining access to train on the system becomes a significant impediment to adoption, resulting in more open surgeries.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Vicarious System



The single-port Vicarious System with advanced, miniaturized robotics and exceptional visualization is designed to address the significant limitations of open surgery and existing single- and multi-port robotic surgical approaches to improve patient outcomes and enhance adoption by hospitals and other medical facilities. The Vicarious System is designed with a fundamentally different architecture, and proprietary “de-coupled actuators,” to overcome many of the limitations of open surgery or existing robot-assisted surgical procedures with a minimally invasive and more capable robotic system. This architecture enables unprecedented dexterity inside the abdomen through an ultra-thin support tube, providing significant improvement over existing legacy robotic systems and minimizing the complications and trauma associated with open surgery. The Vicarious System has not yet been approved by the FDA. We have had pre-submission meetings with the FDA to align on our regulatory strategy and plan to file a de novo application with the FDA for ventral hernia procedures as our first indication.

(1) | The Vicarious System is capable of incision sizes as low as 1.2cm. Current disposables require 1.8cm incisions. We are developing and expect to launch disposables requiring 1.5cm incisions.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The Vicarious System consists of the following components:




● | Camera and Instrument Arms. The Vicarious System has a high performance stereoscopic camera that, when combined with robotic motion, provides full 360-degree viewing capability and is being developed to continuously map the depth of the patient’s body. The camera moves in any direction and, together with the instrument arms, based on cadaver studies, the Vicarious System is capable of operating in nearly every direction within the abdomen, including rotating back and operating around the trocar incision point, unlike any robotic system on the market today. The Vicarious System’s surgical instrument arms each have nine degrees of movement, completely mimicking the degrees of freedom in the surgeon’s own wrists, elbows and shoulders, providing for a more complete and more natural range of motion for the surgeon. While existing robotic systems are limited to operating in a small section directly in front of the rigid instrument, the Vicarious System’s unique ability to operate in nearly every direction is designed to provide significantly more capability to the surgeon, while minimizing the injury and trauma to the patient. The camera and both instrument arms are being developed to enter the abdomen through a single, 1.8 centimeter trocar, which is anticipated to be reduced to a 1.5 centimeter trocar as development continues, that is within the size of conventional MIS trocars. Due to the smaller size of the Vicarious System, it will be able to provide significantly more sensing capability than existing systems, if the Vicarious System receives FDA approval. The Vicarious System features 28 sensors per arm, to provide valuable feedback to the surgeon in real-time, and the sensors will also be capable of providing robust intraoperative data to continually enhance our AI capabilities and enhance surgeon capabilities over the long-term.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Surgeon Console. The Vicarious System surgeon console is designed to provide all the systems necessary for the surgeon to have an effective, immersive experience, visualizing the surgical field and controlling all the motions of the robot, and if approved by the FDA, enabling performance and patient outcomes that are not available on other existing systems. When the surgeon wants to simultaneously engage and react to other activities within the operating room as well as what is going on inside the abdomen, he or she can utilize the 3D surgical screen powered by proprietary software. In addition, visualization can be deeply immersive using a head mounted display that responds to the motion of the surgeon’s own head and allows the surgeon to feel as if he or she is “inside” the patient. Currently, the initial launch of the Vicarious System will not have the ability to utilize a head mounted display for visualization, but we anticipate providing surgeons with this ability as development continues.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patient Cart. The Vicarious System patient cart is designed to be only 34 inches wide, which could easily pass through the doorways of hospitals, outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, and any standard doorway, alleviating the equipment maneuverability concerns experienced by healthcare providers with competitor surgical robotics systems. Unlike existing robotic systems, the Vicarious System, if approved by the FDA, would not require a dedicated operating room and could be wheeled into or out of any room, or stored in the hall, as the hospital does with other medical devices, significantly expanding accessibility to the system. Further, as most of the robotic motion occurs inside the abdomen in a single port, the Vicarious System does not have multiple, expensive, high-performance robotic arms outside the body, pivoting around the incision point to make small movements inside the body. We believe that these factors, together with the ability to utilize more advanced, sometimes less expensive manufacturing processes, will enable the Vicarious System to be significantly less expensive to build than competitive robotic systems, based on their publicly available data.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vicarious System Advantages



We believe that to overcome the issues that have limited broad adoption of robot-assisted MIS procedures to date: cost, size, capability, ease of use, fast setup, high throughput, streamlined training, and improved patient outcomes, it is imperative to provide a solution that addresses all these concerns. The Vicarious System, with its advanced engineering and “de-coupled actuators,” which enable a revolutionary approach to the development of surgical robotics, is designed to be uniquely able to significantly improve upon each of these factors. Because of its proprietary engineering advantage, the Vicarious System is designed to offer more degrees of freedom and dexterity with which the surgeon can more naturally operate, and to provide greater visibility, sensing and functionality to the surgeon, all through a small, single port that is designed to offer more capability and fewer challenges than any single or multi-port surgical modality available. Because the Vicarious System had not yet been approved by the FDA or commercialized, the intended advantages of the Vicarious System have not yet been realized and are dependent upon the successful development of the Vicarious System and a timely approval by the FDA.

● | Decoupled Actuators. Robotic arms are controlled by actuators at each joint. Traditionally, these actuators are “coupled,” meaning that movement of one joint causes movement at each subsequent or prior joint. This coupled motion can be corrected by legacy robots via complicated software to coordinate and eliminate the unwanted motion between these joints that would otherwise be created. However, the software cannot eliminate the exponential buildup of force across these joints caused by this coupled action. This exponential force buildup requires stronger cables and pulleys and other expensive and larger components, which adds significant size, cost, and limits the available mobility of legacy robotic systems. By fundamentally engineering a better solution, we have decoupled the motion between these actuators, reducing cost and integrating components and materials that enable enhanced visibility, flexibility and strength, which in turn are intended to provide significant benefits for surgeons, hospitals, ASCs and patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Surgeon Experience
--+-------------------


● | Human Equivalent Motion — Nine Degrees of Freedom. The Vicarious System is the only robotic system, compared to all legacy single- or multi-port solutions, to offer the same nine full degrees of freedom that exist in the natural motion of the surgeon’s own wrists, elbows and shoulders, providing unprecedented dexterity in a robot-assisted MIS. While other legacy robotic systems require the surgeon to conform and limit their movements to what the robot will enable, in cadaver studies, the Vicarious System offers the nearly full range of motion of the surgeon’s own upper body, providing an experience that is more natural, and more akin to what they know best, open surgery, except miniaturized and transformed inside the body.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expanded Reach Inside the Abdomen. With the full nine degrees of freedom provided by the Vicarious System, as shown in cadaver studies, the surgeon can enter the abdomen from nearly any angle and work in nearly any direction, with more freedom, all through a small single incision. Legacy robotic systems and manual MIS require the surgeon to triangulate to the surgical area and limit the surgeon to performing only in a small section directly in front of the incision. The Vicarious System’s unprecedented reach is designed to enable the surgeon to pivot in nearly any direction during surgery and the surgeon can even pivot backwards and operate near the incision site.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sensing, Visualization and AI. The surgeon can utilize the 3D screen on the console and eventually the surgeon will have the ability to utilize a head mounted display for visualization. The Vicarious System’s high-performance, stereoscopic camera can rotate in nearly every direction, following the natural motion of the surgeon’s head, and is being developed to provide full 3D mapping. The Vicarious System contains more than two dozen sensors per arm, designed to provide unmatched sensing capability that is being developed to deliver valuable feedback on force, motion and other key data, to the surgeon in real-time. These sensors also will be used to feed our rapidly expanding need for data and AI development, which will be utilized to further enhance surgical procedures and provide a significant link and insight between pre- and peri-operative data and patient outcomes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hospital and Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC) Advantages
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | System Size. Unlike legacy systems that require a construction build-out simply to fit their system into a dedicated operating room, the Vicarious System is designed to be small enough to fit through a single door. This is intended to enable faster set-up and break-down times, allowing the Vicarious System to be used anywhere within the facility.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Training. Because of the more natural motion of the Vicarious System, together with the fact that it is not confined to a dedicated operating suite like most legacy robotic systems, the Vicarious System can be more available for surgeons to practice, and it is expected that surgeons would be able to develop proficiency more quickly and easily than with legacy systems, which could improve surgeon adoption and enhance hospital and ASC return on investment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Economics/System Cost. If approved by the FDA, we intend to offer the Vicarious System, maintenance and service support at more attractive pricing to existing legacy systems. With its increased capability and dexterity, it is expected that many procedures could be performed faster and more effectively, which could greatly reduce overall hospital costs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Disposability. Our instruments and accessories have been designed and will be offered at a price that enables them to be used once and then disposed. Hospitals and ASCs will no longer need to dedicate space and expense to ensure these items are properly sterilized and available for re-use.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Patient Outcomes
--+-----------------


● | Enhanced Capability. The Vicarious System will be designed to provide increased visualization and capability to the surgeon, and if the FDA approves the Vicarious System, it is intended to allow the surgeon to more easily perform advanced techniques that are proven in existing clinical use to provide for better patient outcomes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Smaller Trocar — Fewer Complications. In open surgery, due to the large size of the incision, the incision fails to heal properly 15-20% of the time, a complication requiring additional surgery to fix. Multi-port manual and robot-assisted MIS, while significantly less capable than the Vicarious System is designed to be, utilize small trocars (i.e., 8mm to 12mm), which greatly reduces this risk to approximately 1%. Existing single-port robots utilize at least a 25mm trocar size, which have a failure rate of nearly 10%, beginning to approach the failure rate of open surgery. The Vicarious System, like multi-port MIS, is designed to utilize a small trocar, which could enable superior results with the lowest overall risk. Currently, the Vicarious System utilizes an 18mm trocar, which is anticipated to be reduced to a 15mm trocar as development continues.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy



With revolutionary advancements in design, we seek to democratize surgery through widespread access to a more capable and more affordable surgical robotic platform. Our objective is to become the leading provider of surgical robotic platforms for soft tissue surgery. To achieve this objective, we are pursuing the following business strategies, all of which are dependent upon the receipt of FDA clearance:

● | Drive adoption of the Vicarious System initially in the ventral hernia market. We plan to initially focus our marketing efforts on surgeons and hospitals performing surgical procedures in general surgery, gynecology and other procedures that will benefit from our single incision platform. We believe our innovative system will deliver clinical and economic value that will address the unmet need in today’s surgical operating rooms. Our strategy is to work with key thought leaders in general surgery, gynecology and other specialties who can help provide feedback that will help guide our product roadmap and surgical techniques.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand indications. The ability to have universal access to the abdomen with the Vicarious System also presents opportunities of other procedures that we plan to target in the near future. Some of the future indications that are being targeted are inguinal and hiatal hernias, hysterectomy, cholecystectomy (gallbladder), colorectal and other gastrointestinal procedures. We estimate that 39 million of these procedures are performed annually today.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Generate recurring revenue. After the initial installation of the Vicarious System, our goal is to increase the utilization of the Vicarious System by demonstrating the procedural and workflow efficiency of the System. Faster set up and procedure times with the Vicarious System can enable hospitals and ASCs to potentially schedule more procedures, which would in turn drive volume sales of single use components, including the robotic arms, camera and instrument tips.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Demonstrate clinical and financial value proposition. Over 50% of ventral hernia procedures are performed as open surgical procedures in the hospital. We aim to capitalize on the trend of moving procedures from hospitals to ASCs. Additionally, we believe that the Vicarious System can accelerate the ability to perform complex hernia surgeries with an MIS procedure in an ASC as opposed to a hospital. However, ASCs typically do not have significant capital budgets to justify large capital purchases, nor do they have infrastructure budgets to undertake the construction of a dedicated operating suite. The Vicarious System’s value proposition is designed to appeal to these ASCs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand product offerings. We believe that technologies such as virtual reality and AI have the potential to further enhance a surgeon’s capabilities. We plan to develop advanced AI features, such as 3D depth mapping, and automated suturing, to be incorporated into future generations of the Vicarious System.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Commercialization outside U.S. If the FDA clears the Vicarious System for commercialization in the U.S., we intend to seek applicable regulatory clearances or approvals in Asia, Europe and the rest of the world to commercialize the Vicarious System worldwide.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Historical Development of the Vicarious System and Regulatory Pathway



The technology for our robot was developed by Legacy Vicarious founders Adam Sachs, Sammy Khalifa, and Barry Greene between 2009 and 2015. After considerable prototyping and experimentation, the team discovered and patented a cable pathway through the robotic arm to fully de-couple the motion of the robotic device. This series of innovations enabled the first successful prototype of a complete robotic arm that resembles the motion of the surgeon’s body. The founding team went on to take this design and create a full prototype of the device, machining the parts themselves and funding the project out of pocket. After the first fully functioning robotic arm was created, integrated with software designed by the Legacy Vicarious founders, as well as a surgeon input tracking system, the founding team was able to raise outside capital and successfully grow the team in order to continue to drive development and growth.



We have conducted, and continue to conduct, several cadaver studies with the prototype Vicarious System. The goal of each study was to refine the performance of the Vicarious System. In these cadaver studies, the Vicarious System prototype was used to perform several ventral hernia repair procedures, hysterectomy procedures and cholecystectomy procedures. In addition, in these cadaver studies surgeons have used the Vicarious System prototype to perform various techniques for ventral hernia repair, including robotic transabdominal preperitoneal, or rTAPP, retrorectus, and intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair (IPOM) plus. These studies were used to gather insights regarding:




● | The length of the robotic instruments needed to perform ventral hernia repair;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Field and depth of view of the robotic camera;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | User interface elements, such as the clutch pedal, navigation pedals and digital interface elements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Quality of robotic end-effector motion in response to surgeon hand motion;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Insertion and extraction workflow; and
--+---------------------------------------


● | Reliability of the robotic instruments and camera.
--+---------------------------------------------------




In November 2019, we received FDA Breakthrough Device designation for a prior version of the Vicarious System with a proposed indication for use of ventral hernia repair. The Vicarious System is considered a Class II medical device. We have had pre-submission meetings with the FDA to align on our regulatory strategy and plan to file a de novo application with the FDA for ventral hernia procedures as our first indication.



A preliminary meeting with the FDA was conducted in December 2021 to discuss with the FDA our decision to make two technology changes to the Vicarious System design that was granted Breakthrough Device designation in November 2019. Based on these changes, the FDA has determined that the current Vicarious System design that is planned for the initial limited launch and was submitted to the FDA in the November 2021 FDA pre-submission meeting request is different from the device that was granted Breakthrough Device designation for the device design filed in November 2019. The FDA stated that the Breakthrough Device designation remains active for the prior device design granted Breakthrough Device designation in November 2019. In the future, we may attempt to reincorporate the technologies from such prior device design to leverage the previously granted Breakthrough Device designation. The process of medical device development is inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that a Breakthrough Device designation will be granted to a different device design, and if it were granted, there is no guarantee that such designation will accelerate the timeline for approval or make it more likely that the Vicarious System will be approved.



In February 2022 a pre-submission meeting was held with the FDA to gain alignment on the current Vicarious System. Feedback provided by the FDA indicated that each robotic-assisted surgical system has distinctive kinetics, connections, data transmission and interfaces, including interfaces for the user, patient and environment, the combination of which composes a unique and multifaceted system. Additionally, the FDA indicated that each robotic-assisted surgical system has unique inputs and outputs and must account for uncertainty and instability in different ways. Taken together, these different technological characteristics raise different questions of safety or effectiveness that are not applicable to a predicate device and may pose a significant safety or effectiveness concern for the Vicarious System. For example, the way that a robotic-assisted surgical system is constructed and implemented will have a direct bearing on the safety and effectiveness profile of the device and different robotic-assisted surgical systems are not sufficiently similar to allow for meaningful comparison between the Vicarious System and predicate robotic-assisted surgical systems. The FDA indicated that the evaluation of the complex Vicarious System requires a holistic approach of the performance testing, such as software, bench, animal, human factors and usability, and clinical data to determine how each element establishes the Vicarious System’s integration approach to the intended use and more specifically the indicated procedures. Therefore, each robotic-assisted surgical system carries new or different risks and an evaluation of these risks will require an independent evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the Vicarious System due to the technology and the implementation into the clinical care. Based on this feedback, the FDA has determined that a 510(k) submission would likely be found not substantially equivalent to a predicate robotic-assisted surgical system. In accordance with this FDA feedback, we have revised our regulatory roadmap for market clearance, as discussed below.

Regulatory Roadmap for Market Clearance



Based on the outcome of the pre-submission meeting with the FDA in February 2022, the FDA has determined that there is no legally marketed predicate device. Therefore, we will plan to file a de novo classification request for the proposed initial indication of ventral hernia repair as a regulatory pathway to classify the Vicarious System. Devices that are classified into Class I or Class II through a de novo classification request may be marketed and used as predicates for future premarket notification 510(k) submissions, when applicable. Accordingly, we believe that 510(k) filings will be available as a regulatory pathway for the Vicarious System with respect to future indications.



We will conduct a prospective human pivotal clinical investigation under a FDA Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and performance of the Vicarious System to obtain U.S. market clearance for the proposed indication of ventral hernia repair. In addition to conducting a human pivotal clinical investigation, we will conduct non-clinical testing activities to verify and validate the safety, performance, effectiveness, functionality, usability and reliability characteristics of the Vicarious System with respect to the intended use and defined requirements. A verification and validation process is expected to provide the necessary data to submit to the FDA for IDE approval.



Non-clinical verification and validation testing will be conducted to verify and validate that the Vicarious System meets all design specifications for its intended use. These tests will include in-vitro, simulated clinical bench testing and cadaver studies, as well as animal studies to support and demonstrate the safety, performance, effectiveness, functionality, usability, and reliability characteristics of the Vicarious System with respect to the intended use and defined requirements. Cadaver studies, representing realistic dimensions and contours of the human abdominal space, will be used primarily to verify and validate system functionality, performance, and safety relevant to patient anatomy and contexts of use with respect to insertion, access and movement within the abdominal cavity, visualization, manipulating tissue, cutting, and suturing as needed during a simulated ventral hernia repair. Animal studies will be used primarily to demonstrate performance, safety, efficacy, and usability of the system as relevant to a live model with respect to insertion, access and movement within the abdominal cavity, visualization, manipulating tissue, cutting, coagulating, and suturing, during a simulated ventral hernia repair. This testing may also be used to demonstrate that applicable risk mitigation features, including software alarms, alerts, extraction of multi-jointed instrumentation in case of system failure, misuse, or other errors are adequate and perform to specifications. Summative usability testing will be conducted by surgeons, nurses and technicians in a simulated operating room environment to provide objective evidence that the Vicarious System can be used safely and effectively by end users for its intended uses, the device functions as expected and intended, and all risk mitigations implemented are safe and effective. In addition, we will conduct simulated bench-top testing on transparent anatomical models to evaluate, among other things, how the Vicarious System performs in “worst case” scenarios to verify and validate safe anatomical access, instrument/camera angulation and movement at the extremes of various surgical procedures with respect to patient anatomy and dimensions that cannot be readily controlled for when using live animal and human cadaver models.



Future Indications



We plan to expand upon our claims and/or indication for use to address additional unmet clinical needs in different anatomical areas as well as therapeutic procedures. Following the initial clearance for ventral hernia repair under a de novo classification, if obtained by the FDA, we plan to submit additional 510(k) filings for other indications for use, using the Vicarious System’s first de novo authorization as a predicate, along with other predicate devices with similar cleared indications for use. We have identified several potential future indications and procedures that align well with the Vicarious System’s ability to access and visualize the abdominal cavity. Possible future indications may include but not be limited to inguinal and hiatal hernias, hysterectomy, cholecystectomy (gallbladder), colorectal and other gastrointestinal procedures. We will perform an assessment to determine the appropriate regulatory strategy required to expand claims and obtain applicable regulatory approvals in the United States and in other global markets.

Intellectual Property



General



We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to our business by seeking, maintaining and defending our intellectual property, all of which has been developed internally and not in-licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of surgical robotics. Additionally, we intend to rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity and market exclusivity as well as patent term extensions, where available.



We currently do not rely heavily on technologies from third parties. However, in the future, we may need to rely or be dependent on patented or proprietary technologies that we may license from third parties.



We maintain a patent portfolio that includes issued U.S. and foreign patents as well as pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, which include claims directed towards our proprietary technology. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. As of March 1, 2022, we owned approximately six (6) issued U.S. patents, approximately two (2) issued patents in foreign jurisdictions including one (1) in China and one (1) in Japan, and approximately 40 pending patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including in Canada, China, Europe, Japan and India. These issued patents and pending patent applications (if they were to issue as patents) are all utility patents and have expected expiration dates ranging between 2035 and 2042. Our patents and patent applications are directed to, among other things, our core technology. This includes the surgical robotic and camera system; sensing capabilities, controls and visualization interfaces; the surgical tools suite; and related technologies.



The term of individual patents may vary based on the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date.



In addition to patents and patent applications, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, and obtain and maintain ownership of certain technologies, in part, through confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how, including by implementing measures intended to maintain the physical security of our premises and the physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.



Our future commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products will depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. Moreover, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the Vicarious System generally, as well as with respect to certain surgical indications. See the section entitled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.

Research and Development



As of March 1, 2022, our research and development programs are generally pursued by our 89 engineering, scientific and technical personnel employed by us in our offices in Massachusetts and California on a full-time basis or as consultants, or through partnerships with industry leaders in manufacturing and design and with researchers in academia. We are also working with subcontractors in developing specific components of our technologies.



The primary objectives of our research and development efforts are to continue to introduce incremental enhancements to the capabilities of the Vicarious System and to advance development.



For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred research and development expenses of approximately $22.1 million compared to research and development expenses of approximately $9.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.



Manufacturing



We are expanding our manufacturing capabilities with the development of a manufacturing facility, including a clean room, within our new headquarters in Waltham, Massachusetts, and has hired key manufacturing personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacturing of certain products for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing.



We purchase both custom and off-the-shelf components from a large number of suppliers and subjects them to stringent quality specifications and processes. Some of the components necessary for the assembly of the Vicarious System are currently provided to us by sole-sourced suppliers or single-sourced suppliers.



Competition



We face competition in the forms of existing open surgery, conventional MIS, drug therapies, radiation treatment, and emerging interventional surgical approaches. Our success depends on continued clinical and technical innovation, quality and reliability, as well as educating hospitals, surgeons, and patients on the results associated with robotic-assisted surgery using the Vicarious System and our value proposition relative to other techniques. We also face competition from several companies that have introduced or are developing new approaches and products for the MIS market. We believe that the entrance or emergence of competition validates robotic-assisted surgery.



We face competition from larger and well-established companies. The companies that have introduced products in the field of robotic-assisted surgery or have made explicit statements about their efforts to enter the field, include, but are not limited to: Intuitive Surgical, Inc.; Johnson & Johnson (including their wholly-owned subsidiaries Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., Auris Health, Inc. and Verb Surgical Inc.); Medtronic plc (including their wholly-owned subsidiary Covidien LP); Virtual Incision Corporation; Titan Medical Inc.; Stryker Corporation; and CMR Surgical Ltd. Other companies with substantial experience in industrial robotics could potentially expand into the field of surgical robotics and become a competitor. In addition, research efforts utilizing computers and robotics in surgery are underway at various companies and research institutions. Our ability to generate future revenue may be adversely impacted as competitors announce their intent to enter these markets and as our potential customers anticipate the availability of competing products.



Commercialization



We have not yet established a sales or product distribution infrastructure for the Vicarious System. We plan to access the U.S. market with the Vicarious System through strategic partnerships and will also develop our own focused, specialized sales force or distribution channels once we have commercialized the Vicarious System.

Government Regulation



Our operations are subject to comprehensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we or our research and development partners or affiliates do business. The laws and regulations governing our business and interpretations of those laws and regulations and are subject to frequent change. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon our ability, and that of our research and development partners and affiliates, to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The laws and regulations relating to medical products and healthcare services that apply to our business and that of our partners and affiliates continue to evolve, and we must, therefore, devote significant resources to monitoring developments in legislation, enforcement, and regulation in such areas. As the applicable laws and regulations change, we are likely to make conforming modifications in our business processes from time to time. We cannot provide assurance that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the regulatory environment will not change in a way that restricts our operations.



FDA Regulation



Medical devices are strictly regulated by the FDA, in the United States. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, a medical device is defined as “an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component, part or accessory which is, among other things: intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes.” This definition provides a clear distinction between a medical device and other FDA regulated products such as drugs. If the primary intended use of a medical product is achieved through chemical action or by being metabolized by the body, the product is usually a drug or biologic. If not, it is generally a medical device.



We are currently developing a robotic-assisted surgical system, which is regulated by the FDA as a medical device under the FDCA, as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, advertising, promotion, marketing, distribution, import, export, and post-market surveillance of our medical devices.



Device Premarket Regulatory Requirements



Before being introduced into the U.S. market, each medical device must obtain marketing clearance or approval from the FDA through the premarket notification (or 510(k)) process, the de novo classification process, or the premarket approval, or PMA, process, unless they are determined to be Class I devices or to otherwise qualify for an exemption from one of these available forms of premarket review and authorization by the FDA. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes — Class I, Class II or Class III — depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Classification of a device is important because the class to which a device is assigned determines, among other things, the necessity and type of FDA review required prior to marketing the device. Class I devices are those for which reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness can be maintained through adherence to general controls that include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or the QSR, as well as regulations requiring facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. The Class I designation also applies to devices for which there is insufficient information to determine that general controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device or to establish special controls to provide such assurance, but that are not life-supporting or life-sustaining or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, and that do not present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury.





12







Class II devices are those for which general controls alone are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness and there is sufficient information to establish “special controls.” These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance requirements, patient registries and FDA guidance documents describing device-specific special controls. While most Class I devices are exempt from the premarket notification requirement, most Class II devices require a premarket notification prior to commercialization in the United States; however, the FDA has the authority to exempt Class II devices from the premarket notification requirement under certain circumstances. As a result, manufacturers of most Class II devices must submit premarket notifications to the FDA under Section 510(k) of the FDCA (21 U.S.C. § 360(k)) in order to obtain the necessary clearance to market or commercially distribute such devices. To obtain 510(k) clearance, manufacturers must submit to the FDA adequate information demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a “predicate device” that is already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to PMA, meaning, (i) a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (“preamendments device”) and for which a PMA is not required, (ii) a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or (iii) a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device identified by the applicant in a premarket notification submission, the FDA will grant 510(k) clearance for the new device, permitting the applicant to commercialize the device. Premarket notifications are subject to user fees, unless a specific exemption applies.



If there is no adequate predicate to which a manufacturer can compare its proposed device, the proposed device is automatically classified as a Class III device. In such cases, a device manufacturer must then fulfill the more rigorous PMA requirements or can request a risk-based classification determination for its device in accordance with the de novo classification process.



Devices that are intended to be life sustaining or life supporting, devices that are implantable, devices that present a potential unreasonable risk of harm or are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of health, and devices that are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device and for which safety and effectiveness cannot be assured solely by the general controls and special controls are placed in Class III. Such devices generally require FDA approval through the PMA process, unless the device is a preamendments device not yet subject to a regulation requiring premarket approval. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) process. For a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate through extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and one or more clinical trials, that the device is safe and effective for its proposed indication. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA submission, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review and determine whether the proposed device can be approved for commercialization, although in practice, PMA reviews often take significantly longer, and it can take up to several years for the FDA to issue a final decision. Before approving a PMA, the FDA generally also performs an on-site inspection of manufacturing facilities for the product to ensure compliance with the QSR.



The de novo classification process allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its device to Class I or Class II, on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, as an alternative to following the typical Class III device pathway requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, the FDA is required to classify a device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo classification request from an applicant; however, the most recent FDA premarket review goals state that in fiscal year 2021, FDA will attempt to issue a decision within 150 days of receipt on 65% of all de novo classification requests received during the year and on 70% of de novo requests received during fiscal year 2022. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the classification request must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. The FDA may reject the classification request if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) notification or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. De novo classification requests are subject to user fees, unless a specific exemption applies.





13







Clinical trials are almost always required to support PMAs and are sometimes required to support 510(k) and de novo classification submissions. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of investigational devices, and specify recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA denies the application or notifies us that the investigation is on hold and may not begin until the sponsor provides supplemental information about the investigation that satisfies the FDA’s concerns. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE that require modification of the study, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an institutional review board, or IRB, for each clinical site. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient according to criteria established by the FDA as part of the IDE regulations, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate authorization from the FDA, but must still comply with abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements.



Post-Marketing Restrictions and Enforcement



After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to:




● | submitting and updating establishment registration and device listings with the FDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, record maintenance, including maintenance of complaint and related investigation files, and other quality assurance controls during the manufacturing process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | unannounced routine or for-cause device facility inspections by the FDA, which may include our suppliers’ facilities; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved (or “off-label”) uses and impose other restrictions relating to promotional activities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply to certain Class II or III devices when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In addition, under the FDA medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device of such manufacturer were to recur. The decision to file an MDR involves a judgment by the manufacturer. If the FDA disagrees with the manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can take enforcement action.



The medical device reporting requirements also extend to health care facilities that use medical devices in providing care to patients, or “device user facilities,” which include hospitals, ambulatory surgical facilities, nursing homes, outpatient diagnostic facilities, or outpatient treatment facilities, but not physician offices. A device user facility must report any device-related death to both the FDA and the device manufacturer, or any device-related serious injury to the manufacturer (or, if the manufacturer is unknown, to the FDA) within 10 days of the event. Device user facilities are not required to report device malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur but may voluntarily report such malfunctions through MedWatch, the FDA’s Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program.





14







The FDA also has the authority to require the recall of commercialized medical device products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. The authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any distributed devices fail to meet established specifications, are otherwise misbranded or adulterated under the FDCA, or if any other material deficiency is found. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within ten working days after the recall is initiated.



The failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:




● | warning letters, fines, injunctions or civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | recalls, detentions or seizures of products;
--+---------------------------------------------


● | operating restrictions;
--+------------------------


● | delays in the introduction of products into the market;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | total or partial suspension of production;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | delay or refusal of the FDA or other regulators to grant 510(k) clearance, PMA approvals, or other marketing authorization to new products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | withdrawals of marketing authorizations; or
--+--------------------------------------------


● | in the most serious cases, criminal prosecution.
--+-------------------------------------------------




To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, medical device manufacturers are subject to market surveillance and periodic, pre-scheduled and unannounced inspections by the FDA, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors.



Breakthrough Device Designation



The 21st Century Cures Act, which was signed into law on December 13, 2016, established and directed FDA to implement the Breakthrough Devices Program. Under the program, device manufacturers may voluntarily request breakthrough designation for devices that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human disease or conditions over currently available technology and that meet at least one of the following criteria:

● | The device represents breakthrough technology;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | There are no approved or cleared alternatives for the device;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | The device offers significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Availability of the device is in the best interest of patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------






15







The goal of the Breakthrough Devices Program is to accelerate the timeline to market for novel devices that will likely provide a benefit to terminally or critically ill patients. A Breakthrough Device designation offers multiple benefits to the device manufacturer, including priority review of the pre-market submission for the device, opportunities to interact directly with FDA’s experts throughout the process, and engagement of FDA senior management.



In November 2019, we received FDA Breakthrough Device designation for a prior version of the Vicarious System with a proposed indication for use of ventral hernia repair. The Vicarious System is considered a Class II medical device. We have had pre-submission meetings with the FDA to align on our regulatory strategy and plan to file a de novo application with the FDA for ventral hernia procedures as our first indication.



A preliminary meeting with the FDA was conducted in December 2021 to discuss with the FDA our decision to make two technology changes to the Vicarious System design that was granted Breakthrough Device designation in November 2019. Based on these changes, the FDA has determined that the current Vicarious System design that is planned for the initial limited launch and was submitted to the FDA in the November 2021 FDA pre-submission meeting request is different from the device that was granted Breakthrough Device designation for the device design filed in November 2019. The FDA stated that the Breakthrough Device designation remains active for the prior device design granted Breakthrough Device designation in November 2019. In the future, we may attempt to reincorporate the technologies from such prior device design to leverage the previously granted Breakthrough Device designation. The process of medical device development is inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that a Breakthrough Device designation will be granted to a different device design, and if it were granted, there is no guarantee that such designation will accelerate the timeline for approval or make it more likely that the Vicarious System will be approved.



Federal Trade Commission Regulatory Oversight



Our advertising for our products and services is subject to federal truth-in-advertising laws enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, as well as comparable state consumer protection laws. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTC Act, the FTC is empowered, among other things, to (a) prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce; (b) seek monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers; and (c) gather and compile information and conduct investigations relating to the organization, business, practices, and management of entities engaged in commerce. The FTC has very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by the substantive requirements of the FTC Act and other consumer protection laws can result in administrative or judicial penalties, including civil penalties, injunctions affecting the manner in which we would be able to market services or products in the future, or criminal prosecution.
Healthcare Law and Regulation



If the Vicarious System or our other product candidates are approved in the United States, we will have to comply with various U.S. federal and state laws, rules and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws, rules and regulations. Violations of the fraud and abuse laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. These laws include the following:

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






16








● | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act require manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare or Medicaid to report, on an annual basis, to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, teaching hospitals, and certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners and physician ownership and investment interests; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Some state laws require pharmaceutical or medical device companies to comply with the relevant industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug and device manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures.



State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. We also may be subject to, or may in the future become subject to, U.S. federal and state, and foreign laws and regulations imposing obligations on how we collect, use, disclose, store and process personal information. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could result in liability or reputational harm and could harm our business. Ensuring compliance with such laws could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our customer base and thereby decrease our future revenues.



Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement



In the United States, third-party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, are responsible for hospital and surgeon reimbursement for covered surgical procedures. Third-party payors generally reimburse hospitals and physicians for surgery when the procedure is considered medically necessary. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, manages the Medicare program and administers the Medicaid program in conjunction with applicable state governments. Many commercial health insurers model their reimbursement methodologies after the Medicare program. As the single largest payor, the Medicare program has a significant impact on other third-party payors’ payment systems.





17







Generally, reimbursement for professional services performed at a facility by physicians is reported under billing codes issued by the American Medical Association, or AMA, known as Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes. Physician reimbursement under Medicare generally is based on a fee schedule and determined by the relative value of the professional service rendered. In addition, CMS and the National Center for Health Statistics are jointly responsible for overseeing changes and modifications to billing codes used by hospitals to report inpatient procedures, known as ICD-10-PCS codes. Under the Medicare program, CMS generally reimburses hospitals for services provided during an inpatient stay based on a prospective payment system that is determined by a classification system known as Medicare-Severity Diagnostic Related Groupings, or MS-DRGs. MS-DRGs are assigned using a number of factors, including the principal diagnosis, major procedures, discharged status, patient age, and complicating secondary diagnoses, among other things. Hospital outpatient services, reported by CPT codes, are assigned to clinically relevant Ambulatory Payment Classifications used to determine the payment amount for services provided.



Since October 1, 2015, a new family of ICD-10-PCS codes can be used, in conjunction with other applicable procedure codes, to describe various robotic-assisted procedures. An inpatient surgical procedure, completed with or without robotic assistance, continues to be assigned to the clinically relevant MS-DRG.



Third-party payors carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for medical products and surgical services. Reimbursement rates from commercial health insurers vary depending on the procedure performed, the specific payor’s reimbursement policies, contract terms, and other factors. Because both hospitals and physicians may receive the same reimbursement for a surgical procedure, whether it is performed with robotic assistance or not and regardless of actual costs incurred in furnishing the patient care, including for the specific medical products or supplies used during that procedure, hospitals and physicians may decide not to use our products if reimbursement amounts are insufficient to cover any additional costs incurred when purchasing and using our products.



For procedures that would involve assistance from our robotic-assisted surgical system, U.S. health care institutions typically bill various third-party payors, such as government health programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid) and commercial health insurance plans, for the primary surgical procedure only. If our robotic-assisted surgical system receives marketing authorization from the FDA, coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors will generally be determined by the medical necessity of the primary surgical procedure. Government health programs and other third-party payors may also consider additional factors when determining coverage and reimbursement, including the designation of the surgical procedure as a covered benefit, the appropriateness of the procedure for the specific patient, guidelines for the procedure established by the relevant professional college or medical society, and a payor determination that the procedure is neither experimental nor investigational. We believe that the procedures we intend to pursue as indications for use for our robotic-assisted surgical system are established surgical procedures that are generally already reimbursable by government health programs, commercial health insurers, and managed care organizations for appropriately selected patients. If hospitals do not obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed with our products, or if government and commercial payors’ policies do not cover surgical procedures performed using our products, we may not be able to generate the revenues necessary to support our business.



In the United States, there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”), was enacted. The ACA made changes that have significantly impacted healthcare providers, insurers, and manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. For example, the ACA included a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund health insurance coverage expansion, including, but not limited to, fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers.

There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and as a result certain of its sections have not been fully implemented or effectively repealed. In particular, in December of 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, effective January 1, 2019. In December 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court’s ruling that the individual mandate in the ACA was unconstitutional but remanded the case to the district court to determine whether other reforms enacted as part of the ACA but not specifically related to the individual mandate or health insurance could be severed from the rest of the ACA so as not to have the law declared invalid in its entirety. On March 2, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case and allocated one hour for oral arguments, which occurred on November 10, 2020. On February 10, 2021, the Department of Justice sent a letter to the U.S. Supreme Court that stated the new administration believes the individual mandate and its tax penalty are constitutional, and if the Court determines that they are not, the provision can be severed from the remainder of the act. With this letter, the Biden administration reversed the Trump administration position that was presented to the Court. The Trump administration had claimed that the tax provision is unconstitutional and could not be separated from the ACA, making the entire ACA unconstitutional as a result. The U.S. Supreme Court held in a 7–2 opinion that the states and individuals that brought the lawsuit challenging the ACA’s individual mandate do not have standing to challenge the law. The U.S. Supreme Court did not reach the merits of the challenge, but the decision ends the case. It is unclear how potential litigation and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will affect the implementation of that law, the pharmaceutical and medical device industries more generally, and our business. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. In addition, CMS published a final rule that would give states greater flexibility, effective January 1, 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the ACA and its possible repeal or replacement on our business.



In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, the Medicare sequester reductions under the Budget Control Act of 2011 was suspended from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, pursuant to provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, which also extended the sequester by one year, through 2030, in order to offset the added expense of the 2020 cancellation. The 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act was subsequently signed into law on December 27, 2020 and extends the CARES Act suspension period to March 31, 2021.



On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, enacted on April 16, 2015 (“MACRA”), repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments that began in 2019 and are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models, such as accountable care organizations. Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control medical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints and discounts, and require marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. Most recently, the Biden Administration has indicated that lowering healthcare costs and ensuring equitable patient access to medical care is a priority, but we do not yet know what steps the administration will take or whether such steps will be successful.



We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. We expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services. Moreover, if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our medical devices may lose any marketing authorization that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.
