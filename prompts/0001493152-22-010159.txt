Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Building on a history of over 1,700 new homes built and over 400 elevation/renovation/addition projects since 1993, the management of Dream Homes & Development Corporation has positioned the company to emerge as a rapidly growing regional developer of new single-family subdivisions as well as a leader in coastal new home and modular construction, elevation and mitigation. Since Superstorm Sandy flooded 40,000 owner-occupied homes, Dream Homes has helped hundreds of homeowners to build new homes or raise their homes to comply with new FEMA requirements. While other involved with coastal construction in Flood Hazard Areas have not been able to remain in business, Dream Homes has excelled. As many of our competitors have failed, Dream Homes has developed a reputation as the region’s most trusted builder and has even become known as the “rescue builders” for homeowners whose projects have been abandoned by others who have struggled to adapt to the changing market and complex Federal, State and local regulations. Due to the damage caused by the storm, as well as the material changes in the FEMA flood maps which now require over 40,000 homeowners along the New Jersey coastline to elevate their existing homes, or demolish and build new homes, Dream Homes is positioned to capitalize on this opportunity for substantial revenue growth.
 
Management anticipates steady growth in this division of the company, since the rebuilding process will continue indefinitely, and could have a market value in excess of $3,400,000,000. The company anticipates being able to address a percentage of this market. Dream Homes’ potential operations include the development and sale of a variety of residential communities, including construction of semi-custom homes, entry-level and first time move-up single-family and multi-family homes.
 
A new trend in the real estate market which has experienced significant growth in the last year is the emerging Build To Lease trend. This focus and concentration on building both single and multi-family developments with the intention to lease them immediately upon completion is being made in response to several factors. One factor is the extreme shortage of rental properties on the market, not only for first time homemakers, but for retirees, and young professionals who are unclear as to the intentions of settling in one location. The second factor is the overall lender and funding source preference to lend to Build To Lease developments, as opposed to more traditional Build To Sell developments due to the perception of Build To Lease as a safer investment over the long term. Finally, the extraordinary amount of interest from non-traditional sources such as pension and hedge funds, insurance companies and venture capital firms to purchase completed new For Lease developments at attractive metrics based on capitalization rates has spurred a large growth in this market segment.
 
The Company has made the decision to change focus in their new home developments to better accommodate this growing trend. Currently all new multi-family developments located in Ocean County, which represent a total count of 155 units, will be changed from Build For Sale to Build for Lease. The Company now intends to hold these properties upon completion and lease-up for an indeterminate period of time, and realize the rental income from ownership. This strategy will become a very significant revenue stream for the Company and will become a third division of the Company, behind custom new homes and renovation/elevation projects.
 
Recently, there has been an excessive amount of new business in the New Jersey market due to the effects of the Covid-19 virus. An excessive number of buyers from north Jersey and the New York metropolitan area have decided to act immediately towards building 2nd homes, with immediate plans for retirement.
 
In the first quarter of 2020, the Company signed a lease for an office in Brielle, NJ, which has served the Company’s growing Monmouth county market. Since opening this office, the Company has signed numerous contracts for new homes in the southern Monmouth county area.
 
In addition to the projects which the Company currently has under contract for elevation, renovation, new construction and development, there are a number of parcels of land which the Company has the ability to secure, whether through land contract or other types of options. These parcels represent additional opportunities for development and construction potential on the order of an additional 400 - 800 lots and/or residential units to be developed and built within an approximate time horizon of 5 years. Conceivably, this volume of production could yield $120,000,000 - $240,000,000 in gross revenue and $25,000,000 - $50,000,000 in earnings to the Company.
 
Management recognized that the effects of Super Storm Sandy (which occurred on 10/29/12) would be far reaching and cause an almost unlimited demand for construction services, as well as specific construction information. Due to the damage caused by the storm, as well as the material changes in the FEMA flood maps which now require over 40,000 homeowners along the New Jersey coastline to elevate their homes, management feels that focusing on the construction field will continue to provide a stable revenue stream for the company.
 
Due to the opportunities afforded by the market conditions, Dream Homes and Development Corporation will continue to pursue opportunities in the construction and real estate field, specifically in new home construction, home elevations and renovations.
 
In addition to the existing elevation, renovation and new home projects currently in process, Dream has also estimated an additional $5,800,000 worth of residential construction projects and currently has over 500 active prospects to its data base. All of these prospects are prime candidates new stick and modular homes, elevations and rebuilding projects.

This credit line is structured on an on-demand basis, bears an interest rate of 12% APR charged only for funds in use, and is in the amount of $1,000,000. This facility has been utilized in part to acquire the Berkeley Terrace, the 70 unit townhome property, as well as to further expand various aspects of the company.

Our initial investment goal is to evaluate each property to determine the best path to take in order to maximize potential return for that particular property. With new construction, our intention is to purchase either fully improved or at least fully approved properties. Fully approved properties includes those having all the entitlements and permits in hand, and as needed, to post performance guarantees and/or file subdivision maps, and/or proceed with infrastructure construction, such as utilities, roads and other site improvements. With new construction, we have adopted this business model to help reduce our exposure to the many risks and costs associated with land development.
 
From time to time, and as we come across an outstanding investment opportunity in land development priced at a level that justifies the inherent risks and costs associated with land development, the Company may contract for, and will bring through the approval process, various types of raw land. The Company will continue to allocate capital in the pursuit of approvals, since the risk/reward of developmental activity is so great. It should be noted that we do not generally take ownership of the property until the approval process has been completed, but rather control the property through contracts and options. In these instances, if we should fail to obtain approvals for any reason, whether through unsuitability, change of zoning or other factors, our loss shall be limited to the money expended for the approvals to that date. Our planned business model includes the acquisition, construction, and sale of a variety of residential properties, including construction of entry-level and first time move-up single-family and multi-family homes.

In addition to offering traditional stick frame construction of our homes, we may also offer modular and manufactured homes, townhomes and condominiums.
 
In our opinion, the most effective business model for residential development and construction is to target the largest current and future segment of the home buying market, which appears to be primarily first-time and move-up purchasers, as well as those homeowners forced to move or relocate due to Storm Sandy, another storm related event, or obsolescence of their existing property.
 
In our opinion, the southern New Jersey real estate market represents one of the most attractive real estate investment opportunities, with the greatest opportunity for future appreciation being concentrated in Ocean, Atlantic, Cape May, Monmouth and Middlesex counties. These areas primarily fall within 1-hour driving time, and serve as “bedroom” communities for, the Atlantic City, New York and Philadelphia metropolitan areas. In our opinion, the residential housing demand in this area, particularly in the market segments which we intend to address, enjoys a fundamental support level, based on several factors. These factors include excellent air, rail and road infrastructure (Atlantic City and Philadelphia), Casino and support services also in Atlantic City & Philadelphia, tourism, and a central location between Philadelphia and New York. Additionally, there has been a chronic affordable housing shortage throughout New Jersey and all indication are that condition will continue fot the foreseeable future. This situation plays well into the Company’s strengths, which are focused on entry-level or first time move-up housing, as well as elevations and renovations of existing damaged homes. Finally, all these market areas have tremendous growth potential due to market effects on the already very limited available housing supply.
