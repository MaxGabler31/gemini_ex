  ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
  
 As used in this Annual Report, “we,” “us,” “our,” “FitLife,” “FitLife Brands” “Company” or “our company” refers to FitLife Brands, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries.
 Overview
  
 FitLife Brands, Inc. (the “Company”) is a national provider of innovative and proprietary nutritional supplements for health-conscious consumers marketed under the brand names NDS Nutrition Products™ (“NDS”) (www.ndsnutrition.com), PMD™ (www.pmdsports.com), SirenLabs™ (www.sirenlabs.com), CoreActive™ (www.coreactivenutrition.com), and Metis Nutrition™ (www.metisnutrition.com) (together, “NDS Products”). With the consummation of the merger with iSatori, Inc. (“iSatori”) on September 30, 2015, which became effective on October 1, 2015, described below (the “Merger”), the Company added several brands to its product portfolio, including iSatori (www.isatori.com), BioGenetic Laboratories, and Energize (together, “iSatori Products”). The NDS Products are distributed principally through franchised General Nutrition Centers, Inc. (“GNC”) stores located both domestically and internationally, and, with the addition of Metis Nutrition, through corporate GNC stores in the United States. The iSatori Products are sold through more than 25,000 retail locations, which include specialty, mass, and online.
  
 The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 26, 2005. In October 2008, the Company acquired the assets of NDS Nutritional Products, Inc., a Nebraska corporation, and moved those assets into its wholly owned subsidiary NDS Nutrition Products, Inc., a Florida corporation (“NDS”). The Company’s NDS Products are sold through NDS and the iSatori Products are sold through iSatori, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
  
 On September 30, 2015, the Company consummated the Merger contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated May 18, 2015 (the “Merger Agreement”), among the Company, ISFL Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub“), and iSatori, pursuant to which iSatori merged with and into Merger Sub, with iSatori surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger was approved by iSatori shareholders at a special meeting held on September 29, 2015 and became effective on October 1, 2015.

  Recent Developments
  
  Merchant Agreement and Repayment of U.S. Bank Notes
  
 In December 2017, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, NDS and iSatori (together, the “Subsidiaries”), entered into a Merchant Agreement (the “Merchant Agreement”) with Compass Bank, d/b/a Commercial Billing Service (“Compass”). Under the terms of the Merchant Agreement, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions to funding, the Subsidiaries agreed to sell to Compass, and Compass agreed to purchase from the Subsidiaries, certain accounts owing from customers of such Subsidiaries, including GNC. All amounts due under the terms of the Merchant Agreement, totaling up to $5.0 million, are guaranteed by the Company under the terms of a Continuing Guarantee.
  
 On January 22, 2018, the Subsidiaries sold to Compass accounts receivable under the Merchant Agreement aggregating approximately $2.0 million, the proceeds from which were used to pay U.S. Bank N.A. (“USB”) all principal and accrued interest due and owing USB under the terms of certain promissory notes previously issued to USB (the “Notes”). As a result of such payment, together with a payment of approximately $360,000 from existing cash resources, the Notes, together with all other instruments and agreements executed by the Company and USB providing for the extension of credit by USB to the Company and the Subsidiaries, or otherwise, have terminated, and are of no further force and effect.
  
  Industry Overview
  
                 We compete principally in the nutrition industry. The Nutrition Business Journal categorizes the industry in the following segments:
  
  ●
  Natural & Organic Foods (products such as cereals, milk, non-dairy beverages and frozen meals);

 
  ●
  Functional Foods (products with added ingredients or fortification specifically for health or performance purposes);

 
  ●
  Natural & Organic Personal Care and Household Products; and


  ●
 Supplements (products focused on sports nutrition and weight management).

 
     Management believes that the following factors drive growth in the nutrition industry:
  
  ●
  The general public’s awareness and understanding of the connection between diet and health;

 
  ●
  The aging population in the Company’s markets who tend to use more nutritional supplements as they age;

 
  ●
  Increasing healthcare costs and the consequential trend toward preventative medicine and non-traditional medicines; and

 
  ●
  Product introductions in response to new scientific studies.

  Manufacturing, Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
  
 All of the Company’s products are manufactured by pre-selected FDA-regulated contract manufacturers. The Company utilizes third-party manufacturers within the United States and Canada to provide its finished products. Each contract manufacturer is required by the Company to abide by current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) to ensure quality and consistency, and to manufacture its products according to the Company’s strict specifications, and nearly all our contract manufacturers are certified through a governing body such as the NPA (“Natural Products Association”) or NSF International. In most cases, contract manufacturers purchase the raw materials based on the Company’s specifications; however, from time to time, the Company will license particular raw material ingredients and supply its own source to the manufacturer. Once produced, in addition to in-house testing performed by the contract manufacturer, the Company may also perform independent analysis and testing. The contract manufacturer either ships the finished product to one of our fulfillment centers, or directly to our distributors. The Company has implemented vendor qualification programs for all of its suppliers and manufacturers, including analytical testing of purchased products. As part of the vendor program, the Company also periodically inspects vendors’ facilities to monitor quality control and assurance procedures.
Product Reformulations and New Product Identification
  
 From time to time we reformulate existing products to address market developments and trends, and to respond to customer requests. We also continually expand our product line through the development of new products. New product ideas are derived from a number of sources, including internally, trade publications, scientific and health journals, consultants, distributors, and other third parties. Prior to reformulating existing products or introducing new products, we investigate product formulations as they relate to regulatory compliance and other issues. We introduced a total of 50 new products during the year ended December 31, 2017, which included eight completely new products, and 42 product reformulations and flavor extensions. We anticipate launching a similar number of new, but fewer reformulated products during 2018 across all brands.
  
 Management continually assesses and analyzes developing market trends to detect and proactively address what they believe are areas of unmet or growing demand that represent an opportunity for the Company and, where deemed appropriate, attempts to introduce new products and/or packaging solutions in direct response to meet that demand.
  
  Sales, Marketing and Distribution
  
  NDS Products
  
 NDS Products are sold through more than 900 GNC franchise locations located throughout the United States. The Company also currently distributes NDS Products to approximately 900 GNC international franchise locations in more than 15 foreign countries. On May 1, 2014, the Company transitioned the majority of its distribution of NDS Products to GNC’s centralized distribution platform for all NDS Products, excluding protein, which transitioned in mid-September 2014. Prior to the change, the majority of the Company’s revenue was realized upon direct shipment of NDS Products to individual franchise locations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, virtually all sales of NDS Products were attributable to sales through GNC’s centralized distribution platform.
  
 Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to expand sales of NDS Products to additional GNC franchise locations both domestically and internationally, as well as to develop a broader retail presence for our Core Active Nutrition Products and for continued expansion of our Metis Nutrition brand during 2018. The domestic franchise market remains a strong business and the core of our operations. Management is excited to continue to work collaboratively with the franchisees to build on our established track records of growth and innovation.
  
  iSatori Products
  
 iSatori Products are distributed directly to consumers through its websites and a proprietary online direct marketing system, as well as through wholesalers, specialty, online-only, grocery, convenience, drug and mass-market distribution channels. iSatori products are currently sold in over 25,000 retail locations. iSatori creates marketing, promotion, and packaging devices in its efforts to drive demand for its products through its established retail distribution.

 In some cases, iSatori utilizes independent brokers, who work in conjunction with iSatori’s experienced sales employees and management to oversee the grocery, drug and mass market channels. iSatori sells its products to mass-market merchandisers either directly or through distributors of nutritional supplement products. Major distributor, grocery, drug, convenience, club and mass-market customers are and/or have included: Albertsons, Amazon, Bally’s Total Fitness, BodyBuilding.com, Costco, CVS, Drugstore.com, Europa Sports, GNC, Kroger, Rite Aid, Super Value, 24 Hour Fitness, 7-Eleven, Vitamin Shoppe, Vitamin World, Walgreens and Wal-Mart.
  
 iSatori’s core strategy is to build brands within its channels of distribution that are appropriate for each product brand and to develop increased brand awareness and strong brand recognition among consumers seeking products with a reputation for quality and innovation. iSatori has utilized social media campaigns, coupons, print, radio, online and television advertising, plus cooperative and other incentive programs to build consumer awareness and generate trial and repeat purchases to drive sales revenue. Marketing and sales groups regularly review the media mix for its effectiveness in creating consumer demand and the highest return on investment dollars.
  
 In addition, iSatori’s conventional distribution marketing and its proprietary internet marketing strategy are designed to increase awareness of proprietary brands and drive targeted traffic to iSatori’s websites to make purchases. Through iSatori’s online marketing system, its network affiliates use a multi-channel approach, which includes search engine marketing, email campaigns, banner advertisements and additional affiliate programs to acquire new customers and retain a repeatable customer base.
  
  Product Returns
  
 We currently have a 30-day product return policy for NDS Products, which allows for a 100% sales price refund, less a 20% restocking fee, for the return of unopened and undamaged products purchased from us online through one of our websites. Product sold to GNC may be returned from store shelves or the distribution center in the event the product is damaged, short dated, expired or recalled. GNC maintains a customer satisfaction program that allows customers to return product to the store for credit or refund. Subject to certain terms and restrictions, GNC may require reimbursement from vendors for unsaleable returned product through either direct payment or credit against a future invoice. We also support a product return policy for iSatori Products, whereby customers can return product for credit or refund. Historically, with a few noted exceptions, product returns have been immaterial. However, despite the best efforts of management, product returns can and do occur from time to time and can be material.
 Competition
  
 The nutrition industry is highly competitive, and the Company competes with many companies engaged in the nutritional supplement industry. The Company also competes with companies who sell products similar to the Company’s products online. Many of the Company’s competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources than our own. The Company seeks to differentiate its products and marketing from its competitors based on product quality, benefits, and functional ingredients. Patent and trademark applications that cover new formulas and embody new technologies are, and will be, pursued whenever possible. While we cannot assure that such measures will block competitive products, we believe our continued emphasis on innovation and new product development targeted at the needs of the consumer will enable the Company to effectively compete in the marketplace.
 Regulatory Matters
  
 Our business is subject to varying degrees of regulation by a number of government authorities in the U.S., including the Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Various agencies of the states and localities in which we operate and in which our products are sold also regulate our business, such as the California Department of Health Services, Food and Drug Branch. The areas of our business that these and other authorities regulate include, among others:
  
  ●
  product claims and advertising;

 
  ●
  product labels;

 
  ●
  product ingredients; and

 
  ●
  how we manufacture, package, distribute, import, export, sell, and store our products.

 The FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, storage, labeling, promotion, distribution and sale of vitamins and other nutritional supplements in the U.S., while the FTC regulates marketing and advertising claims. In August 2007, a new rule issued by the FDA went into effect requiring companies that manufacture, package, label, distribute or hold nutritional supplements to meet cGMPs to ensure such products are of the quality specified and are properly packaged and labeled. We are committed to meeting or exceeding the standards set by the FDA and believe we are currently operating within the FDA mandated cGMPs.
  
 The FDA also regulates the labeling and marketing of dietary supplements and nutritional products, including the following:
  
  ●
  the identification of dietary supplements or nutritional products and their nutrition and ingredient labeling;

 
  ●
  requirements related to the wording used for claims about nutrients, health claims, and statements of nutritional support;

 
  ●
  labeling requirements for dietary supplements or nutritional products for which “high potency” and “antioxidant” claims are made;

 
  ●
  notification procedures for statements on dietary supplements or nutritional products; and

 
  ●
  premarket notification procedures for new dietary ingredients in nutritional supplements.

 
 The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (“DSHEA”) revised the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) concerning the composition and labeling of dietary supplements, and defined dietary supplements to include vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids and other dietary substances used to supplement diets. DSHEA generally provides a regulatory framework to help ensure safe, quality dietary supplements and the dissemination of accurate information about such products. The FDA is generally prohibited from regulating active ingredients in dietary supplements as drugs unless product claims, such as claims that a product may heal, mitigate, cure or prevent an illness, disease or malady, trigger drug status.
  
 DSHEA also permits statements of nutritional support to be included in labeling for nutritional supplements without FDA premarket approval. These statements must be submitted to the FDA within 30 days of marketing and must bear a label disclosure that includes the following: “This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.” These statements may describe a benefit related to a nutrient deficiency disease, the role of a nutrient or nutritional ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans, the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, or the general well-being from consumption of a nutrient or dietary ingredient, but may not expressly or implicitly represent that a nutritional supplement will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent a disease. An entity that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess scientific evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. If the FDA determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a disease claim for a food product, or if the FDA determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific data or is false or misleading, we will be prevented from using the claim. 
  
 In addition, DSHEA provides that so-called “third-party literature,” for example a reprint of a peer-reviewed scientific publication linking a particular nutritional ingredient with health benefits, may be used in connection with the sale of a nutritional supplement to consumers without the literature being subject to regulation as labeling. Such literature must not be false or misleading; the literature may not promote a particular manufacturer or brand of nutritional supplement; the literature must present a balanced view of the available scientific information on the nutritional supplement; if displayed in an establishment, the literature must be physically separate from the nutritional supplement; and the literature may not have appended to it any information by sticker or any other method. If the literature fails to satisfy each of these requirements, we may be prevented from disseminating it with our products, and any dissemination could subject our products to regulatory action as an illegal drug. Moreover, any written or verbal representation by us that would associate a nutrient in a product that we sell with an effect on a disease will be deemed evidence of intent to sell the product as an unapproved new drug, a violation of the FDCA.

 In December 2006, the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act (“DSNDCPA”) was passed, which further revised the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Under the act, manufacturers, packers or distributors whose name appears on the product label of a dietary supplement or nonprescription drug are required to include contact information on the product label for consumers to use in reporting adverse events associated with the product’s use and are required to notify the FDA of any serious adverse event report within 15 business days of receiving such report. Events reported to the FDA would not be considered an admission from a company that its product caused or contributed to the reported event. We are committed to meeting or exceeding the requirements of the DSNDCPA.
  
 We are also subject to a variety of other regulations in the U.S., including those relating to bioterrorism, taxes, labor and employment, import and export, the environment, and intellectual property. All of these regulations require significant financial and operational resources to ensure compliance, and we cannot assure that we will always be in compliance despite our best efforts to do so.
  
 Our operations outside the U.S. are similarly regulated by various agencies and entities in the countries in which we operate and in which our products are sold. The regulations of these countries may conflict with those in the U.S. and may vary from country to country. The sale of our products in certain European countries is subject to the rules and regulations of the European Union, which may be interpreted differently among the countries within the European Union. In other markets outside the U.S., we may be required to obtain approvals, licenses or certifications from a country’s ministry of health or comparable agency before we begin operations or the marketing of products in that country. Approvals or licenses may be conditioned on the reformulation of our products for a particular market or may be unavailable for certain products or product ingredients. These regulations may limit our ability to enter certain markets outside the U.S. Similar to the costs of regulatory compliance in the U.S., foreign regulations require significant financial and operational resources to ensure compliance, and we cannot assure that we will always be in compliance despite our best efforts to do so. Our failure to maintain regulatory compliance within and outside the U.S. could impact our ability to sell our products, and thus, materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
  
  Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Rights
  
 The Company regards intellectual property, including its trademarks, service marks, website URLs (domains) and other proprietary rights, as valuable assets and part of their revered brand equity. The Company believes that protecting such intellectual property is crucial to its business strategy. The Company pursues registration of the registrable trademarks, service marks and patents, associated with its key products in the United States, Canada, Europe and other places it distributes its products.
  
 The Company formulates its products using proprietary ingredient formulations, flavorings and delivery systems. To further protect its product formulations and flavors, the Company enters into agreements with manufacturers that provide exclusivity to certain products formulations and delivery technologies. When appropriate, the Company will seek to protect its research and development efforts by filing patent applications for proprietary product technologies or ingredient combinations. We have abandoned or not pursued efforts to register certain other patents and marks identifying other items in our product line for various reasons, including the inability of some names to qualify for registration or patent applications to qualify for patent protection, and due to our abandonment of certain such products. All trademark registrations are protected for a period of ten years and then are renewable thereafter if still in use.
  
  Employees
  
 We had 28 full-time employees (23 for NDS and five for iSatori) as of December 31, 2017. We consider our employee relations to be good. In addition to the above, the Company retains consultants for certain services on an as needed basis.
 Environmental Regulation
  
 Our business does not require us to comply with any particular environmental regulations.
