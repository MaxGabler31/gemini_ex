1.2                               THE CORPORATION AND ACQUISITION OF CTGH
 
Pacific Vegas Global Strategies, Inc. (the Company or PVGS), formerly known as Goaltimer International, Inc., was incorporated in Colorado on December 19, 1990. Prior to the acquisition of Cyber Technology Group Holdings Ltd. (CTGH), the Company entered into and operated a business of development and sales of time and personal management products. The Company had discontinued such business and become a non-operating public shell since 1994, and remained as a shell company with its only activities of accruing loan interest on notes payable and looking for a merger candidate.
 
On November 20, 2002, the Company entered into an agreement for share exchange with CTGH under the laws of Colorado. Pursuant to the share exchange agreement, and subject to its stockholders approval, the Company was to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity shares of CTGH, in exchange for 60,000,000 new shares of common stock of the Company. This transaction was approved by the stockholders of the Company at the special meeting of stockholders held on December 12, 2002.
 
The closing of the transaction was scheduled to take place on December 22, 2002 subsequently. The 60,000,000 new shares of common stock were therefore issued on December 22, 2002 as scheduled. However, the transaction was delayed and eventually closed on January 8, 2003, upon which control of the Company passed to the stockholders of CTGH, and CTGH became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
CTGH was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands in June 2000, operated as an investment holding company, holding 100% of the capital stock of Pacific Vegas Development Ltd. (PVD).
 
PVD was incorporated in Samoa in April 2000, operated as an IT company, engaged in a business of system development and technical supporting services for e-business, especially e-gaming related business, whilst holding 100% of the equity shares of Pacific Vegas International Ltd. (PVI).
 
PVI was incorporated in the Commonwealth of Dominica in April 2000, established and operated as an international gaming company, conducting an offshore business of international sportsbook by way of telecommunications and the Internet, under an International Gaming License granted by the government of the Commonwealth of Dominica.
 
As the Company was a non-operating public shell before its acquisition of CTGH, the nature of this acquisition was defined and treated as a capital transaction or recapitalization in substance, rather than a business combination. The acquisition did not result in any purchase accounting adjustments or creation of goodwill.

1.3                               BUSINESS OPERATIONS
 
Upon completion of the reorganization with CTGH in January 2003, CTGH became the operating entity of the Company to conduct business operations. The Company adopted CTGHs business of international sportsbook as its principal business and operated such business, through CTGH and its subsidiaries, from the Commonwealth of Dominica by way of telecommunications and the Internet, under an International Gaming License granted by the government of the Commonwealth of Dominica, until December 6, 2004, when the Board of Directors of the Company resolved to cease the operations of such business due to the significant financial losses resulted from such business.
 
Revenue from operations of sportsbook business was the only revenue source for the Company during the last fifteen years. The Company recorded a total revenue of US$1.70 million for the fiscal year 2003, and a total revenue of US$0.03 million for the fiscal year 2004. No revenue was recorded for the fiscal years 2005 through 2018 since the operations of sportsbook business were ceased and then discontinued.
 
The operations of sportsbook business resulted in significant financial losses for the Company, particularly for the fiscal year 2004. The Company incurred a net loss of US$0.39 million for the fiscal year 2003, and a net loss of US$2.35 million for the fiscal year 2004.
 
Our annual report on Form 10-KSB for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 presented a detailed analysis of the factors that caused the adverse results of our operations of the sportsbook business.
 
There was no business other than the aforementioned sportsbook business operated by the Company since 2003.
 
1.4                               DISPOSITION OF CTGH
 
In light of the significant financial losses resulted from the sportsbook business and the factors that caused such adverse results of operations, effective as of December 6, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Company resolved to cease the operations of sportsbook business, as an immediate remedial action to prevent further losses.
 
Having reviewed the financial position and re-evaluated the business structure of the Company, the Board of Directors further decided to terminate the sportsbook business and dispose of CTGH. On July 8, 2005, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Agreement) with an independent third party (the Buyer), pursuant to which, and subject to its stockholders approval, the Company was to sell its entire 100% equity interest in CTGH through disposition of all equity shares of CTGH for a consideration of US$125,000 in cash together with a non-cash settlement that the Buyer was to assume and pay all liabilities of CTGH as shown in the consolidated balance sheet of CTGH as at June 30, 2005 and to cancel and release the Company from its liabilities due to CTGH in the amount of US$549,288 or such other amount not exceeding US$549,288 as may be amended at the closing of the transaction. This Agreement was approved by our stockholders at the special meeting of stockholders held on October 14, 2005, and the transaction was subsequently executed and closed on November 18, 2005.
 
Details of this transaction were disclosed in the Companys earlier reports on Form 8-K, Form 10-QSB and definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC dated July 11, August 15, August 26, and November 18, 2005, respectively.
 
In accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-40 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Company reported CTGH as a discontinued operation in 2005, and the audited financial results for the fiscal year 2004 had been restated and presented in the consolidated financial statements on the same basis accordingly.
 
1.5                               CURRENT STATUS
