ITEM 1. BUSINESS
History
 
 Blockchain Industries, Inc. (“BCII”, the “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) was originally formed on September 15, 1995 as Interactive Processing, Inc. under the laws of the State of Nevada to market high-tech consumer electronics through television home-shopping networks, retail stores, catalog companies and their website remotecontrols.com. In March 1999, the Company changed its name to Worldtradeshow.com, Inc. (“WTS”). In April 1999, the Company acquired intellectual property rights to a database from Chaiisai Tora, Inc., an unaffiliated third party, and significantly changed its business plan to develop tradeshow software and market both physical and virtual tradeshow space through the Company's website.
 
 The Company’s business involved the operation of Hotels.com.vn, tour companies and restaurants, to sell the WTS Discount Card in Vietnam in order to serve as an online vehicle for Vietnamese companies to promote themselves, using the largest travel and tourism online website in, as well as being recognized as the official travel/tourism website of, Vietnam.
 
 On March 26, 2007, the Company acquired assets from Business.com.vn, a Vietnamese company, which assets consisted of a database of 300,000 Vietnamese companies, marketing software, trademarks and intellectual property, with the intention of developing a directory of companies. The plan included offering such companies opportunities to market themselves through domain registration, website development, and online marketing expertise to help these Vietnamese companies market themselves directly and/or on the Company’s BVNI web portal. In June 2007, the Company changed its name to Business.vn, Inc.
 
 From October 2008 through early 2016, the Company’s operations were limited due to a lack of capital resources. However, during this time, the Hotel.vn website was still operational. On May 15, 2016, the Company was placed under the control of a Receiver in Nevada’s Eighth Judicial District (the “Receiver”). From May 15, 2016 through March 22, 2017, while under the control of the Receiver, the Company continued to incur expenses to maintain its corporate existence as a public company. On November 18, 2016, the Company changed its name to Omni Global Technologies, Inc. and on May 23, 2017, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with JOJ Holdings, LLC (“JOJ”), pursuant to which JOJ: (i) purchased 40,000,000 restricted shares of common stock, $0.001 par value (the “Control Shares”); (ii) assumed the liabilities of a judgement creditor in the amount of approximately $25,000; and (iii) paid the Receiver $150,000 for the Receiver’s and other Company expenses (the “Share Purchase Agreement”). Additionally, and concurrent with the execution of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Receiver resigned, and Olivia Funk was appointed as the sole officer and director of the Company.
 
 On November 13, 2017, the Company filed Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the State of Nevada for the purpose of changing its name from Omni Global Technologies, Inc. to Blockchain Industries, Inc. to more accurately reflect its new business strategy. Since that time the Company has taken steps to become a next generation blockchain-powered, financial technology and advisory company. In this regard the Company’s business can be divided into the following four verticals:
 
 ● Investment Management
 
 ● Digital Asset Advisory Services
 
 ● Media and Education
 
 ● Digital Asset Mining

     Recent Developments
     On January 16, 2019, the Company entered into a letter of intent (the “Letter of Intent”) with BTHMB Holdings Pte. Ltd., a Singapore corporation (“BTHMB”). The Letter of Intent provides that the Company and BTHMB will negotiate the terms of a certain stock purchase whereby the Company shall sell that certain number of shares of it’s Common Stock (the “Sale Shares”) representing a super majority of the Company’s outstanding shares.
     Although this Letter of Intent expired on February 7, 2019, the Company and BTHMB have continued to negotiate the parameters of a potential business transaction in good faith, including but not limited to a merger transaction and other strategic partnerships within the various business verticals we plan to pursue.
 
 Our Business
 
 Our initial plan to develop a blockchain business with a new domain called hotelsinvietnam.net has been discontinued. We intend to target and acquire or build a broad portfolio of Digital Assets within our four business verticals. The Company’s mission is to provide products and services related to Digital Assets. We intend to target and acquire or build a broad portfolio of Digital Assets by building an ecosystem within the Digital Asset industry. Our ecosystem will include four major verticals: investment management, digital asset advisory services, media & education, and digital asset mining. In the future, we also plan to establish auxiliary businesses such as OTC (over-the-counter) trading, exchanges.
 1. Investment Management
 
 During the 2018 Fiscal Year through January 2019, the Company was planning to pursue investment management of blockchain-related assets as one of its core lines of business. We were seeking to provide services to traditional investment management companies, with a focus on blockchain technology. Our thesis in the business focused on new or traditional businesses that have already integrated or have reasonably viable plans to implement blockchain-technology into their business model.
     This business vertical was to be operated through our wholly-owned subsidiary, BCI Investment Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. We believed we would eventually begin the process to register this entity with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Company expected to seed the funds with its own capital and subsequently obtain outside investment capital from non-related third parties and expected to generate revenues by charging a combination of management and performance fees. Up until January 2019 we were in the process of establishing the following three alternative investment vehicles in furtherance of the foregoing:
 

 
   
5


  
 

   a. 
  Blockchain Industries Global Opportunity Fund


 It was contemplated that this fund would have sought to invest in exchange-traded tokens. Our strategy was twofold (i) algorithmic/high- frequency trading (“HFT”); and (ii) small/mid-cap fundamental trading. The HFT component would have sought to capture inefficiencies in market structure and provide liquidity to other market participants. The small/mid-cap fundamental strategy would seek to invest tokens that are outside of the top fifteen high market-capitalization tokens.

   b. 
  Blockchain Industries ICO Access Fund


 This fund sought to invest in early-stage Initial Coin Offerings (“ICO”), Security Token Offerings (“STO”) and private token sales. Utilizing our business network, we believed that we could differentiate against competitors to access deals that are unavailable to most investors and often at favorable terms. We expected significant overlap between our portfolio companies and our advisory clients.

   c. 
  Blockchain Industries Venture Fund


 This fund sought to invest in early-stage equity of blockchain and blockchain related companies. and will make equity investments in fiat-generating businesses in the blockchain space (e.g. exchanges, trading tool providers) and in companies developing blockchain-native technologies who may or may not have token offerings.
 
 As of January 2019, the Company has delayed its plans related to the Investment Management segment of its business. We chose to pause this segment because the Company does not have sufficient capital to maintain or build this business and the Company has focused its efforts on pursuing a business transaction with BTHMB as well as its advisory services vertical.
 
  2. 
 Advisory Services


 We believe that incorporating a blockchain into a traditional business model can add value not only from raising capital, but also transparency and efficiency. Our advisory service seeks to offer clients a complete solution including, but not limited to, architecting their token structure and issuance, crypto-economic design (assessing economic benefits of utilizing a blockchain-based token), technology/engineering, consulting, generating whitepapers, software development, development services to build blockchains or stablecoins and to assist with cyber security of blockchains, marketing and eventually making capital introductions via the use of a broker-dealer, which we are actively seeking. In addition, we aim to help our clients establish a meaningful understanding of blockchain technologies and services, establish partnerships and provide them with media exposure and informative literature. The Company is remunerated through a combination of upfront compensation (generally in U.S. Dollars), equity and/or tokens of the companies we advise. Although we intended to form or purchase a broker-dealer to help us maintain compliance and execute our business in the emerging token capital markets, we have abandoned active efforts to actively seek partnerships and coverage from existing broker-dealers.
     The Company continues to examine a wide array of potential companies that we believe will benefit from our consulting and other services related to potential ICO or STO transactions, and we will continue to try and contract with customers that we feel have a high-value utility in their underlying business model.

  3. 
  Media and Education


 Blockchain technology is fairly nascent and most educated investors are unaware of its broad use cases or how the technology works. Education is going to be a large part of the technology’s success and we believe there is a market to develop educational and other content for professionals, students, investors or other potential users of the technology.
 
 We have developed a business to help promote the awareness, growth, and education of blockchain technology and Digital Assets. Our goals are (1) to invest in, partner with or acquire media streams, news outlets or other methods of content distribution focused on the marketing of blockchain technologies and Digital Asset economies and their impact on the future and (2) partner with educational institutions to help train the next generation of blockchain developers. We have begun executing our goal to hold conferences around the world with strategic partners that attract key sponsors and influential speakers from the blockchain industry, local governments and educators on an ongoing basis. In 2018 we held two conferences, one in San Juan, Puerto Rico and the other in Tokyo, which focused on bringing together regulators, investors, technologists, media and other blockchain stakeholders to discuss the evolution of blockchain technology and its impact on industries such as government, finance, technology and more. The conference in San Juan Puerto Rico was held under the name “Blockchain Unbound”, for which we submitted an application in April 2018 to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) for trademark registration. Our application was received by and is currently pending before the USPTO. The application has been initially refused due to a prior filed application by another applicant seeking registration of the trademark “Unbound” to be used in manner that the examiner considers to be confusingly similar to ours. As of the date of this report there has been no resolution of the prior filed application, we will determine whether to continue our pursuit of the trademark registration.

 We promote our brand primarily through the use of our network, bringing on speakers that are influencers, which we feel will draw crowds. We do anticipate a small amount of advertising on social media or news websites. The Company was responsible for organizing media, security, entertainment, and booking guest speakers and travel for certain guests.
  
 As of the date of this report the Company has delayed its plans related to the Media and Education segment of its business. We chose to pause this segment because the Company does not have sufficient capital to maintain or build this business.

  4. 
 Digital Asset Mining


 “Mining” for Digital Assets is the process by which a node on a blockchain network is rewarded with the coin or token from that blockchain for providing resources to the blockchain. For example, Bitcoin, a popular cryptocurrency, uses a proof-of-work method to add blocks to the blockchain. Specialized computers solve complex mathematical problems to validate transaction and post them to the blockchain. For successfully solving the problems, and providing power to the network, the computer is rewarded with coins or tokens inherent to that blockchain. There are other methods of validation and verification such as, proof-of-stake and proof-of-space, hybrid methods, among others. During the 2018 Fiscal Year through January 2019, it was the intention of BCII to build a data center that houses the specialized computers or other resources on behalf of clients. We intended to rent space or resources (power, bandwidth, etc.) to client for a fee.

 The Company intended to set up mining facilities with access to inexpensive energy and lease these facilities to experienced digital asset miners. The Company previously intended to enter into an agreement to purchase land and build a tier-2 data center in upstate New York. The Company entered into several agreements with independent contractors to assess the design, feasibility and profitability of this endeavor. The Company incurred costs for the project which was paid to services professionals for their work in connection therewith. As of April 30, 2018, the Company has withdrawn from that opportunity. The Company was focused on a potential site in Virginia Beach, VA and was negotiating with a local economic development agency for the development of the site. The Company sought additional capital to proceed with this potential investment, however it was unable to procure funding and abandoned the project.
  
 As of January 2019, the Company has abandoned its plans related to the Digital Asset Mining segment of its business due to insufficient capital to fund the development and maintenance of this business.

  Future Plans

 
 A digital asset exchange is an area that the Company has invested time and capital but has not yet pursued to a point where they have been able to generate revenues or believe they will generate any significant revenues in the immediate future. The Company is actively seeking to build this business unit or merge it with an existing business units at the appropriate time. No guarantee can be made that we will continue to pursue these opportunities or that we will have the capital in order to do so in a timely manner or at all.
 
   a. 
  Merchant Banking


 During the 2018 Fiscal Year through January 2019, the Company had explored developing merchant banking operations to (1) help broker off-exchange transactions in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other Digital Assets, (2) perform Digital Asset custody service, (3) provide financing for ICO’s or STO’s, acquisitions or other services related to traditional merchant banking, but related to the Digital Asset industry. We believed there was great potential in this business as Digital Asset exchanges are fragmented and cannot provide enough liquidity, and many of the transactions are not up to standards in terms of regulatory requirements. The Company planned to leverage its reputation to offer a global, scalable solution to this market.

 As of January 2019, the Company has abandoned its plans related to Merchant Banking segment due to insufficient capital to fund the development and maintenance of the business.

   b. 
  Digital Asset Exchange


 The Company previously undertook due diligence in connection with potentially establishing its own Digital Asset exchange. We planned to partner with high- frequency trading and technology specialists to develop a global exchange with the intention of uniting the fragmented liquidity pools on the hundreds of Digital Asset exchanges. We believe that this platform would be able to provide the robust infrastructure and market depth to support institutional investors. There will be regulatory agencies that will have oversight on this business, which will require us to apply and successfully receive, in order to operate legally in the jurisdictions where we plan to operate and where our clients are located. We will be required to adhere to strict standards of security and compliance, which will make this business costly and difficult to operate. The success of our Digital Asset Exchange would require partnerships with key vendors, experienced technical and financial expertise, regulatory and compliance in various jurisdictions, all of which will require significant capital.
 
 As of January 2019, the Company has delayed its plans related to the Digital Asset Exchange segment due to insufficient capital to fund the development and maintenance of this business, although the Company is actively pursuing several partnerships, including with BTHMB, which may aid in the development of this segment in the future.

 Intellectual Property
  
 In April 2018, we applied for a trademark on “Blockchain Unbound”. Our application was received by and is currently pending before the USPTO. The application has been initially refused due to a prior filed application by another applicant seeking registration of the trademark “Unbound” to be used in manner that the examiner considers to be confusingly similar to ours. As of the date of this report there has been no resolution of the prior filed application, we will determine whether to continue our pursuit of the trademark registration and how to best proceed.

 The Company will assess all possible patents, trademarks or other intellectual property in all business opportunities. Intellectual property rights may be required to be successful and maintain competitive advantages. However, at this time the Company does not maintain any Patents or Trademarks and does not have any Patents pending. We currently rely on our trade secrets and know-how. As our business expands we expect to make significant investments in technology, some of which we expect to be proprietary and will necessitate the filing of patents and or trademarks.
 
 Growth Strategy
 
 BCII will utilize its network to seek and contract with clients looking for advisory services. Initially, we feel starting with white papers and engineering of blockchain architecture will be our first opportunities. Although the Company is focusing most of its efforts on closing a business transaction with BTHMB, including a potential merger among other strategic partnerships, we have made some effort into looking for these opportunities. If the Company is able to obtain required capital we may continue to seek a relationship with a broker-dealer, we expect to grow the business with capital raising and utilize an expanding network to offer additional services.
       We believe there are opportunities to expand the Blockchain Unbound brand, which includes our conferences, to other media sources, developing content not only from our conferences. Until the Company is able to fund this business, we do not expect to hold conferences in the interim although we will continue to build relationships to maintain our ability to host a conference. We may also create free or subscription-based platforms to specialized written or video content from industry experts, drawing attention to the Digital Asset progress and current events.

 In addition to foregoing, the Company will continue to explore other synergistic business opportunities related to blockchain technologies and Digital Assets. The analysis of business opportunities, as it relates to our market verticals, will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the officers and directors of the Company. In particular, we are keenly focused on acquiring, through share purchase agreements, businesses in the blockchain space or have an obvious blockchain use-case that (1) currently or will, in the near-term, generate positive cash flow; and (2) integrates well into our ecosystem. In its efforts to analyze potential business opportunities, the Company will consider factors including, but not limited to, the list below:

  ● 
 potential for organic growth in revenue and cash flow, indicated by technology, anticipated market expansion or new products;

  ● 
 competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry verticals as well as within the industry as a whole;

  ● 
 strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment;

  ● 
 capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;

  ● 
 the cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials;

  ● 
 the extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced and incorporated into our ecosystem;

  ● 
 the accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items.


 In applying the foregoing criteria, none of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and decide based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Additionally, management will investigate an entity to engage a potential acquisition through reviewing available financial statements, interviewing a potential acquisition’s primary vendors and customers as well as financial advisors.
 
 Industry Overview
 
 Our business model now focuses on blockchain technology. A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger. As opposed to a centralized database whereby an entire database, or full copies of that database, remains in the control of one person or entity stored on a computer that is controlled or owned by that same person or entity, a blockchain ledger typically has partial copies of itself across various nodes, or computers, in the network. Each new block requires a method of consensus between nodes of the network in order for the block to post to the ledger and become permanent. There are various methods being developed for executing a consensus. Currently, the most popular blockchain is Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, which uses a mathematical problem to be solved before it can be confirmed and added to its blockchain.

 Cryptocurrencies are a medium of exchange that are transacted through and recorded on a blockchain and therefore within our scope of business. The term “mining” is used to define a process which the blockchain consensus is formed. The Bitcoin consensus process, for example, entails solving complex mathematical problems using custom designed computers. However, many more public and private blockchains are being developed with different algorithms or consensus models, which can use different hardware and methods for performing function of adding blocks to their blockchains. A fork is when the developers of a digital currency essentially create a second branch of that currency using the same basic code. Most of the time, a fork occurs after deliberation and discussion among the development team behind a virtual currency and the mining and (sometimes) investing communities. An airdrop is the delivery of a cryptocurrency to a certain group of investors. There may be unknown accounting issues with new assets delivered by airdrops and forks. There may also be loss of value from existing assets in the blockchain forks because market conditions do not find the fork advantageous.

  Digital Assets Value
 
 Cryptocurrencies are currencies that are not backed by a central bank or a national, supra-national or quasi-national organization and are not typically backed by hard assets or other credit. Cryptocurrencies are typically used as a medium of exchange, similar to fiat currencies like the U.S. Dollar. In addition to cryptocurrencies, there are other assets such as contracts or other information that reside on a blockchain that represent a form of ownership. Examples may include insurance contracts, deeds, wills, health data, or securities. Together with cryptocurrencies, these other assets, which also include virtual currencies, digital coins and tokens, and other blockchain assets, make up a class of assets called “Digital Assets”. The value of Digital Assets is determined by the value that various market participants place on them through their transactions, for example, via peer-to-peer transactions, e-commerce, or exchanges.
 Form Digital Assets
 
 Bitcoin is one form of a Digital Asset. Digital Assets are all electronic representations or claims on other assets, which is not much different than today. U.S. dollars may now be digital, deeds may now be digital, health records may now be digital or stored electronically, signatures are now capable of being digital and so on. The difference between today’s digitized assets and Digital Assets that BCII is focusing on revolves around the use of blockchain to maintain trust and increase efficiencies of currently centralized systems. U.S. Dollars are controlled by one entity, the Federal Reserve System (the “Fed”). The Fed is responsible for many aspects of the United States’ banking system such as (1) ensuring that all member banks do not double-spend any money, (2) settling transactions between member banks, (3) creating or destroying credit by setting reserve requirements, setting interest rate targets and entering into transactions that will increase or decrease the supply of U.S. Dollars. They do all of this digitally. The purpose of blockchain, specifically related to banking and the use of money, is to have a self-governing system that prevents double-spending of money, settling transactions, and manipulating the supply of money. The form of our assets, or proof of ownership of those assets, are digital today. Our goal is to simply seek business opportunities in the technology that is eliminating bureaucracy, “middle men”, and other inefficiencies that increase the costs of our world through the use of a database that is distributed on various nodes of a network, rather than centrally controls by one or a few entities or individuals. Storage of Digital Assets
 
 Bitcoin is called a cryptocurrency because it is used as a medium of exchange. People can trade Bitcoin on an exchange, similar to buying
 
 U.S. Dollars futures contracts on an exchange. People also use Bitcoin via e-commerce platforms such as Overstock.com, or smaller retailers that have integrations with wallets. Bitcoin, like most cryptocurrencies, are stored in a digital wallet, similar to a traditional bank account today, except the code behind the Bitcoin is not controlled by a central bank. A wallet that holds a Digital Asset can be stored in an online exchange like Coinbase, which is similar to Bank of America holding your U.S. Dollars. This is called “hot storage”. Digital Assets can also be held in “cold storage”, which is similar to having your money in a safety deposit box. A cold storage wallet is a wallet on a separate physical device such as a cell phone, a USB drive or a special encrypted device to hold Digital Assets.
  Blockchain Advisory Market
     The blockchain advisory market size is difficult to predict. However, Reuters published an article on March 5, 2019, stating that blockchain in the financial technology market alone will be worth $6.7 billion by 2023. A MarketWatch article published June 19, 2019, states that the total blockchain market will reach $23.3 billion by 2023. By comparison, the MarketWatch article notes the blockchain market size was $1.2 billion in 2018. Within these market sizes, we feel advisory will play a large role to educate existing business and technologies on the role blockchain can play in improving their operations, potentially by improving security, trust, efficiency and lowering costs.
     In the first half of 2019, there seems to be a popularity of “stablecoins”, which are pegged to an existing, more stable asset, most notably fiat currencies such as the U.S. Dollar. Companies such as J.P. Morgan Chase and Facebook have announced they are launching stablecoins, which could overtake the market with their ability to influence through their existing networks, platforms and associations. A proposed advantage of stablecoins is the ability to reduce the time of transaction settlement in traditional payment networks.

 Competition
 
 Our industry is extremely new and subject to rapid change and constant innovation. We face significant competition, including from companies that have entered this space much earlier than us and are better capitalized, with vertically integrated business models. Larger companies such as IBM already provide blockchain advisory services. The “Big 4” public accounting firms, such as Pricewaterhouse Coopers and Ernst and young also provide blockchain advisory services. Our focus will need to be small to medium-sized companies that cannot afford the costs of the large blockchain advisors.

 Our Advisory Services business has competition from several places. The demand for Digital Asset developers is high and has become costly, so we would be competing with engineering firms for talent. In addition, as more traditional financial institutions may see the benefit in raising capital for clients in the Digital Asset industry, we may be forced to compete with larger, established institutions with long, successful track records.
 
 Our competitors may be larger than us, have more access to capital and have lower operating costs than we do.

 Regulation
  
 As a result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010 (Dodd-Frank), the adoption of implementing regulations by the federal regulatory agencies, and other recent regulatory reforms, we have experienced significant changes in the laws and regulations that apply to us, how we are regulated, and regulatory expectations in the areas of compliance, risk management, corporate governance, operations, capital, and liquidity.
 
 Typically, we do not have to obtain permits to operate conferences. The hotels at which such events occur obtain any required permits and cover fire safety and occupancy matters as part of the rental agreement. Crowd control varies by location and is either provided by the hotel’s personnel or by a third-party security service. We have hired security teams for each of our conferences thus far. We utilize tax counsel to determine if a Physical Establishment is formed for any international conferences. If Physical Establishment is determined to be formed, we may be subject to additional regulations and income or value-added taxes in the international jurisdiction where we hold the conference.
 
 The Digital Asset markets have grown rapidly in both popularity and market size. These markets are local, national and international and include an ever-broadening range of products and participants. The SEC, and other governmental agencies around the world, are evaluating these markets and are likely to institute new rules and regulations within this market to protect investors and such regulations could result in the restriction of the acquisition, ownership, holding, selling, use or trading of our common stock.
  
 Potentially available business opportunities may occur at various stages of development, all of which may be expected to make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult, complex, time-consuming and costly. Capital limitations always limit a company’s ability to pursue some potential opportunities. Investments in this emerging space are more speculative in nature than traditional industries. Every reasonable attempt to conduct proper due diligence will be made, but we can make no warranties or guarantees about the outcomes.
 
 Employees
 
 As of June 20, 2019, we employ a total of 2 full-time employees, of whom all are based in the United States. As of June 20, 2019, we rely on 1 part-time independent contractor that is based in North America.

 We believe that our future success depends on attracting and retaining highly skilled personnel. We may be unable to attract and retain high-caliber employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit. We have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our employee relations to be good.
