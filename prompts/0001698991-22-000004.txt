ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We believe we are the leading distributed gaming operator in the United States on an Adjusted EBITDA basis, and a preferred partner for local business owners in the Illinois market. Our business consists of the installation, maintenance and operation of gaming terminals, redemption devices that disburse winnings and contain automated teller machine (“ATM”) functionality, and other amusement devices in authorized non-casino locations such as restaurants, bars, taverns, convenience stores, liquor stores, truck stops, and grocery stores, which are referred to collectively as “licensed establishments.” We also operate stand-alone ATMs in gaming and non-gaming locations. Accel has been licensed by the Illinois Gaming Board (the “IGB”) since 2012 and holds a license from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (the “PA Board”). In July 2020, the Georgia Lottery Corporation (the “GLC”) approved one of our consolidated subsidiaries as a licensed operator, or a Master Licensee, which allows us to install and operate coin operated amusement machines for commercial use by the public for play throughout the State of Georgia. On December 30, 2021, one of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries acquired amusement operations in Iowa and registered with the Iowa Department of Inspection (the “IDIA”) to conduct operations in Iowa.
Our gaming-as-a-service platform provides local businesses with a turnkey, capital efficient gaming solution. We own all of our gaming equipment and manage the entire operating process for our licensed establishment partners. We also offer our licensed establishment partners gaming solutions that appeal to players who patronize those businesses. We devote significant resources to licensed establishment partner retention, and seek to provide prompt, personalized player service and support, which we believe is unparalleled among other distributed gaming operators. Dedicated relationship managers assist licensed establishment partners with regulatory applications and compliance onboarding, train licensed establishment partners on how to engage with players and potential players, monitor individual gaming areas for compliance, cleanliness and comfort and recommend potential changes to improve both player gaming experience and overall revenue for each licensed establishment. We also provide weekly gaming revenue reports to our licensed establishment partners and analyze and compare gaming results within individual licensed establishment partners. This information is used to determine an optimal selection of games, layouts and other ideas to generate foot traffic for our licensed establishment partners with the goal of generating increased gaming revenue. Further, our in-house collections and security personnel provide highly secure cash transportation and vault management services. Our best-in-class technicians ensure minimal downtime through proactive service and routine maintenance. As a result, Accel’s voluntary contract renewal rate was approximately 99% for the three-year period ended December 31, 2021.
In addition to our gaming business, we also install, operate and service redemption devices that have ATM functionality, stand-alone ATMs and amusement devices, including jukeboxes, dartboards, pool tables, pinball machines and other related entertainment equipment. These operations provide a complementary source of lead generation for our gaming business by offering a “one-stop” source of additional equipment for its licensed establishment partners.
Our Industry
We operate within the U.S. distributed gaming industry, which consists of the installation and service of slot machines at non-casino licensed establishments. Generally, a gaming terminal or slot machine is any electronic video game machine that, upon insertion of cash, electronic cards or vouchers, or any combination thereof, is available to play or simulate the play of a video game, including but not limited to video poker and slots, and utilizes a video display and microprocessors in which players may receive free games or credits that can be redeemed for cash or merchandise. Distributed gaming is currently legal in Illinois, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and West Virginia. Other states such as Georgia, Iowa and Nebraska have a similar but separately regulated amusement machine market. We believe that the distributed gaming industry is supported by generally favorable trends, including an increasing number of states contemplating approving gaming to increase tax revenues, broader acceptance in the U.S. of gaming generally, including online and digital gaming, an aging population that appreciates the convenience of gaming entertainment close to home, expected resilience through economic downturns and attractive revenue and return on invested capital profiles when compared to traditional gaming venues, such as casinos. We 
believe that the industry has witnessed both a growing player base and increased variety of higher quality game profiles available through gaming terminals.
Our operations are based primarily in Illinois. We have been licensed as a terminal operator in Illinois under the Illinois Gaming Act since 2012. We were one of the first terminal operators licensed in Illinois. The Illinois distributed gaming industry has grown significantly since 2012, with 7,836 licensed establishments operating a total of 41,826 video gaming terminals (“VGTs”) as of December 31, 2021, according to Scientific Games International’s terminal operator portal and the Video Gaming Revenue Reports published by the IGB. According to the IGB, approximately 1,390 out of approximately 1,496 municipalities in Illinois permit the operation of gaming terminals. Gaming terminals in Illinois can be played in licensed bars, restaurants, gaming cafes, truck stops, fraternal organizations, veterans’ organizations, and other retail establishments, including some convenience stores, in areas accessible only to players who are 21 years of age or older. Gaming revenue in Illinois from gaming terminals generates significant tax revenue. The Illinois state legislature has increased applicable marginal tax rates on gaming from 30% to 33% effective July 1, 2019 and from 33% to 34% effective July 1, 2020. While the increase in gaming tax rates negatively impacted the distributed gaming industry, other legislative changes, such as an increase in the number of permitted gaming terminals at a given location, an increase in maximum wager limits and maximum win payouts are driving overall video gaming revenue upward.
The IGB generally oversees gambling and video gaming operations in the state of Illinois. The IGB is authorized to issue licenses to distributed gaming operators and has broad disciplinary authority over Illinois’s distributed gaming industry which includes the power to fine operators and licensed establishments for non-compliance with IGB regulations. As enforcement efforts and incidents of discipline among licensees increase, fine amounts for non-compliance have also increased. While the IGB has licensed a significant number of new video gaming establishments in recent years, it has also experienced an increase in its application backlog. In addition, Illinois’ governor is empowered to appoint board members to the IGB and select its administrator for the IGB to ultimately approve. Not only do new appointments have the potential to change the composition of the IGB, they can impact current rules, regulations, policies and agendas of the IGB, which may result in increased enforcement measures or further delays in licensing new establishments. The IGB dictates the maximum bet, maximum win, and approves payout percentages for games played on gaming terminals which are required by regulation to exceed 80%. Generally, suppliers have designed gaming terminals to include between approximately 10 and 40 games. In 2021, payout percentages for gaming terminals across Illinois averaged approximately 92%, according to the Video Gaming Revenue Reports published by the IGB. Accel’s payouts range from 88% to 94%, with an average of 92%. Additionally, Illinois legislation has increased the maximum number of gaming terminals that may be operated at a given licensed establishment from five to six, with certain qualifying truck stop licensed establishments allowed to operate up to ten gaming terminals. This legislation has also increased the maximum wager that may be placed on a gaming terminal from $2.00 to $4.00 and the maximum win from a single play from $500 to $1,199. All gaming terminals are monitored and controlled by the IGB through a central communications system. The IGB established minimum standards that licensed establishment partner contracts must meet, including limiting the length of contracts entered into after February 2, 2018 to a maximum of eight years with no automatic renewals.
We have made substantial investments in regulatory training and compliance for our staff and licensed establishment partners. Accel has designed and implemented systems and controls that facilitate compliance with applicable regulatory requirements in Illinois and is working on implementing similar systems and controls in Georgia, Iowa, and for the anticipated start of live gaming in Pennsylvania.
The operation of coin-operated amusement machines, or COAMs, in Georgia has been regulated by the GLC since April 2013. Class B COAMs provide skill-based games with winnings paid in points that may be redeemed for noncash merchandise, prizes, toys, gift certificates, or novelties. The most common type of establishment licensees are convenience stores. Licensed establishments are limited to a maximum of nine machines, unless a municipality specifically limits licensed establishments to a maximum of six machines. In addition, any local governing authority may vote to remove coin operated amusement machines from its jurisdiction upon 60 days’ advance notice. In 2020, we acquired Tom’s Amusement Company, Inc., a Southeastern U.S. amusement operator and Master Licensee (“Tom’s Amusements”) in the state of Georgia. The acquisition of Tom’s Amusements added 11 Georgia COAM Class B locations to the Accel portfolio, as well as a total of 65 Class B COAM terminals. On May 20, 
2021, the Company acquired Island Games, Inc. (“Island”), a southern Georgia amusement operator and Master Licensee in the state of Georgia. The acquisition of Island added 30 COAM Class B locations to the Accel portfolio, including a total of 89 Class B COAM terminals. 
On November 18, 2020, we became a licensed Terminal Operator in Pennsylvania under the Pennsylvania Race Horse Development and Gaming Act, although Accel has not yet commenced any gaming operations in Pennsylvania as of December 31, 2021. In November 2017, Pennsylvania’s Governor signed the Pennsylvania Gaming Act. The law authorized, among other forms of gaming, gaming terminals at qualified truck stops. To qualify for gaming, a truck stop must meet requirements that are similar to those in Illinois. Accel has a binding agreement to install gaming terminals with a partner truck stop establishment in Pennsylvania that has received a conditional license from the PA Board. Accel is also in discussions with other potential partners who have not yet applied for licensure. The Company hopes to commence gaming operations in Pennsylvania in 2022. We believe the current total potential number of qualified trucks stops to host gaming terminals in Pennsylvania is approximately 100-150 truck stop establishments, although municipalities are able to individually opt out from authorizing distributed gaming. These establishments consist of corporate truck stops and individual and corporate convenience stores that meet current regulatory requirements for gaming terminal installation. 
 On December 30, 2021, one of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries became a registered distributor in the State of Iowa, which is required to operate amusement concessions in the state. Amusement concessions are regulated by the IDIA under Title III, Chapter 99B of the Iowa Administrative Code. Amusement concessions fall into two broad categories: games of chance and games of skill. Games of chance means a game in which the result is determined by chance. An example of a game of chance is when a player aligns objects or balls in a prescribed pattern in order to win. Certain establishments such as bars, taverns, and restaurants with a Class B or Class C liquor license are permitted to operate up to four electrical or mechanical games of chance. The total number of permitted electrical and mechanical games of chance allowed in Iowa is capped at 6,928 devices. Games of skill means a game in which the result is determined by the player to do a task, such as directing or throwing objects to designated areas or targets, or by shooting a gun or rifle. The Company operates both games of chance and games of skill as well as other amusement equipment and ATMs in Iowa. 
In addition, our marketing and sales efforts are subject to the rules and regulations of the regulatory gaming bodies and municipal laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we do business, including rules promulgated by the IGB, GLC, the PA Board, IDIA, and local municipalities in Illinois. These rules generally require sales agent registration, include prohibitions related to inducements and restrict certain advertising and promotional activities.
We may also enter states other than Pennsylvania that currently permit or may consider permitting gaming terminals. Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Virginia, and Mississippi have proposed legislation permitting gaming terminals or other forms of gaming in the past. Other states, counties or municipalities facing tax revenue shortfalls or other fiscal pressure may adopt similar measures. 
Accel’s Core Strengths
We believe that the following competitive strengths contribute to our industry leading position:
Gaming-as-a-service platform. When compared with traditional gaming businesses such as casinos, Accel believes its platform benefits from the following advantages:
•“business-to-business” model secured by long-term, exclusive contracts that are typically renewed, allowing for predictable, highly recurring revenue streams with low churn;
•operating a scalable business in fast-growing gaming segments that are primarily served by fragmented, sub-scale providers;
•data reporting solutions and analytics, offering insight and advice to help licensed establishment partners maximize revenues and ultimately grow their businesses;
•state-of-the-art technology-enabled slot machines from leading manufacturers who provide the most captivating titles in slots entertainment;
•comparatively low capital expenses and a comparatively asset-light operating model, in each case, when compared to casinos, which typically provide significantly higher capital-intensive offerings such as hotel accommodations, restaurants and stage-based entertainment;
•highly localized footprint that provides more access to gaming and convenience for consumers, as compared to regional casinos that market to players who may live up to several hours away and are thus prone to disruption of their feeder markets; and
•strong marketing, legal, compliance, cash management, financial and technical support systems, all of which remain in-house to boost efficiency and enhance the ability to serve as a premier gaming-as-a-service provider.
Strong relationships with licensed establishment partners. Accel has prioritized establishing strong, lasting relationships with its licensed establishment partners since its inception. Accel dedicates a relationship manager to each of its licensed establishment partners, who, with support from other personnel, oversees every aspect of partner relationship management and retention. Accel prides itself on providing prompt, reliable service and education, all of which helps to increase referral marketing by its partners. Accel’s relationship managers’ efforts to provide value-added services to their licensed establishment partners result in consistent pre-renewals long before contracts expire and are a key element of our competitive differentiation.
Proven track record in executing and integrating acquisitions. Accel continuously evaluates strategic acquisition opportunities. Accel has a successful track record of identifying, acquiring and integrating competitive operators at favorable terms. Since becoming a licensed terminal operator in 2012, Accel has acquired 15 operator companies, adding approximately 1,000 licensed establishments to our total portfolio of 2,584 licensed establishment partners as of December 31, 2021. Accel believes that its industry reputation, scale, proven track record of driving revenue synergies, and public acquisition currency enhances its ability to acquire other operators or licensed establishments on favorable terms and makes Accel a preferred partner of choice.
Diversified revenue base with limited churn. Accel believes that gaming regulations in Illinois facilitate a low revenue concentration per licensed establishment partner, and that its low-limit slots are more resilient to economic downturn as consumers typically continue to engage in locally convenient, lower cost forms of entertainment in such circumstances. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Accel’s best-performing licensed establishment accounted for approximately $3.0 million, or less than 1% of gross revenue, its top 20 licensed establishments represented only 5% of gross revenue and Accel’s licensed establishment partners each contributed an average of approximately $0.3 million of gross revenue. Accel’s voluntary contract renewal rate was approximately 99% for the three-year period ended December 31, 2021. While Accel experiences business disruptions each year due to business failures, IGB-imposed shutdowns, or natural disasters affecting licensed establishment partners, many of these sites reopen in subsequent years under new owners, and Accel believes it is best-positioned to reengage with those establishments as new licensed establishment partners because of its reputation and leading market position. Accel’s gaming terminals are geographically diversified across the state of Illinois, limiting systemic risk due to local weather patterns or regional economic downturns. We believe that Accel’s recent expansion into Georgia and Iowa and future expansion into other states may further help to diversify its portfolio.
Deep industry and vendor relationships. Accel’s leading market position has led to strong relationships within its industry and with equipment suppliers. Accel has successfully integrated multiple other operators and believes this successful roll-up strategy positions it well with potential additional local operators who could benefit from Accel’s gaming-as-a-service platform. In addition, Accel’s industry leadership permits it to seek and obtain favorable pricing and supply of key gaming machines. Due to its ability to procure machines and parts easily, Accel is able to rotate machines quickly to licensed establishment partners where they are most needed across its operating footprint. This results in longer, more effective usage and greater lifetimes for Accel’s gaming terminals.
Management team. Accel’s management team has many years of experience and industry knowledge. Accel’s President, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder, Andy Rubenstein, has led the Company since its inception in 2009, and its other officers have approximately 60 years of combined gaming industry experience. Accel believes that its industry-leading management team has a reputation for integrity and compelling customer service.
Company culture and training. Accel believes that it is an employer of choice for talented candidates. Accel’s corporate culture is strong and Accel invests heavily in employees’ success, including devoting significant resources to training and other development programs. Accel also experiences relatively low levels of employee turnover.
Accel’s Growth Opportunities
Accel’s key growth strategies include its plans to:
Maintain competitive advantage in Illinois and increase gaming terminal share. Accel believes that there is substantial potential for further growth in Illinois. Accel has been successful in the past in signing competitors’ licensed establishments and has identified prospects for engagement after current contracts with other partners expire. In particular, Accel sees opportunities for expansion in key local markets, such as Springfield, Bloomington and Decatur, where its gaming terminal share is below its share in other regions. Accel also strives to further optimize revenues for gaming terminals it currently operates through refined data analysis, marketing and other initiatives. Accel seeks to increase distribution possibilities through corporate partners who operate multiple licensed establishments such as chain stores. Accel believes that these corporate businesses tend to favor larger operators who have substantial compliance infrastructures in addition to leading service capabilities. While such licensed establishments have been “second movers” in choosing to adopt video gaming, partnering with reputable operators such as Accel could render deployment of gaming terminals more attractive. Accel’s leadership position also creates an opportunity for it to take advantage of legislative changes in Illinois such as an increased number of allowed gaming terminals per establishment, higher bet limits, higher win amounts, and larger jackpots. Additionally, Accel may realize the benefits of potential municipal ordinance changes that would permit its business to operate in new municipalities.
Grow our operations in Georgia and Iowa. The operation of coin-operated amusement machines in Georgia has been regulated by the Georgia Lottery Corporation since April 2013. Games are skill-based with winnings paid in points that may be redeemed for noncash merchandise, prizes, toys, gift certificates, or novelties. The most common type of establishment licensees are convenience stores. Licensed establishments are limited to a maximum of nine machines, unless a municipality specifically limits licensed establishments to a maximum of six machines. In 2020, we acquired Tom’s Amusements which added 11 Georgia COAM Class B locations to the Accel portfolio, as well as a total of 65 Class B COAM terminals. On May 20, 2021, the Company acquired Island, a southern Georgia amusement operator and Master Licensee in the state of Georgia. The acquisition of Island added 30 Georgia COAM Class B locations to the Accel portfolio, including a total of 89 Class B COAM terminals. 
On December 30, 2021, one of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries became a registered distributor in the State of Iowa, which is required to operate amusement concessions in the state. Amusement concessions are regulated by the IDIA under Title III, Chapter 99B of the Iowa Administrative Code. Amusement concessions fall into two broad categories: games of chance and games of skill. Games of chance means a game in which the result is determined by chance. An example of a game of chance is when a player aligns objects or balls in a prescribed pattern in order to win. Certain establishments such as bars, taverns, and restaurants with a Class B or Class C liquor license are permitted to operate up to four electrical or mechanical games of chance. The total number of permitted electrical and mechanical games of chance allowed in Iowa is capped at 6,928 devices. Games of skill means a game in which the result is determined by the player to do a task, such as directing or throwing objects to designated areas or targets, or by shooting a gun or rifle. The Company operates both games of chance and games of skill as well as other amusement equipment and ATMs in Iowa. 
Expand operations into Pennsylvania. In November 2017, Pennsylvania’s Governor signed the Pennsylvania Gaming Act. The law authorized, among other forms of gaming, gaming terminals at qualified truck stops. Accel estimates that the total potential number of qualified truck stops to host gaming terminals in Pennsylvania is approximately 100-150 truck stops as of December 31, 2021, although municipalities are able to individually opt out from authorizing distributed gaming. Accel believes this market opportunity is attractive and has obtained a terminal operator license from the PA Board. Accel is also in discussions with other potential location partners who have not yet applied for licensure. Accel believes that Pennsylvania is a natural choice for its expansion outside of Illinois when compared to other states due to industry similarities with Illinois. See “— Accel’s Industry” for more information. 
Establish Player Rewards Program to further drive growth. As part of its gaming-as-a-service suite of offerings, Accel has considered offering a Player Rewards Program for players. The anticipated terms of the program will provide for players to accumulate points each time they use Accel’s products and may provide points that can be redeemed for rewards. Accel believes this program will result in increased brand loyalty from licensed establishment partners by rewarding players for using Accel’s gaming terminals. This opt-in program is expected to allow data analysis with respect to each player, location and machine, which will in turn permit Accel to better assess performance and serve its partners. Although player rewards programs are not specifically prohibited in Illinois, applicable regulations have not been enacted, and the IGB has not approved any player rewards programs for any terminal operator. Accel has not applied to the IGB to establish any such program, but expects to apply in the event of applicable regulation enactment.
Expand operations to other states. Various states and other jurisdictions have proposed legislation permitting gaming terminals or other forms of gaming in the past. These states include Indiana, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina and Virginia. Accel may also choose to expand operations through strategic acquisitions or otherwise in other, more mature gaming jurisdictions where gaming terminals are currently legal, such as Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, South Dakota and West Virginia. Accel may attempt to seek approval to operate in additional jurisdictions that authorize video gaming. Accel believes it would be a favored entrant into any such markets given its track record of success and compliance.
Expand ancillary service offerings to licensed establishments. While distributing and servicing amusement devices such as jukeboxes, dartboards, pool tables, pinball machines and other ancillary equipment, such as redemption devices and stand-alone ATMs, is not the primary focus of its business, Accel believes that these services provide a key point for ongoing customer contact and enhances its image as a “one-stop shop” for entertainment devices. Accel has observed that licensed establishment partners appreciate these services and continue to rely on Accel to provide them. Providing these services can also serve as a point of initial contact with potential partners who may decide to avail themselves later of Accel’s primary gaming services. As a result, Accel intends to continue prioritizing the installation of these devices and equipment.
Business Model and Capabilities
Accel provides a full suite of services and capabilities to enhance its business. These include:
Sales team that drives the initial acquisition of licensed establishment partners. Accel has a dedicated internal sales team that drives sourcing of new licensed establishment partners. Accel also uses external independent sales agents. When seeking to sign a new licensed establishment partner, Accel’s marketing team employs a data-driven sales process to identify and nurture leads using a variety of digital and traditional strategies to drive organic gaming partnerships and preference. Accel’s marketing team uses email, social media, blogs, search engine optimization, paid search and display advertising to create a robust pipeline of leads. Sales teams are incentivized based on a competitive commission-based structure, which has driven performance. Accel believes that it can continue to attract talented sales employees.
Dedicated on-boarding process that works with new licensed establishments to provide quick access to gaming terminals and other equipment. Accel engages with licensed establishment partners through every step of the gaming terminal installation process. This process begins with providing assistance with preparation and submission of a license application to the applicable gaming regulatory board and educating each licensed establishment partner on legal and regulatory topics to minimize compliance issues. Accel assists in the design and construction of gaming areas in licensed establishments, including advising with respect to Illinois Video Gaming Act requirements that restrict access to persons 
under 21 years of age. Accel then delivers gaming terminals to the licensed establishment partner after receipt of the proper state and municipal licenses, which typically takes between two and six months from submission to receipt of approval to operate gaming terminals.
Relationship management team that offers value to licensed establishment partners. Each of Accel’s licensed establishment partners has a dedicated relationship manager who works with the licensed establishment partner in maximizing revenue, based upon the licensed establishment’s unique characteristics. Compliance support is offered to assist the licensed establishment partner with understanding gaming regulations, optimizing services that analyze video gaming data against established benchmarks to assess and improve performance, offering marketing advice ranging from traditional advertising and signage to social media advice, providing industry tracking and reporting measured against Accel’s industry data, and delivering ongoing training for licensed establishment partner staff.
Digital and data analytics team that helps licensed establishment partners capture gaming revenue. Accel’s digital and data analytics team studies the gaming terminal market and licensed establishment partner performance to provide insight and advice to maximize gaming revenue. The team actively monitors machine optimization, service analytics, video game popularity analytics, marketing and player behavior to identify new opportunities and provide insights to maximize gaming revenues. Typical suggestions might involve adding new games, switching machines, adding machines or changing machine location within a licensed establishment. The digital and data analytics team also seeks to improve the quality of customer service and satisfaction by monitoring service calls to identify trends and solutions with the goal of optimizing response time to decrease periods of machine inoperability.
Dedicated legal and compliance function that assists licensed establishment partners to remain in regulatory compliance. Accel’s legal and compliance team provides support and resources related to licensed establishment regulatory compliance, which includes sending compliance reminders and industry updates to licensed establishment partners on a regular basis. It does not dispense legal advice to licensed establishment partners, but may recommend that licensed establishment partners obtain legal counsel in certain instances. In addition, the legal and compliance team participates in lobbying measures, which includes working with gaming regulators and trade associations to encourage legislation and regulation which may be favorable to the distributed gaming industry. Accel also regularly works with regulators in other states as they explore the legalization of gaming terminals.
Strong relationships with equipment manufacturers to provide top-flight machines and software that help attract players. Accel partners and has entered into purchase agreements with many industry-leading manufacturers of gaming terminals. Accel benefits from favorable pricing and other terms with respect to its supplier partners. Accel believes that by providing world-class premium equipment, it can assist licensed establishment partners in securing competitive advantages. By using high-quality equipment, Accel aims to limit downtime and help maximize revenue and player retention.
Cash collection and analytics. Accel offers cash collection and analytics services at multiple strategic locations across Illinois to help ensure secure, fast and accurate collection of revenue for licensed establishment partners. Additionally, Accel’s data team provides information to its treasury department enabling it to deliver efficient, secure, and optimized collection services. These cash collection locations function as a key point of contact for licensed establishment partners, and Accel believes that this service differentiates it from most of its competitors.
Marketing services that aid in player awareness and gameplay. In addition to its business-to-business focus, Accel’s marketing team uses a variety of player marketing strategies to drive player preference, loyalty, and increase play at Accel locations. Player marketing initiatives include a dedicated player website, AEPlayer.com, a statewide player loyalty program (AEPlayer Rewards), including a tablet-based in-location entry option as well as a mobile app, player email and text messaging communications, indoor and outdoor signage, cooperative location advertising and other media to increase awareness and encourage gameplay. Accel believes that these initiatives increase Accel’s branding at each location. Accel believes that it has the most extensive and accomplished marketing team in the Illinois gaming terminal segment.
Best-in-class technicians who assist licensed establishment partners in the event of any mechanical or software issues with the devices Accel provides. Accel leverages technology and data-driven algorithms to enable a 24/7 call center to direct its service technicians. These technicians serve to prevent and solve technical issues with gaming terminals at licensed establishment partners in a timely manner. Accel’s service tracking process begins when a licensed establishment partner identifies an issue at their licensed establishment and contacts the service center. As of December 31, 2021, more than 15% of service issues are resolved by the call center directly without the need to dispatch any technician. In the event a technician is required, 96% of customer service issues are addressed on a first-time technician dispatch, with an average response time of approximately 80 minutes. Replacement parts for gaming terminals, if required, are sourced from Accel’s offices and warehouses located across the state. Accel uses system analytics across its gaming-as-a-service platform to keep track of parts used and, if necessary, order new parts for delivery to various warehouses. 
Sports betting. Accel believes it is well positioned to participate in the fast-growing sports betting segment. While Accel expects to remain focused on gaming in the near future, it has not applied for a sports betting license, but it may consider doing so in the future.
Licensed Establishments and VGTs
As of December 31, 2021, Accel operates 13,639 VGTs in 2,584 licensed establishments in the state of Illinois. Licensed establishments typically include bars, restaurants, gaming cafes, truck stops, fraternal organizations, veterans’ organizations, and other retail establishments.
Accel enters into long-term exclusive location and gaming terminal use agreements with its licensed establishment partners, or master exclusive gaming terminal use agreements with licensed establishment partners who have several licensed establishments. Under those agreements, Accel has the exclusive right to place gaming terminals and redemption devices in such licensed establishments. Once proper licenses are received, Accel experiences minimal delay related to the installation of gaming terminals in those licensed establishments. As of December 31, 2021, the average remaining term on Accel’s agreements is 6.8 years. In addition, Accel’s voluntary contract renewal rate for the three-year period ended December 31, 2021 was approximately 99%.
Under these agreements, Accel is responsible for providing hardware and related software, accounting and reporting functions as required by the Illinois Video Gaming Act and/or Pennsylvania Gaming Act, and placement of devices such as stand-alone ATMs and redemption devices at the discretion of the licensed establishment.
Under IGB regulations, tax and administrative fees in Illinois are required to be split evenly between gaming terminal operators and licensed establishments. Accordingly, Accel shares the responsibility with its licensed establishment partners of the payment of a 34% tax on gross gaming revenue, with such tax increased from 33% beginning on July 1, 2020. In accordance with IGB regulations, Accel further shares the responsibility of a 0.8513% administrative fee with its licensed establishment partners, payable to Scientific Games International, the company that maintains the central communications system to which all gaming terminals across Illinois are connected. The remaining after-tax profits from a video gaming terminal, 50% shall be paid to Accel and 50% shall be paid to the licensed establishment in accordance with Illinois state law. Accel typically remits the amount to licensed establishment partners on a weekly basis. Accel’s agreements with licensed establishment partners are typically not subject to termination rights by licensed establishment partners in the event of a sale or relocation of the licensed establishments during the term of the agreements, though termination may occur upon closure of the business or if the licensed establishment partner chooses to terminate at the end of a term.
In addition, Accel has a very limited number of revenue-share agreements with other licensed terminal operators in Illinois, which provide splitting gross gaming revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue shared with other terminal operators accounted for less than 1% of gross revenue.
Suppliers
Accel installs cutting-edge software and multi-game gaming terminals, at each licensed establishment, from leading manufacturers such as Scientific Games International, WMS (owned by Scientific Games International), IGT, Bally (owned by Scientific Games International), Aristocrat and Novomatic. Under agreements with these manufacturers, Accel is able to provide 28 different types of gaming terminal models and 242 different games to licensed establishment partners. Accel believes its efforts to procure gaming terminals from various sources better enables it to meet the needs of licensed establishment partners and players.
Accel purchases gaming terminals in upright and slant varieties. Games include different varieties of slots, poker, and keno games. Accel routinely meets with existing and potential manufacturers in the market to discuss performance, service trends, and feedback from licensed establishment partners and players. Accel purchases gaming terminals from certain suppliers under master purchase agreements and purchase orders. Under these master purchase agreements with certain suppliers, pricing is determined by purchase commitments made for delivery over defined periods. Accel generally pays its suppliers within 90 days after the date of invoice.
Accel also purchases redemption devices, amusement devices and stand-alone ATMs from reputable suppliers such as NRT, Touch Tunes, Arachnid, and Diamond.
Competition
Accel competes on the basis of the responsiveness of its services to players, and the popularity, content, features, quality, functionality, accuracy and reliability of its products. Accel generally does not consider pricing to be a factor in its gaming terminal business as all minimum and maximum wagers are mandated by the IGB and all revenue splits with the licensed establishments are mandated by the IGB and by law. Accel believes most licensed establishments focus on player appeal, customer service and reputation when making their decisions to collaborate with terminal operators. In Illinois, Accel currently competes with 55 terminal operators that operate in 7,836 gaming establishments as of December 31, 2021. The top five terminal operators with which Accel principally competes are J&J Ventures Gaming, LLC, Gold Rush Amusements, Inc., Illinois Gaming Investors LLC, Gaming & Entertainment Management-Illinois LLC, and Midwest Electronics Gaming, LLC. Together with Accel, they operate in more than 82% of all licensed establishments in Illinois, and the top 10 terminal operators in Illinois operate in approximately 91% of all licensed establishments. Accel currently operates gaming terminals and/or amusement devices in 32% of all establishments licensed to operate gaming terminals in Illinois.
Accel faces particularly robust competition from other forms of gaming. The distributed gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants on both a local and national level, including casinos, Internet gaming, sports betting, sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos, horse racetracks (including those featuring slot machines and/or table games), fantasy sports, real money iGaming, and other forms of gaming. In addition, Internet-based lotteries, sweepstakes, and fantasy sports, and Internet-based or mobile-based gaming platforms, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and/or play casino games from home or in non-casino settings and could divert players from using Accel’s products in its licensed establishments. Even Internet wagering services that may be illegal under federal and state law but operate from overseas locations, may nevertheless sometimes be accessible to domestic gamblers and divert players from visiting licensed establishment partners to play on Accel’s gaming terminals.
The availability of other forms of gaming could increase substantially in the future. Voters and state legislatures may seek to supplement traditional sources of tax revenue by authorizing or expanding gaming. For example, on June 2, 2019, the Illinois legislature passed a significant gaming expansion bill authorizing the addition of more casinos to the state, including a casino in Chicago, permitting slot and table games at three horse racetracks, adding slot machines to two Illinois airports, and sports betting at a variety of approved establishments throughout the state. In addition, jurisdictions are considering or have already recently legalized, implemented and expanded gaming, and there are proposals across the country that would legalize Internet poker and other varieties of Internet gaming in a number of states and at the federal level. Pennsylvania enacted legislation allowing regulated online poker and casino-style games within the commonwealth and legalizing sports betting in casinos. Established gaming jurisdictions could also award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing gaming 
operations, including gaming terminals. While Accel believes it is well positioned to take advantage of certain of these opportunities, expansion of gaming in other jurisdictions, both legal and illegal, could further compete with its gaming terminals.
In addition to competition from other forms of gaming and entertainment and the expansion thereof, Accel’s business faces significant competition from suppliers and other terminal operators, stand-alone ATMs, jukeboxes, dartboards, pool tables, pinball machines and related entertainment machines. Accel’s operations also face competition from many forms of leisure and entertainment activities, including shopping, athletic events, television and movies, concerts, and travel.
Intellectual property
Accel owns or has rights to use the trademarks, service marks or trade names that it uses or will use in conjunction with the operation of its business. In the highly competitive gaming industry, trademarks, service marks, trade names and logos are important to the success of its business.
As of December 31, 2021, Accel owned 12 registered trademarks and 103 registered domain names. Accel also relies on software or technologies that it licenses from third parties. These licenses may not continue to be available to Accel on commercially reasonable terms in the future and as a result, Accel may be required to obtain substitute software or technologies.
Seasonality
Accel’s results of operations can fluctuate due to seasonal trends and other factors. For example, the gross revenue per machine per day is typically lower in the summer when players will typically spend less time indoors at licensed establishments, and higher in cold weather between February and April, when players will typically spend more time indoors. Holidays, vacation seasons and sporting events may also cause Accel’s results to fluctuate.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, Accel had approximately 900 employees. None of Accel’s employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Accel believes its current staffing levels to be adequate for its needs and operations, and that relations with employees are generally good.
