Item 1.    Business
Bloomin’ Brands, Inc. (“Bloomin’ Brands,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” and similar terms mean Bloomin’ Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries except where the context otherwise requires) is one of the largest casual dining restaurant companies in the world, with a portfolio of leading, differentiated restaurant concepts. We have four founder-inspired concepts: Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba’s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill and Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar. Our restaurant concepts range in price point and degree of formality from casual (Outback Steakhouse and Carrabba’s Italian Grill) to upscale casual (Bonefish Grill) and fine dining (Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar). OSI Restaurant Partners, LLC (“OSI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bloomin’ Brands, is our primary operating entity.
COVID-19 Pandemic Impact on Our Business
In March 2020, we temporarily closed all restaurant dining rooms to comply with state and local regulations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID-19”). In early May 2020, we began to reopen our restaurant dining rooms with limited seating capacity in compliance with state and local regulations. The temporary closure of our dining rooms and the limitations on seating capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significantly reduced traffic in our restaurants which negatively impacted our operating results during 2020.
During 2021, the recovery of in-restaurant dining continued as COVID-19 capacity restrictions were eased or eliminated. Though concerns over variants of COVID-19 impacted recovery, we continued to retain a significant portion of the incremental off-premises volume achieved while our dining rooms were closed last year.
MARKETS
As of December 26, 2021, we owned and operated 1,169 full-service restaurants and off-premises only kitchens and franchised 329 full-service restaurants and off-premises only kitchens across 47 states, Guam and 17 countries. 
Our Segments 
We consider our restaurant concepts and international markets to be operating segments, which reflects how we manage our business, review operating performance and allocate resources. We aggregate our operating segments into two reportable segments, U.S. and international. The U.S. segment includes all restaurants operating in the U.S. while restaurants operating outside the U.S. are included in the international segment. Following is a summary of reportable segments as of December 26, 2021:

REPORTABLE SEGMENT (1) | | CONCEPT | | GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION

International Segment
We have local management to support and grow restaurants in each of the countries where we have Company-owned operations. Our international operations are integrated with our corporate headquarters to leverage enterprise-wide capabilities, including marketing, finance, real estate, information technology, legal, human resources, supply chain management and productivity.
As of December 26, 2021, in our international segment, we owned and operated 156 full-service restaurants and off-premises only kitchens and franchised 172 full-service restaurants and off-premises only kitchens across 17 countries and Guam. See Item 2. Properties for disclosure of our international restaurant count by country and territory.
Outback Steakhouse - Our international Outback Steakhouse restaurants have a menu similar to our U.S. menu with additional variety to meet local taste preferences. In addition to the traditional Outback Special sirloin, a typical international menu may feature local beef cuts such as the Aussie Grilled Picanha in Brazil.
Carrabba’s Italian Grill (Abbraccio Cucina Italiana) - Abbraccio Cucina Italiana, our international Carrabba’s Italian Grill restaurant concept, offers a blend of traditional and modern Italian dishes. The menu varies, with additional pasta and pizza offerings, to account for local tastes and customs. Abbraccio Cucina Italiana also has a range of beverage options, including classically inspired cocktails and local favorites with an Italian twist. 
Restaurant Development
We utilize the ownership structure and market entry strategy that best fits the needs for a particular market, including Company-owned units and franchises, as determined by demand, cost structure and economic conditions.
U.S. Development - We opportunistically pursue unit growth across our concepts through existing geography fill-in and market expansion opportunities.
During 2021, we opened our first Outback Steakhouse utilizing a smaller-scaled “Joey” prototype. The Joey prototype was designed to increase return on investment through a reduced restaurant footprint with a more efficient layout. We plan to open additional Joey Outback Steakhouse restaurants during 2022. 
BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.

During 2021, we continued to test and develop our first fast-casual concept, Aussie Grill by Outback (“Aussie Grill”). Originally created for our international franchisees, Aussie Grill offers steak, burgers, chicken and salad with fast-casual convenience. After successfully launching Aussie Grill internationally, we added Company-owned locations in the U.S. and in May 2020 opened the first free standing restaurant. We opened two additional U.S. Aussie Grill restaurants during 2021 and additional locations are planned to open in 2022.
International Development - We continue to pursue international expansion opportunities, leveraging established equity and franchise markets in South America and Asia, and in strategically selected emerging and high-growth developed markets, with a focus on Brazil.
Off-Premises Only Expansion - Since 2019, our franchisee in South Korea has rolled out delivery-only kitchens, which are food preparation and cooking facilities that are not located in a traditional retail space and are limited to delivery-only. These kitchens allow for the expansion of our restaurant concepts into areas where traditional retail space is not available or cost prohibitive. As of December 26, 2021, there were 40 delivery-only kitchens operating in South Korea and 24 additional locations are planned to open in 2022.

Competition
The restaurant industry is highly competitive with a substantial number of restaurant operators that compete directly and indirectly with us in respect to price, service, location and food quality, and there are other well-established competitors with significant financial and other resources. There is also active competition for management personnel, attractive suitable real estate sites, supplies and restaurant employees. In addition, competition is influenced strongly by marketing and brand reputation. At an aggregate level, all major casual dining restaurants in markets in which we operate would be considered competitors of our concepts. We also face growing competition from the supermarket industry which offers expanded selections of prepared meals. In addition, improving product offerings and convenience options from quick service and fast-casual restaurants and the expansion of home delivery services, together with negative economic conditions, could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives than our restaurants. Internationally, we face increasing competition due to an increase in the number of casual dining restaurant options in the markets in which we operate.
REVENUE GENERATING ACTIVITIES
We generate our revenues from our Company-owned restaurants and through sales of franchise rights and ongoing royalties and other fees from our franchised restaurants.
Company-owned Restaurants - Company-owned restaurants are restaurants wholly-owned by us or in which we have a majority ownership. The results of operations of Company-owned restaurants are included in our consolidated operating results and the portion of income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests is eliminated in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
Historically, we paid royalties that ranged from 0.5% to 1.5% of U.S. sales on the majority of our Carrabba’s Italian Grill restaurants, pursuant to agreements we entered into with the Carrabba’s Italian Grill founders (“Carrabba’s Founders”). Each Carrabba’s Italian Grill restaurant located outside the U.S. paid a one-time lump sum fee to the Carrabba’s Founders in place of a continuing royalty fee. In August 2021, we entered into the Purchase and Sale of Royalty Payment Stream and Termination of Royalty Agreement (the “Royalty Termination Agreement”) with the Carrabba’s Founders, pursuant to which our obligation to pay future royalties and lump sum royalty fees on Carrabba’s Italian Grill (and Abbraccio) restaurants was terminated.

Average check per person (R$) | | | | | | | | | R$ | 50 | 

Delivery - During 2019, we completed the rollout of in-house delivery for substantially all Outback Steakhouse and the majority of Carrabba’s Italian Grill Company-owned restaurants and expanded our delivery platform through partnerships with leading national delivery services for our Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba’s Italian Grill and certain Bonefish Grill restaurants.
In March 2020, we pivoted to an off-premises only model in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While our dining rooms were closed in the U.S. we tripled our off-premises sales per restaurant, and since reopening our restaurant dining rooms in May 2020, have maintained strong retention of off-premises sales.
Unaffiliated Franchise Program - Our unaffiliated franchise agreements grant third parties rights to establish and operate a restaurant using one of our concepts. Franchised restaurants are required to be operated in accordance with the franchise agreement and in compliance with their respective concept’s standards and specifications. 
Under our franchise agreements, each franchisee is required to pay an initial franchise fee and monthly royalties based on a percentage of gross restaurant sales. Initial franchise fees for full-service restaurants are generally $40,000 for U.S. franchisees and range between $30,000 and $75,000 for international franchisees, depending on the market. Initial franchise fees for international delivery-only kitchens are generally $10,000. Some franchisees may also pay advertising and administration fees based on a percentage of gross restaurant sales. Following is a summary of royalty fee percentages based on our existing unaffiliated franchise agreements:

(as a % of gross Restaurant sales) | MONTHLY ROYALTY FEE PERCENTAGE
U.S. franchisees (1) | 3.50% - 5.75% 
International franchisees (2) | 2.00% - 5.00% 

_________________
(1)U.S. franchisees must also contribute a percentage of gross sales for national marketing programs and spend a certain percentage of gross sales on local advertising. For most U.S. franchisees, there is a maximum of 8.0% of gross restaurant sales for combined national marketing and local advertising.
(2)International franchisees must spend a certain percentage of gross sales on local advertising, which varies depending on the market.
On December 27, 2020, we entered into an agreement (the “Resolution Agreement”) with Cerca Trova Southwest Restaurant Group, LLC (d/b/a Out West Restaurant Group) and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Out West”), a franchisee of approximately 80 Outback Steakhouse restaurants in the western United States as of December 26, 2021. Under the terms of the agreement, advertising fees were reduced to 2.25% of gross sales until December 31, 2023 or upon the earlier occurrence of certain specified events, including the sale of all or substantially all of the assets or equity of Out West, bankruptcy or a liquidation event.
BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.

Out West also entered into a forbearance agreement with its lenders that, in conjunction with the Resolution Agreement which, among other things, provides for a pre-determined calculation of available monthly cash (“Available Cash”) that Out West may use to settle its obligations due to us and its lenders. Under the Resolution Agreement, if Out West is unable to satisfy monthly royalty or advertising fees with Available Cash, such amounts will be automatically deferred under the Resolution Agreement.
See Note 4 - Revenue Recognition of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the Resolution Agreement.
RESOURCES
Sourcing and Supply - We take a global approach to procurement and supply chain management, with our corporate team serving all U.S. and international concepts. In addition, we have dedicated supply chain management personnel for our Company-owned international operations in South America and Asia. The global supply chain management organization is responsible for all food and operating supply purchases as well as a large percentage of purchases of field and corporate services.
We address the end-to-end costs associated with the products and goods we purchase by utilizing a combination of global, regional and local suppliers to capture efficiencies and economies of scale. This “total cost of ownership” (“TCO”) approach focuses on the initial purchase price, coupled with the cost structure underlying the procurement and order fulfillment process. The TCO approach includes monitoring commodity markets and trends to execute product purchases at the most advantageous times. 
We have a distribution program that includes food, beverage, smallwares and packaging goods in all major markets. Where applicable, this program is managed by a custom distribution company that only provides products approved for our system. This customized relationship also enables our staff to effectively manage and prioritize our supply chain.
Beef represents the majority of purchased proteins. In 2021, we primarily purchased our U.S. beef raw materials from four beef suppliers and our Brazil beef raw materials from three beef suppliers. Due to the nature of our industry, we expect to continue purchasing a substantial amount of beef from a small number of suppliers. Other major commodity categories purchased include seafood, poultry, produce, dairy, bread, oils and pasta, and energy sources to operate our restaurants, such as natural gas and electricity. The cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation, changing weather patterns and conditions, climate change, and other supply and/or demand impacting events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical events, or other unforeseen circumstances. 
Serving safe and high quality food has always been our priority. We utilize both an internal food safety team responsible for supplier evaluations and external third parties who inspect supplier adherence and restaurant practices to monitor quality, food safety and product specifications. All of our restaurants implement best practices for food handling, monitoring and innovating to improve procedures. Our restaurant teams have many touch points to seek to ensure food safety, quality, and freshness through all phases of preparation.
We are committed to building long-term partnerships with suppliers who are dedicated to delivering safe, high quality ingredients in a sustainable way. All suppliers are required to comply with our Supplier Code of Ethics and we strive to source only products that are raised in a sustainable, ethical and humane manner. 
Information Systems - We leverage technology to support areas such as digital marketing and customer engagement, business analytics and decision support, restaurant operations and productivity initiatives related to optimizing our staffing, food waste management and supply chain efficiency. 
To drive customer engagement, we continue to invest in data and technology infrastructure, including brand websites, digital marketing, online ordering and mobile apps. To increase customer convenience, we are leveraging 
BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.

our online ordering infrastructure to facilitate expanded off-premises dining systems. Additionally, we developed systems to support our customer loyalty program with a focus on increasing traffic to our restaurants. In recent years, we have made investments in a global supply chain management system to improve inventory forecasting and replenishment in our restaurants, which helps us manage food quality and cost. We also continue to invest in a range of tools and infrastructure to support risk management and cyber security. 
Our integrated point-of-sale system allows us to transact business in our restaurants and communicate sales data through a secure corporate network to our enterprise resource planning system and data warehouse. Our Company-owned restaurants, and most of our franchised restaurants, are connected through a portal that provides our employees and franchise partners with access to business information and tools that allow them to collaborate, communicate, train and share information.
We maintain a robust system to ensure network security and safeguard against data loss. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional discussion of our cyber security measures.
Advertising and Marketing - We advertise through a diverse set of media channels including but not limited to national/spot television, radio, social media, search engines and other digital tactics. Our concepts have active public relations programs and also rely on national promotions, site visibility, local marketing, digital marketing, direct mail, billboards and point-of-sale materials to promote our restaurants. Recently, we increased our focus on data segmentation and personalization, customer relationship management and digital advertising to be more efficient and relevant with our advertising expenditures. Internationally, we have teams in our developed markets that engage local agencies to tailor advertising to each market and develop relevant and timely promotions based on local consumer demand. 
Our multi-branded loyalty program, Dine Rewards, is designed to drive incremental traffic and provide data for customer segmentation and personalization opportunities.
Restaurant Management - The Restaurant Managing Partner has primary responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the restaurant and is required to follow Company-established operating standards. Area Operating Partners for our casual dining concepts oversee restaurant operations and Restaurant Managing Partners within a specific region.
In addition to base salary, Area Operating Partners, Restaurant Managing Partners and Chef Partners generally receive performance-based bonuses for providing management and supervisory services to their restaurants, certain of which may be based on a percentage of their restaurants’ monthly operating results or cash flows and/or total controllable income.
Restaurant Managing Partners and Chef Partners in the U.S. may also participate in deferred compensation and other performance-based compensation programs. To fund deferred compensation arrangements, we may invest in corporate-owned life insurance policies, which are held within an irrevocable grantor or “rabbi” trust account for settlement of certain of our obligations under the deferred compensation plans. 
Many of our international Restaurant Managing Partners are given the option to purchase participation interests in the cash distributions of the restaurants they manage. The amount, terms and availability vary by country.
Trademarks - We regard our Outback®, Outback Steakhouse®, Carrabba’s Italian Grill®, Bonefish Grill® and Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar® service marks and our Bloomin’ Onion® trademark as having significant value and as being important factors in the marketing of our restaurants. We have also obtained trademarks and service marks for these and several of our other menu items and various advertising slogans both in the U.S. and in other countries where we operate. We are aware of names and marks similar to the service marks of ours used by other persons in certain geographic areas in which we have restaurants. However, we believe such uses will not adversely affect us. Our policy is to, whenever possible, pursue registration of our marks in countries where we 
BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.

operate and to vigorously oppose any infringement of our marks. We also have registered domain names for each of our concepts.
We license the use of our registered trademarks to franchisees and third parties through franchise and license arrangements. The franchise and license arrangements restrict franchisees’ and licensees’ activities with respect to the use of our trademarks and impose quality control standards in connection with goods and services offered in connection with the trademarks.
SEASONALITY
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, customer traffic patterns for our established U.S. restaurants are generally highest in the first quarter of the year and lowest in the third quarter of the year. International customer traffic patterns vary by market with Brazil historically experiencing minimal seasonal traffic fluctuations. Holidays may affect sales volumes seasonally in some of our markets. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have an impact on consumer behaviors and customer traffic that may result in temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business. Additionally, severe storms, extended periods of inclement weather or climate extremes resulting from climate change may also affect the seasonal operating results of the areas impacted.
See Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of risks related to seasonal and periodic fluctuations.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
We are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws affecting our business. Each of our restaurants is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which may include, among others, alcoholic beverage control, health and safety agencies, environmental and fire agencies in the state, municipality or country in which the restaurant is located. 
U.S. - During 2020, several governmental bodies in the U.S. addressed the spread of COVID-19 by imposing limitations on business operations or recommending that residents and/or employers adopt “social distancing”, vaccination and/or testing measures. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, formal and informal restraints, as well as consumer behavior, have materially affected the way we operate our business and serve our guests.
Alcoholic beverage sales represent 11% of our U.S. restaurant sales. Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authorities for a license or permit to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises and, where applicable, a permit to provide service for extended hours and on Sundays. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many state governors entered executive orders allowing restaurants to sell alcohol for carry-out or delivery. In most jurisdictions, alcohol licenses for restaurants did not previously allow for off-premises sales. Many of these executive orders remain in effect, with some states passing permanent legislation. We are currently offering alcohol to-go from certain locations from each of our restaurant concepts.
Our restaurant operations are also subject to federal and state laws for such matters as:
•immigration, employment, minimum wage, overtime, tip credits, worker conditions and health care; 
•menu labeling and food safety;
•the Americans with Disabilities Act, which, among other things, requires our restaurants to meet federally mandated requirements for the disabled; and 
•information security, data privacy, anti-corruption/anti-bribery, cashless payments and gift cards.
International - Our restaurants outside of the U.S. are subject to similar regional and local laws and regulations as our U.S. restaurants, including COVID-19-related mandates, labor, food safety, data privacy, anti-corruption/anti-bribery and information security.
BLOOMIN’ BRANDS, INC.

See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state, local and international regulation of our business.

Together we drive diversity, equity and inclusion through: 
•Leadership & Talent: attracting, retaining, developing and promoting diverse employees who reflect our communities at all levels of leadership. During 2021, we introduced updated leadership competencies, with inclusive leadership as a core behavior at every level of the organization. We launched new leadership development programs including Company-sponsored executive coaching, the Women of Color LeadHERship Development Program and the McKinsey Black Leaders Academy.
•Training & Education: strengthening our training and education programs to include listening, sharing and storytelling. Putting learning into action to inspire change and lead a culture of authenticity.

We use surveys to seek feedback from our Team Members on a variety of topics that include, but are not limited to, confidence in leadership, our company culture and overall satisfaction with the Company. We regularly monitor and evaluate turnover and attrition metrics throughout our management teams. Annual strategic talent reviews and succession planning for executive-level roles, senior management and key restaurant leadership positions help ensure consistency in management talent quality. 
We are committed to high standards of ethical, moral, and legal business conduct and strive to be an open and honest workplace, providing a positive work environment and fostering a culture of integrity and ethical decision-making. To support this commitment, we have a Code of Conduct that provides clear direction for behavioral expectations. Every employee, officer and director completes situational training annually. In addition, we maintain an Ethics and Compliance Hotline (the “Hotline”), where violations and other workplace concerns can be reported. Team Members can confidentially, and if desired, anonymously, use the Hotline to make a report online or to a live third-party operator in several languages, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Annually, we provide training and education to our salaried employees and most hourly employees with respect to our Code of Conduct, including our anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies. 
Workplace Safety - Employee health and safety in the workplace is of utmost importance to our Company. We believe that all employees, regardless of job role or title, have a shared responsibility in the promotion of health and safety in the workplace. We are committed to providing and following safety laws and rules, including internal policies and procedures. This commitment means carrying out company activities in ways that preserve and promote a clean, safe and healthy environment.

Total Rewards - Our total rewards philosophy is to motivate and retain our Team Members by offering, what we believe to be, competitive salary packages. To align Team Member objectives with the Company and ultimately our stockholders, Bloomin’ Brands offers programs that reward long-term performance. Additionally, we offer a well-rounded benefit package that includes the following, along with other benefits:
•Comprehensive health insurance coverage for Team Members working an average of 30 or more hours each week. This program includes wellness programs intended to proactively support healthcare and access to a health savings account that is eligible for employer contributions and is fully portable.
•Virtual therapy that takes place via mobile device or computer, allowing all Team Members, regardless of insurance enrollment with our Company, to access help when and where they need it, along with guided meditation options. The mental well-being of our Team Members is important to us.
•Our non-executive salaried Team Members are eligible to receive matching contributions in our 401(k) plan and have access to financial wellness resources.
Company Response to COVID-19 - During 2021, as the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact the lives of our Team Members, we offered educational resources to inform their vaccination decision. We also provided paid time off for hourly Team Members who elected to be vaccinated. 
In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 global crisis, we did not furlough any Team Members and provided $44.9 million of relief pay, excluding employee retention tax credits earned, for our field hourly Team Members who were impacted by closed dining rooms. We also paid the employee portion of benefits premiums for Team Members who received relief pay. In addition, Team Members who were quarantined or who had a personal illness related to COVID-19 received pay.
Employee Support and Community Engagement - Our commitment to our Team Members does not stop with competitive salaries, development and benefits. In 1999, we created a trust (the “Trust”) to support our Team Members in times of personal hardship. All contributions to the Trust are voluntary, employee-funded, and are not solicited from suppliers, customers or friends. Due to the incredible generosity and caring nature of our Team Members, the Trust is able to make meaningful monetary support to our Team Members who experience very difficult, often unexpected and catastrophic issues, in their lives. Since 2017, the Trust has paid approximately $1.6 million to the benefit of over 1,100 Team Members who applied for support.
We are inspired by the generosity of our Team Members and encourage them to give back to their communities. To facilitate this community engagement, Team Members at the Restaurant Support Center are given paid time off for approved community service activities during scheduled work hours.
