Item 1. Business.
 With the change in control of Living 3D Holdings, Inc. in December 2015, the Company redefined its business from 3D technology development to computer software development with major operations in Hong Kong and Mainland China. Since then, the Company focused on the research and development of ecommerce platform, mobile game and virtual reality application. Our ecommerce platform sought to integrate web application with product manufacturing which would increase the productivity and efficiency of the operation. Along with the ever increasing usage of the internet, our O2O (O2O stands for “online to offline,” a term used to describe a variety of ecommerce services that provide online information, services, or discounts to consumers that enhance their offline shopping experiences) ecommerce platform was expected to bring in more business opportunities to the manufacturer. 
 As our business development efforts in the O2O platforms were not sufficiently mature to render us as a commercially viable player in that industry, the Company has slowed down its activities in such development and shifted its business from the development of O2O platforms to the development of an online cryptocurrency web based trading system through the acquisition of Hong Kong Cryptocurrency Exchange (“HKCCEX”) in late December 2017.
 HKCCEX is a FinTech company with focus on developing no-frills software solutions that facilitate the wide spread adoption of cutting edge technological ideas. Our flagship product is a B2B cryptocurrency web based trading system featuring newsfeed, live quote, integrated CRM, agent management and accounting system. This web based trading system is then customized and provided to companies with previous experience in the financial, trading or similar fields allowing them to capture a new and existing market with minimum change to their current Modus Operandi. These companies have user right to the customized web based trading system, which allow their end-customers to trade cryptocurrencies as registered users. These companies mainly reside in Hong Kong and Singapore with many operating online with target pockets in the global market. We provide technical support to ensure that our web based trading system and customers work within the confines of their respective legal system, and we are very sensitive to any reaction of the legal system as a whole with regards to the regulation of cryptocurrencies. We provide our web based trading system with AML and KYC compliance support which we deem as an inalienable part of the web based trading system and management protocol, and we conduct thorough training sessions with our customers to ensure compliance and also the documentation and consequences of non-compliance.

 Corporate History
 The Company was incorporated on October 28, 1987 in the state of Nevada under the name Staco Incorporated. It was organized for the purpose of conducting business as a transfer agent. This business was unsuccessful as a transfer agent and the Company became inactive. The business remained inactive until November 30, 2001, when it acquired certain assets from Cordell Henrie, a sole proprietor doing business as "Concrete Casting" and he became its president. Staco Incorporated changed its name to Concrete Casting Incorporated on January 17, 2002. The assets acquired included drawings, plans and concepts regarding the design of replicas of antiquities to be

cast in concrete and marketed to the U.S. landscaping market. From such point through December 31, 2007, Concrete Casting focused on concrete products through its emphasis changed from replicas of antiquities to construction applications, such as casted window wells and water features for landscaping use. Mr. Henrie eventually was no longer able to devote the time necessary to Concrete Casting’s product development and he resigned as an officer and a director as of December 31, 2007. Because Concrete Casting's development in the concrete casting business was not sufficiently mature to make it commercially viable, the decision was made to shut down development of concrete products and discontinue those operations. 
 In 2008, Concrete Casting hired Kevin J. Asher as its new president to locate and acquire new business opportunities. At such time, Concrete Casting was a shell company with nominal assets whose sole business was to identify, evaluate and investigate various companies with the intent to effect a reverse merger transaction in which it would acquire a target company with an operating business to continue the acquired company’s business as a publicly-held entity. On July 1, 2010, Concrete Casting changed its name to "AirWare International Corp." and on September 27, 2011, AirWare International changed its name to "Living 3D Holdings, Inc."
 On December 8, 2011, certain of the prior shareholders of Living 3D Holdings, Inc. , a Nevada corporation and a publicly held and traded company (the "Company”), who were the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company (the "Selling Shareholders") and Jimmy Kent-Lam Wong, June Mon Yon, Chang Li, Kin Wah Ngai and Lin Su (each, a "Purchaser" and collectively, the "Purchasers"), entered into a stock purchase agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement").

L3D-BVI was incorporated on June 23, 2008 under the laws of the British Virgin Islands and was, at the time of the Stock Purchase and Share Exchange, a privately held company, while the Company was a publicly held and traded company on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol "CCSG." 
 Upon the completion of the Stock Purchase and the Share Exchange, our business became that of L3D-BVI, our wholly-owned subsidiary. As prior to the Stock Purchase and the Share Exchange, the Company had no operating activities, the financial statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis reflect the activity of L3D-BVI for all periods presented.
