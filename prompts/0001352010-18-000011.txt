These clients are included in our Emerging verticals which are further discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this annual report. 
Clients
Our clients primarily consist of Forbes Global 2000 corporations located in North America, Europe, CIS and APAC. We maintain a geographically diverse client base with 58.0% of our 2017 revenues derived from clients located in North America, 35.2% from clients in Europe, 4.7% from clients in the CIS and 2.1% from our clients in APAC. Our sustained growth and increased capabilities are furthered by both organic growth and strategic acquisitions. We continually evaluate potential acquisition targets that can expand our vertical-specific domain expertise, geographic footprint, service portfolio, client base and management expertise. 
Our focus on delivering quality to our clients is reflected by an average of 94.9% and 85.7% of our revenues in 2017 coming from clients that had used our services for at least one and two years, respectively. We have long-standing relationships with many of our top customers, however, we remain committed to diversifying our client base and we expect client concentration from our top clients to continue to decrease over the long-term. The following table shows revenues from the top five and ten customers in the respective year as a percentage of revenues for that year: 

 | % of Revenues for Year Ended December 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Top five clients | 24.0 | % | | 28.4 | % | 32.8 | %
Top ten clients | 33.9 | % | | 38.4 | % | 44.1 | %

The following table shows the distribution of our clients by revenues for the periods presented:
 | Year Ended December 31,
Revenues Greater Than or Equal To | 2017 | 2016 | 2015

See Note 17 “Segment Information” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding long-lived assets and client revenue by geographic location as well as financial information related to our reportable segments.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing efforts support our business strategy to increase revenues from new and existing clients through our senior management, sales and business development staff, account managers, and technical specialists. We maintain a dedicated sales force and a marketing team, which coordinates corporate-level branding efforts such as participation in and hosting of industry conferences and events and sponsorship of programming competitions. 
Given our focus on providing technical solutions to our clients’ complex challenges, our IT professionals play an integral role in engaging with clients on potential business opportunities. Our account managers maintain direct client relationships and are tasked with identifying new business opportunities and responding to requests-for-proposals (“RFPs”). Account managers typically engage technical and other specialists when pursuing opportunities. This sales model has been effective in promoting repeat business and growth from within our existing client base. 
In addition to effective client management, we believe that our reputation as a premium provider of software engineering solutions and information technology services drives additional business from inbound requests, referrals and RFPs. We enjoy published recognition from third-party industry observers, such as Forrester Research, Forbes Research, Everest Group, Zinnov, CIO Magazine, Information Week, and Software Magazine.
Our Delivery Model
We believe the development of a robust global delivery model creates a key competitive advantage, enabling us to better understand and meet our clients’ diverse needs and to provide a compelling value proposition. We serve clients through on-site, off-site and offshore locations across the world in Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Hungary, Poland, India, China, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Bulgaria, Armenia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Netherlands, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Hong Kong, Austria, Spain, Ireland and Australia. Our delivery centers are located strategically to offer a strong, diversified and cost-effective delivery platform to serve clients across North America, Europe and APAC. Our largest delivery centers are located in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. We continuously grow our delivery platform both organically and through acquired delivery centers and client management locations. Our revenue generating personnel numbered 22,998 as of December 31, 2017. 
As of December 31, 2017 we had 7,372 IT professionals located in Belarus. The majority of these IT professionals are located in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, which is well-positioned to serve as a prime IT outsourcing destination given its strong industrial base and established educational infrastructure. Furthermore, the IT industry in Belarus has been strongly supported by its government, which has taken steps to encourage investment in the IT sector through long-term tax incentives.
Our locations in Ukraine and Russia offer many of the same benefits as Belarus, including educational infrastructure, availability of qualified software engineers and government support of the IT industry. As of December 31, 2017, we had 4,818 IT professionals in Ukraine and 3,802 IT professionals in Russia. Our delivery model has not been materially affected by the political and economic uncertainty in Russia or Ukraine to date. 
Our other significant locations with IT professionals are Hungary with 1,460, the United States with 1,316, Poland with 1,167, India with 822 and China with 509 as of December 31, 2017. 
Human Capital
Attracting and retaining employees is a key factor in our ability to grow our revenues and meet our clients’ needs. We have dedicated full-time employees that oversee all aspects of our human capital management process including a professional talent acquisition team whose objective is to locate and attract qualified and experienced IT professionals within various EPAM locations. It is critical that we effectively plan our short-term and long-term recruitment needs and deploy the necessary personnel and processes to optimize utilization and quickly satisfy the demands of our clients. As our business grows, we also focus on hiring and retaining individuals with appropriate skills to fill our executive, finance, legal, HR and other key management positions. 
5

At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had a total of 25,962, 22,383 and 18,354 employees, respectively. Of these employees, as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, 22,998, 19,670 and 16,078 were revenue generating IT professionals. 
In our competitive industry, the ability to hire and retain highly-skilled information technology professionals is critical to our success. We believe the quality of our employees serves as a key point of differentiation in how we deliver a superior value proposition to our clients. To attract, retain and motivate our IT professionals, we offer a challenging work environment, ongoing skills development initiatives, attractive career advancement, and promotion opportunities thus providing an environment and culture that rewards entrepreneurial initiative and performance. 
Historically, we developed our base of IT professionals by hiring highly-qualified, experienced IT professionals from the CIS and CEE regions and by recruiting students from the regions’ leading universities. The quality and academic prestige of the CIS and CEE educational systems are renowned worldwide and we have strong relationships with the leading institutions in these geographies. We have established EPAM delivery centers near many of these university campuses. Our ongoing involvement with these universities includes supporting EPAM-branded research labs, developing training courses, providing teaching equipment, actively supporting curriculum development and engaging students to identify their talents and interests. Our relationships with these technical institutions provide us access to a highly-qualified talent pool.
 We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees and our employees have not entered into any collective bargaining agreements (other than broad industry-wide agreements as required in certain countries in Europe and Mexico) or engaged in any labor disputes.
Training and Development
We dedicate significant resources to the training and development of our IT professionals. We believe in the importance of supporting educational initiatives and we sponsor employees’ participation in internal and external training and certifications. 
We provide training, continuing education and career development programs for both entry-level and experienced IT professionals. Entry-level IT professionals undergo a rigorous training program that consists of approximately three to six months of classroom training, as well as numerous hours of hands-on training through actual engagements. This comprehensive program results in employees who are highly proficient and possess deep technical expertise that enables them to immediately serve our clients’ needs. For our mid-level and senior IT professionals, we offer continuing education programs aimed at helping them advance in their careers. We also provide mentoring opportunities, management and soft skills training, intensive workshops and management and technical advancement programs in order to support the development of middle and senior management through formal leadership training, evaluation, development and promotion.
Quality and Process Management
We have invested resources in developing a proprietary suite of internal applications and tools to manage all aspects of our delivery process. These applications and tools are targeted to reduce costs and security risks, while providing control and visibility across all project lifecycle stages both internally and to our clients. In addition, these applications, tools, methodologies and infrastructure allow us to seamlessly deliver services and solutions to global clients, further strengthening our relationships with them.
We are an ISAE 3402 Type 2 certified IT services provider. This certification is a widely recognized auditing standard developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and it serves as additional assurance to our clients regarding the control environment and the security of their sensitive data. Furthermore, this is an important certification for firms in data and information-intensive industries, as well as any organization that is subject to the internal controls certification requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our ISAE 3402 Type 2 certification, in addition to our multiple ISO 27001:2013 and ISO 9001:2015 attestations, underscores our focus on establishing stringent security standards and internal controls.
Our proprietary ISO 9001:2015 and CMMI-certified Quality Management System has been documented, implemented and maintained to ensure the timely delivery of software development services to our clients. We have also developed sophisticated project management techniques facilitated through our Project Management Center, a web-based collaborative environment for software development, which we consider critical to meeting or exceeding the service levels required by our clients.

Our Quality Management System ensures that we provide timely delivery of software development services to enhance client satisfaction by enabling:

• | objective valuation of the performed process, work products and services against the client’s process descriptions, standards and procedures;


• | identification, documentation and timely resolution of noncompliance issues;


• | feedback to the client’s project staff and managers on the results of quality assurance activities;


• | monitoring and improvement of the software development process to ensure adopted standards and procedures are implemented and flaws are detected and resolved in a timely manner; and


• | execution of planned and systematic problem prevention activities.

Our proprietary Project Management Center supports our software development delivery model. Our Project Management Center is effective in reducing risks and providing control and visibility across all project lifecycle stages based on the following features:

• | multi-site, multi-project capabilities;


• | activity-based software development lifecycle, which fully tracks the software development activities through the project documentation;


• | project, role-based access control, which can be available to us, clients and third parties;


• | fully configurable workflow engine with built-in notification and messaging;


• | extensive reporting capabilities and tracking of key performance indicators; and


• | integration with Microsoft Project and Outlook.

The transparency and visibility into software development project deliverables, resource management, team messaging and project-related documents and files provided by our Project Management Center promotes collaboration and strengthens our relationships with our clients. Improved traceability enables significant time savings and cost reductions for business users and IT management during change management for the software development lifecycle. The combination of our Project Management Center with our other proprietary internal applications enhances our offering by reducing errors, increasing quality, effectiveness and oversight, and improving maintenance time. 
Competition
The markets in which we compete are changing rapidly and we face competition from both global technology solutions providers as well as those based primarily in specific geographies with lower cost labor such as CEE, India and China. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include technical expertise and industry knowledge, end-to-end solution offerings, reputation and track record for high-quality and on-time delivery of work, effective employee recruiting, training and retention, responsiveness to clients’ business needs, scale, financial stability and price.
We face competition primarily from Accenture, Atos Origin, Capgemini, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Deloitte Digital, DXC Technology, Exlservice, Genpact, GlobalLogic, Globant S.A., HCL Technologies, HP Enterprise, IBM Global Services, Infosys Technologies, Luxoft Holding, Inc., Mindtree, Syntel, Inc., Perficient, Tata Consultancy Services, Virtusa Corporation, and Wipro, among others. Additionally, we compete with numerous smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which we operate.
We believe that our focus on complex software product development solutions, our technical employee base, and the development and continuous improvement in process methodologies, applications and tools position us well to compete effectively in the future. 
Intellectual Property
Protecting our intellectual property rights is important to our business. We have invested, and will continue to invest, in research and development to enhance our domain knowledge and create complex, specialized solutions for our clients. We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. We require our employees, vendors and independent contractors to enter into written agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us, which assign to us all intellectual property and work product made, developed or conceived by them in connection with their employment with us. These agreements also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed or otherwise made available by us remains confidential. 
7

We also enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our clients. These customary agreements cover our use of the clients’ software systems and platforms as our clients usually own the intellectual property in the products we develop for them. Furthermore, we usually grant a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive, transferable and non-revocable license to our clients to use our preexisting intellectual property, but only to the extent necessary in order to use the software or systems we developed for them.
Regulations
Due to the industry and geographic diversity of our operations and services, our operations are subject to a variety of rules and regulations. Several foreign and U.S. federal and state agencies regulate various aspects of our business. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — We are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other countries in which we operate, including export restrictions, economic sanctions and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-corruption laws. If we are not in compliance with applicable legal requirements, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other remedial measures”.
