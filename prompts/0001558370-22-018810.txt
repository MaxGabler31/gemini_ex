​
Product Platforms and Applications Overview 
​
Our product portfolio is based on two electrochemical platforms, carbonate and solid oxide. The platforms are similar in many ways, but they also have unique capabilities. Both platforms can support power generation and combined heat and power applications using a variety of fuels, including natural gas, renewable biogas, and hydrogen. The fuel cells utilized in these platforms react fuel electrochemically, without combusting the fuel, which avoids emissions produced by combustion such as nitrogen oxides (“NOx”), sulfur oxides (“SOx”) and particulates. In the electrochemical process, fuel and air are reacted in separate chambers in the fuel cell stack. The reactions producing CO2 happen before the fuel is mixed with air, and the CO2 is concentrated and therefore easy to capture. Both our carbonate and solid oxide platforms are enabled to capture their own CO2 for use or sequestration before it is emitted into the air. However, our carbonate platforms are unique in their ability to also capture CO2 from an external source, utilizing the flue stream of a power plant or an industrial boiler as a replacement for traditional air intake.
​
Our solid oxide platform can operate on pure hydrogen fuel. We believe this feature will gain importance in the future as hydrogen becomes more widespread as a fuel, and in the more near term as we work to deploy our technology for hydrogen-based energy storage.
​
Both platforms can be used in electrolysis, which is the reverse of fuel cell operation – producing hydrogen from power. Carbonate platforms use a mixture of reforming and electrolysis, while solid oxide platforms can be used for pure hydrogen electrolysis.
​
Our multi-featured platforms can be configured to provide a number of value streams, including electricity, hydrogen, high grade heat (including steam), water and CO2 upgradable to food and beverage grade and/or usable in cement or other industrial products, and to concentrate and separate CO2 from fossil-fueled industrial applications allowing the sequestration and/or utilization of the CO2. We are focused on using our proprietary technology to pursue the following four significant industry applications, each of which we believe is important to the global energy transition and to limiting global warming:

• | Distributed generation (commercially available);
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Distributed hydrogen (commercially available);
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (“SOEC”) based hydrogen production leveraging electrolysis, long-duration hydrogen energy storage and Reversible Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (“RSOFC”) for the low to zero carbon production of electricity utilizing pure hydrogen as the feedstock (under development and available for order); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Carbon capture from external sources (under development) and carbon separation and utilization enabling carbon capture utilization and sequestration (“CCUS”) (commercially available).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Market Opportunity
​
Climate initiatives are driving the global push to reduce greenhouse gases, including CO2, NOx and SOx. We believe a large and increasing combined total addressable market (“TAM”) opportunity exists for solutions we currently have commercially available today and those solutions that we are actively developing for commercialization. Through the capabilities of our platforms, we provide clean, reliable baseload power generation (baseload power generation is power generated over a period of time at a steady rate), hydrogen production, high grade heat, isolation and removal of CO2 from exhaust streams, and the ability to use biofuels, renewable natural gas (“RNG”), and a hydrogen-hydrocarbon fuel blend for power generation feedstock. In addition, we are focused on advancing the commercialization of our platform technology to utilize pure hydrogen for baseload power generation and to perform electrolysis to convert water and electricity into hydrogen and to isolate and remove CO2 from external exhaust streams. 
​
Hydrogen enables zero emissions transportation by utilizing a zero-carbon feedstock as the fuel to power cars, trucks, buses, ships, trains, and, in the future, aircraft and other aerospace applications. Hydrogen is also capable of providing the fuel needed to produce high grade heat for industrial applications such as steel and glass production, in addition to its traditional uses for the refining process, in making ammonia, cement, and chemicals, in building heat, for combustion power generation, and even for residential heating.
​
Hydrogen is also an effective medium for the storage of energy, and we are in the process of commercializing a highly efficient and environmentally favorable hydrogen-based long-duration energy storage solution. We believe hydrogen-based storage is environmentally superior to a mineral-based storage solution such as lithium-ion batteries. Additionally, through the deployment of our megawatt and sub-megawatt power generation platform solutions, we can deliver the benefits of clean, distributed power generation, including the desirable value stream of thermal energy, and avoid the need for massive, long distance transmission infrastructure and the risks that the traditional transmission grid creates.
​
CO2 is also a valuable input ingredient in many products and processes. We believe that, by using more CO2 (carbon capture utilization) and emitting less CO2 through the efficiencies of our platforms and by capturing CO2 at the source point, the use of our platforms can positively impact climate change. Our platforms are capable of delivering CO2 for food and beverage use, pH balancing of water supply, extending the shelf life of food vital to global food supply and food security, as a binder in a number of materials from concrete to sustainable building materials and the production of synthetic fuels, polymers and other minerals. 
​
1 See the section entitled “Critical Assumptions and Additional Information Regarding Calculation of our Total Addressable Market Opportunity” on page 39 for important information regarding the sources and assumptions used in estimating the value of these market opportunities
​
We view TAM as the overall revenue opportunity that is available for a product or solution if 100% market share is achieved. We believe that the combined value of the TAM opportunity for the markets that may be served by our solutions which are commercially available and solutions which are actively under development by the Company is approximately $2 trillion cumulatively from the date hereof through the end of calendar year 2030 (the “Measuring Period”). Our estimate of the combined, cumulative value of our TAM opportunity is based on review and analysis of third-party sources and application of management’s current assumptions and business judgment as to our market opportunities within the markets

We have developed and begun implementing a plan to reduce our carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. As part of this plan, during fiscal year 2022, we: 

● | Calculated our organizational carbon footprint baseline;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | Conducted product life cycle assessments (“LCAs”) to understand emissions throughout the value chain;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Set short term goals (2030) and long-term goals (2050) aligned with science-based targets;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Worked to develop milestones to net zero emissions to guide our Scope 1, 2 and 3 (as described in the Green House Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard) emissions reduction goals and track our year over year progress; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Engaged team members on our net zero journey and realigned our board committee charters to more formally establish oversight of the Company’s ESG efforts.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our platforms have a direct impact on reducing our customers’ Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions thus lowering the global environmental footprint of baseload power generation. However, our platforms are designed to go beyond power generation, delivering hydrogen, carbon separation, water, and thermal energy in various applications. As a result of our platforms’ ability to deliver multiple value streams, we help our customers reduce their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions on-site without buying off-site carbon/environmental offsets, which do not positively impact the local communities’ air quality or emissions. In the future, we plan to commercialize our hydrogen, long-duration energy storage, and carbon capture technologies intended to drive next generation solutions to help customers attain their decarbonization goals. 
​
Our patented products offer a sustainable alternative to traditional internal combustion-based power generation and reliable baseload power compared to intermittent sources such as wind, solar, and run of river hydro power. Traditional power plants create harmful emissions, such as NOx, SOx and particulate matter, that are a serious public health concern and have a direct impact on the communities in which these plants operate. Intermittent sources, generally, avoid fewer emissions than our fuel cell platforms. Alternatively, our energy platforms use a combustion-free power generation process that is virtually free of pollutants. When a fuel is combusted (as in traditional power generation), carbon is emitted in addition to SOx, NOx, and other particulates. When intermittent power sources go offline because the sun is not shining, the wind is not blowing, or water is not flowing, they rely on traditional fossil-fueled power resources such as coal and natural gas to provide electricity. Our platforms are highly efficient and environmentally friendly products that support the “Triple Bottom Line” concept of sustainability, consisting of environmental, social, and economic considerations. 
​
As an enterprise, we are proud that, in October 2018, we were certified ISO 14001:2015 compliant, having demonstrated the establishment of and adherence to an environmental management system standard. We believe that we are the only fuel cell manufacturer to have received this certification.
Our commitment to sustainability is also evident in the design, manufacturing, installation and on-going servicing of our fuel cell energy platforms, which are engineered for the circular economy. For example, when our platforms reach the end of their useful lives, we have the capability to refurbish and re-use certain parts and also recycle more than 90% by weight of what we cannot re-use. This is a departure from combustion-based, wind, and solar power generation methods that typically produce a significant amount of unrecyclable waste which increases landfill use. The balance of plant (“BOP”) is designed to have an operating life of 25-to-30 years, at which time metals such as steel and copper are reclaimed for scrap value. For context, by weight, approximately 93% of the entire energy platform can be re-used or recycled at the end of its useful life.
​
​
Our Business Strategy

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Our global SureSource product line is uniformly based on the same carbonate fuel cell technology, and offers the following advantages:
​

● | Sustainable: With the commercialization of our solid oxide platform, we will be able to offer two highly differentiated high temperature platforms. Our solutions produce electricity electrochemically − without combustion − and operate at a low decibel level, which enables siting of the power plants within dense, urban
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

areas while meeting clean air permitting regulations. We believe that our solutions represent an important local public health benefit and they often generate tax revenues for the local community. Fuel cells also reduce carbon emissions compared to less efficient combustion-based power generation and avoid greater emissions than intermittent renewable energy resources.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Flexible: Our solutions can operate on renewable natural gas, on-site renewable biogas, directed biogas, natural gas, flare gas and propane to offer combined heat and power (“CHP”) and are scalable to add power incrementally as demand grows. Our solid oxide platform is also capable of operating on hydrogen. For our carbonate platform, the unique chemistry of our fuel cells allows them to directly use low Btu on-site biogas utilizing our proprietary gas cleanup skid (SureSource TreatmentTM), with no reduction in output or efficiency compared to operation on natural gas. We developed our proprietary biogas cleanup and contaminant monitoring equipment which, combined with the inherent suitability of the carbonate fuel cell chemistry, gives us an advantage in on-site biogas applications. In addition, we have demonstrated operation of our carbonate fuel cell technology with other fuel sources including coal syngas, propane, and hydrogen-natural gas blend. We believe traditional oil and gas companies as well as new market entrants will continue to develop and increase the supply of renewable natural gas which would benefit our customers given the fuel flexibility of our platforms. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Reliable: Our solutions improve power reliability and energy security by lessening reliance on the transmission and distribution infrastructure of the electric grid. Unlike solar, wind, and run of river hydro power, fuel cells are able to operate continuously regardless of weather, time of day, water levels, or geographic location.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Standardized: Our solutions use a standard cell design globally, enabling supply chain volume-based cost reduction, optimal resource utilization and long-life product enhancements.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Attractive Thermal Attributes: In addition to electricity, our standard fuel cell configuration produces high quality thermal energy (approximately 700° F), suitable for heating facilities or water, or steam for industrial processes or for absorption cooling. The high thermal value may allow customers to reduce or eliminate their burning of fuel in carbon intensive boilers, which should reduce emissions that contribute to their Scope 1 emissions. When configured for CHP, our system efficiencies can potentially reach up to 90%, depending on the application. When configured for distributed hydrogen, our plants produce hydrogen in addition to power and water, with a potential effective efficiency (counting the fuel that would have been used to produce hydrogen conventionally) of up to 80% before considering waste heat utilization, which can raise the total efficiency even higher.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Use of Readily Available Catalyst Material: As our fuel cells are designed to operate at approximately 1,100° F, our platform solution has a key advantage afforded high temperature fuel cells, specifically that they do not require the use of geographically limited precious metal electrodes required by lower temperature fuel cells, such as proton exchange membrane (“PEM”), phosphoric acid (“PAFC”), and alkaline (“AFC”) fuel cells. As a result, we are able to use less expensive and more readily available industrial metals, primarily nickel and stainless steel, as catalysts for our fuel cell components.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Easy to Site: Our fuel cell energy platforms are easily sited with a relatively small footprint and low decibel operating level given the amount of power produced, allowing our platforms to be located at the point of demand. They require significantly less land than solar and wind projects. There is minimal noise produced by the mechanical BOP and our fuel cell platforms have a clean emissions profile, making our fuel cell energy platforms ideally suited for urban locations and in suburban applications at or near the point of energy consumption. Locating our platforms on-site also contributes directly to reducing our customers’ Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Scalable: Our platforms are scalable, providing a cost-effective solution to adding power incrementally as demand grows, such as multi-megawatt fuel cell parks supporting the electric grid and large scale commercial and industrial operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Forward Compatibility: Our fuel cells are multi-fuel capable, allowing a customer to deploy our platforms today utilizing natural gas and to migrate in the future to biofuels, renewable natural gas, and/or a hydrogen

and natural gas blend as those fuels become more abundant. In addition, upon commercialization of our solid oxide platform, we expect that customers will be able to utilize 100% hydrogen for power production.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Product Efficiency and Effectiveness
The electrical efficiency of our carbonate fuel cell solutions ranges from approximately 47% to 60% upon initial operations of our platforms depending on the configuration. When configured for CHP, our system efficiencies can potentially reach up to 90%, depending on the application. Our solutions are designed to deliver high electrical efficiency where the power is used, avoiding transmission. Transmission line losses average about 5% for the U.S. grid, which represents inefficiency, resulting in additional emissions and a hidden cost to utility customers. In addition, overhead transmission lines have been shown to contribute to the ignition of wildfires in certain geographies, causing significant damage and loss of homes and life.
We are targeting very high efficiencies for our solid oxide platforms, which are currently under development. In fuel cell mode, we are targeting efficiencies in the low to high 60% range depending on the fuel type. In electrolysis mode, we are targeting electrical efficiency of about 90%, increasing to approximately 100% when augmented by externally supplied waste heat. In reversible mode, we expect round trip efficiencies in the high 60% range.
​
We have demonstrated up to 95% carbon capture from simulated coal power plant sources while simultaneously producing baseload power. For harder to capture streams, such as natural gas power generation or industrial boiler capture, we can achieve similarly high capture levels but with reduced power output. Our development work with EMTEC is focused on maximizing power output capabilities at high capture levels. We believe we will be able to operate at capture levels of 90% or better at economically acceptable power output levels with industrial boiler sources, and, with continued development, we expect to be able to cost-effectively capture high percentages of carbon from lower concentration streams in the future.
​
Our Product Platforms and Applications – Current and Future
We are focused on using our proprietary technology to pursue the following four significant industry applications to decarbonize power and produce hydrogen: 

​

• | Distributed generation (commercially available);
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Distributed hydrogen (commercially available);
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | SOEC based hydrogen production leveraging electrolysis, long-duration hydrogen energy storage and RSOFCs for the low to zero carbon production of electricity utilizing pure hydrogen as the feedstock (under development and available for order); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Carbon capture from external sources (under development) and carbon separation and utilization enabling CCUS (commercially available).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Distributed Generation
​
Our proprietary, patented SureSource platforms generate electricity directly from a hydrogen-rich fuel, such as biogas, renewable natural gas, natural gas or an up to 50% blend of hydrogen and natural gas. This multi-fuel capability enables the SureSource platform to leverage the established natural gas infrastructure that is readily available in our existing and target markets, compared to some types of fuel cells that can only operate on high purity hydrogen. Our proprietary technology also allows us to utilize on-site biogas, renewable natural gas or a hydrogen and natural gas blend, the application of which is rapidly expanding around the world, to fuel our platforms.
​
We market different configurations and applications of our SureSource platform to meet specific market needs, including:
​

• | On-Site Power (also known as “Behind the Meter”): Customers benefit from improved power resilience, energy security from on-site power that reduces reliance on the electric grid in an environmentally responsible manner, and long-term electric and other value stream price certainty. Additionally, thermal energy produced

by our fuel cells can be used to produce hot water or steam or to drive high efficiency absorption chillers for cooling applications for commercial and industrial customers. The SureSource platform can also deliver hydrogen and carbon dioxide for beverage and food production in addition to other industrial uses. Carbon separated can also be sequestered depending upon the use case.
​

• | Utility Grid Support: Our SureSource energy platforms are scalable, enabling multiple fuel cell platforms to be located together on a very small footprint per MW generated. This capability enables utilities to add multi-megawatt power generation to enhance electric grid resiliency where needed, without the associated cost, inefficiencies of a transmission system, and other associated above-ground transmission risks. Our fuel cells can solidify the total utility power generation solution when combined with intermittent sources, such as solar or wind, or less efficient combustion-based equipment that provides peaking or load following power.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

• | Microgrid Applications: SureSource platforms can also be configured as a microgrid, either independently or with other forms of power generation, with the goal of providing continuous power and a seamless transition during times of grid outages. We have deployed multiple microgrids leveraging our platform solutions, some individually and some integrated with other forms of power generation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Distributed Hydrogen
​
SureSource platforms are configurable to deliver on-site hydrogen for transportation, industrial applications, natural gas blending, repowering combustion-based equipment with zero carbon hydrogen, and other uses. The SureSource Hydrogen platform utilizes proprietary fuel cells configured to simultaneously generate three value streams — power generation, hydrogen, and water. When operated on biogas or renewable natural gas, SureSource Hydrogen systems produce renewable hydrogen, also known as Green Hydrogen, but, even when fueled with natural gas, our platforms produce hydrogen with a lower carbon and criteria pollutant impact when compared to conventional steam methane reforming (“SMR”) applications because of the use of internal heat compared to burning fuel in the case of SMRs. Heat and steam are byproducts of fuel cell operation, allowing Trigen platforms to produce hydrogen without water consumption (in fact with net water production, making our Trigen platform a unique platform for hydrogen production) and with a low carbon footprint. Adding carbon separation or carbon capture to the SureSource Hydrogen platform when fueled with natural gas will deliver Blue Hydrogen (i.e., hydrogen produced with carbon capture). The following figure illustrates the concept of the SureSource Hydrogen platform and identifies typical applications for our distributed hydrogen application.
​

Trigen Distributed Hydrogen Platform
​
Solid Oxide Technology - Long Duration Hydrogen-Based Energy Storage and Electrolysis
​
We are in the process of commercializing a solution for long duration energy storage using our proprietary solid oxide electrolysis technology which is expected to enable production of hydrogen with high electrical efficiency. We believe that our platform will deliver higher efficiency than our competitors and competing technologies with or without the addition of waste heat. 
​
Our solid oxide stacks are designed to alternate between electrolysis and power generation mode, with one of our design goals being improved integration of intermittent wind and solar power generation sources into the modern electrical grid via long duration storage of energy. Hydrogen-based long duration energy storage has the ability to transform the way intermittent resources are supported today as an alternative to combustion energy sources for continuous power. Instead of producing power from fuel and air, a solid oxide fuel cell stack in electrolysis mode splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using supplied carbon-free electricity. The hydrogen can be stored as compressed gas, creating the ability to produce a virtually limitless supply. When the grid needs to discharge power, the stored hydrogen will be sent back to the same solid oxide stacks, which react it with air to produce power and to regenerate the water, which will be stored for the next cycle. 
​
Long duration hydrogen-based energy storage can be achieved without the need to add excessive amounts of conventional battery capacity, a capacity that is reliant on rare earth minerals such as lithium and cobalt, both of which have supply constraints for broad adoption, require extensive mining, present long-term disposal challenges post-use, and are impacted by geopolitical risks associated with supply and mineral processing. The Democratic Republic of the Congo and People’s Republic of China (“China”) were collectively responsible for approximately 70% and 60% of global production of cobalt and rare earth elements, respectively, in 2019. High levels of production concentration, compounded by complex supply chains, increase the risks that could arise from physical disruption, trade restrictions or other developments in major producing countries, jeopardizing energy security. 
​
Long duration hydrogen-based energy storage is expected to be required at large scale in order to manage the forecasted high penetration of intermittent renewable resources globally, and we believe the water/hydrogen-based approach of our 

18




solid oxide fuel cell/solid oxide electrolysis cell/reversible solid oxide fuel cell technology has the potential to be a key enabler of long duration hydrogen-based energy storage. Hydrogen can be produced locally, is less reliant on energy transition minerals and is regenerative. We believe hydrogen as an energy storage medium is superior to mineral-based storage platforms.
​
We are also developing advanced electrolysis systems based on our solid oxide electrolysis platform, which can operate at higher electrical efficiency than currently available electrolysis technologies. The largest factor in the cost of electrolysis-produced hydrogen is the cost of electricity. Consequently, efficiency is one of the most effective ways to lower cost. We believe our solid oxide platform is among the most efficient available electrolysis technologies. This is expected to translate to a 20% to 30% lower cost of hydrogen compared to lower efficiency and low-temperature electrolysis. We believe our solid oxide platform offers one of the best chances of achieving the $1 USD per kg levelized cost of hydrogen targeted by the U.S. Department of Energy by 2050. Applications for this technology include centralized large scale hydrogen production from grid-scale renewables or nuclear power, and decentralized hydrogen production for industrial, transportation, repowered combustion generation assets, and synthetic or sustainable fuels for use in aviation and other applications. 
​
During fiscal year 2022, we operated a sub scale demonstration project of our solid oxide electrolysis technology in our Danbury test facility. We have been awarded a pilot program to provide a packaged 150 kg/day system for demonstration at Idaho National Laboratory. Idaho National Laboratory is currently conducting stack tests to evaluate performance and durability and we expect our solid oxide electrolysis technology to be placed in service during fiscal year 2023. 
​
We have recently completed conversion of the Danbury electrolysis demonstration system to a reversible system, adding equipment for supply of hydrogen to the stack to make power. We have begun testing the system in RSOFC mode, alternating the test stack between production of hydrogen in electrolysis mode and consumption of hydrogen in fuel cell mode. This is an extension of previous tests with single cells or smaller stacks which demonstrated stable operation in RSOFC mode.
​
During fiscal year 2022, we entered into an agreement with Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, for the purchase of our first 250 kW solid oxide fuel cell power generation system. Power and heat produced from the platform will be used at Trinity’s campus in Hartford, Connecticut, to lower energy cost and enhance energy reliability and security. This solid oxide fuel cell power generation system is expected to be installed late in fiscal year 2023. Our solid oxide platform is manufactured at our manufacturing and research and development facility in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. While we are currently accepting orders for our solid oxide platform, the timing of delivery of future orders will depend on our ability to increase production capacity to meet anticipated demand. 
​
Carbon Capture, Separation and Utilization
​

• | Carbon Capture – Power generation and industrial applications are the source of two-thirds of the world’s carbon emissions. Cost effective and efficient carbon capture from these two applications globally represents a large market because it could enable clean use of all available fuels. The SureSource CaptureTM system is being designed to separate and concentrate CO2 from the flue gases of natural gas, biomass or coal-fired power plants or other industrial facilities as a side reaction that extracts and purifies the CO2 in the flue gas during the power generation process and destroys approximately 70% of NOx emissions during the power generation process.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The production of additional baseload power during the carbon capture process, as opposed to consuming power, differentiates the SureSource Capture system from other forms of carbon capture offerings. This added revenue attribute could make the SureSource Capture system more cost effective than other systems which are being considered, or are currently in use, for carbon capture. SureSource Capture systems can be implemented incrementally, managing capital outlay to match decarbonization objectives and regulatory requirements. Since our solution generates a return on capital resulting from the fuel cell's production of electricity compared to an increase in operating expense incurred by other carbon capture technologies, it can extend the life of existing power plants and industrial facilities. 
​
We have a Joint Development Agreement with EMTEC, which first became effective on October 31, 2019 and was executed in fiscal year 2020 (as amended from time to time, the “EMTEC Joint Development Agreement”). Under this agreement, we have engaged in exclusive research and development efforts with 

19




EMTEC to evaluate and develop new and/or improved carbonate fuel cells to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from industrial and power sources. Since April 30, 2022, we have been operating under the second extension to the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement, which was to run through December 31, 2022 and allowed for the continuation of research intended to enable us and EMTEC to: (i) gain an improved understanding of the fuel cell operating envelope for various carbon capture applications; and (ii) complete data collection to support the project gate decision to use the developed technology in a Company fuel cell module demonstration for capturing carbon at ExxonMobil’s Rotterdam facility. In addition, under this second extension, we and EMTEC agreed to conduct a joint market study to (a) define application opportunities, commercialization strategies, and development requirements, (b) identify partners for potential pilot/demonstration projects, and (c) assess fuel cell/stack/module manufacturing scale-up and cost reduction. As of October 31, 2022, we were still collaborating with EMTEC on the joint market study, which was completed in early fiscal year 2023. On December 19, 2022, we and EMTEC entered into a third amendment to and extension of the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement, effective December 1, 2022, which extends the term through August 31, 2023 (unless terminated earlier) and is intended to (I) allow for continuation of research that would enable us and EMTEC to finalize data collection in support of the project gate decision to use the developed technology in a Company fuel cell module demonstration for capturing carbon at ExxonMobil’s Rotterdam facility, (II) allow for the continuation of the development, engineering and mechanical derisking of the Generation 2 Technology fuel cell module prototype, and (III) allow for studying the manufacturing scale-up and cost reduction of a commercial Generation 2 Technology fuel cell carbon capture facility.
​

● | Carbon Separation and Utilization – In addition to the ability to capture carbon dioxide from an external source, we are adding the capability to our platforms to extract and purify carbon dioxide produced by the fuel cell power generation process. Our carbon separation technology allows carbon dioxide to be easily extracted and purified to the appropriate level for utilization or sequestration, significantly reducing the carbon footprint of the generated power from our fuel cell platforms. This requires a simple modification to the fuel cell module that can be incorporated into new platforms as well as retrofitted for existing systems during stack replacements. Over time, as we replace fuel cell stacks in our deployed modules, we intend to integrate our carbon separation technology, making every platform receiving a module upgrade carbon separation ready. One attractive application for this technology is the on-site production of carbon dioxide for use in beverage and food production, in addition to other uses such as pH balancing of water, the production of dry ice, as a binder in cement and concrete production, utilization in grow houses, the production of ethanol and synthetic fuels, and numerous other industrial applications and building materials. The ability to provide clean power, heat, and useable carbon dioxide is a unique feature profile that we believe is only available with our SureSource platform. Our systems are modular and scalable, so they can be deployed in a wide variety of applications where on-site carbon dioxide is consumed as a product solution, or carbon dioxide is delivered to multiple nearby consumers. An illustration of the carbon separation application is shown in the following figure, which also shows potential applications for locally produced carbon dioxide.

Carbon separated from our platforms can also be sequestered in instances where the project does not include a use for carbon.

The utilities and independent power producer market has historically been our largest market with customers that include utilities on the East and West coasts of the United States, such as UIL Holdings Corporation, Inc. (owned by Avangrid, 

21




Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Iberdrola), the Long Island Power Authority (“LIPA”) and Southern California Edison. In Europe, utility customers include E.ON Connecting Energies, one of the largest utilities in the world. In South Korea, we are contracted to operate and maintain a 20 MW power plant project (comprised of five SureSource 3000 plants) for Korea Southern Power Company (“KOSPO”). In addition, as of October 31, 2022, our platform technology is deployed across South Korea at another 7 sites totaling more than 144 MW through our previous relationship with POSCO Energy Co., Ltd. (“POSCO Energy”). Upgrading each of those sites over time with new stacks would require us to produce more than 116 MW of stack replacements at our manufacturing facility in Torrington, which does not include the 28 MW of stack replacements which were delivered to KFC in fiscal year 2022.
Our SureSource power platforms are producing power for a variety of industrial, commercial, municipal and government customers, including manufacturing facilities, pharmaceutical processing facilities, universities, healthcare facilities and wastewater treatment facilities. These institutions expect efficient, clean and continuous power to reduce operating expenses, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avoid pollutant emissions to meet their sustainability goals, while boosting resiliency and limiting dependence on the distribution grid. CHP applications further support economic and sustainability initiatives by minimizing or avoiding the use of combustion-based boilers for heat. Our SureSource power platforms are unique in their ability to run on biogas. 
We market our products primarily in the United States, Europe and South Korea, and we are also pursuing expanding opportunities in other countries around the world.
We target for expansion and development markets and geographic regions that:

● | Benefit from and value clean distributed generation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | Are located where there are high energy costs, poor grid reliability, and/or challenged transmission and distribution lines;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Have a need for distributed hydrogen for transportation or industry;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Can leverage the multiple value streams delivered by our SureSource platforms (electricity, hydrogen, thermal, water, and carbon separation);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Are aligned with regulatory frameworks that harmonize energy, economic and environmental policies; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Are committed to reducing their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

Our business model focuses on providing these markets and geographic regions with highly efficient and affordable distributed generation that delivers de-centralized power in a low-carbon, virtually pollutant-free manner. Geographic markets that meet these criteria and where we are already well established include the Northeastern United States and California. We have also installed and are operating plants in Europe and Asia, mainly South Korea, in addition to North America. 
We have made significant progress in reducing costs and creating markets since the commercialization of our products in 2003, with more than 220 MW of our SureSource technology installed and operating as of October 31, 2022. 
We believe that we can accelerate and expand the adoption of our distributed power generation solutions through: 

● | further reductions in the total cost of ownership;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | increasing understanding of total avoided emissions and continued education regarding the multiple value streams that our solutions provide;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | continued improvements in product quality, power efficiency, and stack life;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increasing brand recognition and understanding of our differentiated platform portfolio;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expanding our sub megawatt platform to include solid oxide for both hydrogen power production and utilization of hydrogen rich fuels;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22





● | geographic and segment expansion;
--+----------------------------------


● | working to increase demand for on-site generation and microgrid expansion; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product expansion across carbon separation and utilization, carbon capture and distributed hydrogen.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Increasing Biogas Application Market Demand
With the growing market for anaerobic digestion (the production of biogas from the breakdown of biodegradable materials in the absence of oxygen) and increasingly stringent regulations regarding air quality, we see a growing market opportunity that we believe is perfectly suited for our fuel cell design. SureSource power platforms operating on biogas are an especially compelling value proposition as they convert a waste product into clean electricity and heat, while reducing or eliminating flaring, which addresses certain economic, environmental, and sustainability challenges faced by our customers and the communities in which they operate. 
Biogas is generated by the decay of organic material (i.e., biomass). This decaying organic material releases methane, or biogas. As a harmful greenhouse gas, biogas cannot be released directly into the atmosphere. Flaring of biogas creates pollutants and wastes this potential fuel source. Capturing and using biogas as a fuel addresses these challenges and provides a carbon-neutral renewable fuel source. Our patented, proprietary clean-up skid, SureSource TreatmentTM, provides an economical and reliable system for treating biogas for use on-site at the biogas production facility. Examples of producers of biogas as part of their operations include wastewater treatment facilities, food and beverage processors and agricultural operations. 
Our SureSource power platforms convert this biogas into electricity and heat efficiently and economically. Wastewater treatment facilities with anaerobic digesters are an attractive market for our SureSource solution including the power platform as well as treatment of the biogas. Many wastewater treatment plants currently flare biogas produced in the anaerobic digestion process, emitting NOx, SOx and particulate matter into the atmosphere, which does not meet many air quality regulations. Since our fuel cells operate on the biogas produced by the wastewater treatment process and the heat is used to support daily operations at the wastewater treatment facility, the overall thermal efficiency of these installations is high, supporting economics and sustainability. In addition, the fuel cell does not emit the harmful NOx, SOx and particulate matter that come out of a flare or that would result from the use of traditional combustion-based power generation. The unique chemistry of carbonate fuel cells allows them to use low Btu on-site biogas with no reduction in output or efficiency compared to operation on natural gas. We have developed proprietary biogas cleanup and contaminant monitoring equipment which, combined with the inherent suitability of the carbonate fuel cell chemistry, gives us an advantage in on-site biogas applications. Our SureSource 1500 and SureSource 3000 power platforms were the first systems certified to California Air Resource Board emissions standards under the Distributed Generation Certification Program for operation with on-site biogas within the state of California.
Microgrid and resiliency applications
Our fuel cell solutions are also well suited for microgrid applications, either as the sole source of power generation or integrated with other forms of power generation. We have fuel cells operating as microgrids at universities and municipalities, including one university microgrid owned by Clearway Energy and a municipal-based microgrid owned by UIL Holdings Corporation, in addition to the microgrid at a municipal location in Santa Rita, California. For the municipal-based system in Woodbridge, Connecticut owned by UIL Holdings Corporation, under normal operation, the fuel cell supplies power to the grid. If the grid is disrupted, the fuel cell plant will automatically disconnect from the grid and power a number of critical municipal buildings. Heat from this municipal-based fuel cell platform is used by the local high school. Our fuel cell based microgrids have also continued to operate during public safety power shutoffs events in California.
Levelized Cost of Energy
Our fuel cell projects deliver power at a rate comparable to pricing from the grid in our targeted markets. Policy programs that help to support adoption of clean distributed power generation often lead to below-grid pricing. We measure power costs by calculating the Levelized Cost of Energy (“LCOE”) over the life of the project. 

23




There are several primary elements to LCOE for our fuel cell projects, including:

• | Capital cost;
--+--------------


• | Operations and maintenance cost; and
--+-------------------------------------


• | Fuel expense.
--+--------------

Given the level of integration in our business model of manufacturing, installing and operating fuel cell power platforms, there are multiple areas and opportunities for cost reductions. We are actively managing and reducing costs in all three LCOE areas, including cost reduction initiatives with respect to system components and raw materials, advanced lean manufacturing principles, improvements in lifetime product costs through continued system and platform engineering, and improvements in output and efficiency. We are also investing in platform design to reduce overall EPC cost associated with the installation of our platforms.


Our Business Model
Our business model is based on multiple revenue streams, targeting both recurring revenue and non-recurring revenue. Recurring revenue is delivered through recurring electricity, capacity, and renewable energy credit sales under power purchase agreements (“PPAs”) and tariffs for projects we retain in our generation operating portfolio, as well as service revenue, mainly through long-term service agreements. Non-recurring revenue is generated through power platform and component sales, as well as from public and private industry research contracts related to the development of our Advanced Technologies (which are discussed in more detail below).
We are a complete solutions provider for our platform solutions, controlling the design, sales, manufacturing, installation, operations, and maintenance of our patented fuel cell technology under long-term power purchase and service agreements. When utilizing long-term PPAs, the end-user of the power or utility hosts the installation and only pays for power as it is delivered, avoiding up-front capital investment. We also develop projects and sell equipment directly to customers, providing a complete solution of engineering, installing, and servicing the fuel cell power plant under an engineering, procurement, and construction agreement (“EPC”) and a long-term maintenance and service agreement. (See the sections below entitled “Engineering, Procurement and Construction” and “Service and Warranty Agreements” for more information.) We maintain the long-term recurring service obligation and associated revenues running conterminous with the life of such projects.
Historically, in the United States, customers or developers typically purchased our fuel cell power plants outright.  As the size of our fuel cell projects has grown and the availability of project capital has improved, project structures in the U.S. have transitioned predominantly to PPAs. Customers and developers generally have the option to either purchase our fuel cell platforms outright or enter into a PPA under which the customer or developer (i.e. the end-user of the power) commits to purchase power as it is produced for an extended period of time, typically 10 to 20 years. We may elect to retain ownership of a project or we may elect to sell all or some of the project to a third party. If a project or project asset is sold, revenue from the sale is recognized and reflected in the Product revenues line item of our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, and we recognize revenue separately for the long-term maintenance and service agreement with respect to the project over the term of that agreement. If a project is retained, we recognize electricity, capacity and/or renewable energy credits monthly over the term of the PPA. We report the financial performance of retained projects as Generation revenues and Cost of generation revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 
Our decision to retain certain projects is based in part on the recurring, predictable cash flows these projects can offer us, the proliferation of PPAs in the industry and the potential access to capital.  Retaining PPAs affords us the full benefit of future cash flows under the PPAs, which are expected to be higher than if we sell the projects, although it requires more upfront capital investment and financing.  As of October 31, 2022, our operating portfolio of retained projects totaled 36.3 MW with an additional 26.8 MW under development or construction. We plan to continue to grow this portfolio prudently and in a balanced manner, while also selling projects to customers or project investors when selling presents the best value and opportunity for our capital needs or meets the customer’s desired ownership structure.
We operate and maintain our project platforms for the life of the project regardless of the ownership structure. For all operating fuel cell platforms not operating under a PPA, customers enter into long-term service agreements with us, some of which have terms of up to 20 years. We report the revenue earned under long-term maintenance and service agreements as Service agreements revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 

24




Internationally, South Korea and Europe have historically been product sale markets for the Company; however, prior to fiscal year 2022, we had not recognized meaningful product sales revenues in these geographies since 2018. Our activities in South Korea were impacted by our prior dispute with POSCO Energy and, until fiscal year 2021, we moderated our investment in business development in Europe due to limited resources. During fiscal year 2022, our commercial team renewed its sales efforts in both markets. Increasing product sales is a focus area for fiscal year 2023 and beyond. As a result of entering into a settlement agreement with POSCO Energy and its subsidiary, Korea Fuel Cell Co., Ltd. (“KFC”), on December 20, 2021 (the “Settlement Agreement”), we have confirmed our full access to the South Korean and broader Asian markets for sales of our products and we are aggressively pursuing sales in these markets, which we see as key to our future growth. (See the section below entitled “License Agreements— License Agreements and Settlement Agreement with POSCO Energy” for more information related to the terms of the Settlement Agreement.) 
​
Advanced Technologies Programs
Our Advanced Technologies programs include research and development and demonstration programs funded by third parties. We undertake both privately funded and publicly funded research and development to develop and grow these opportunities, reduce product and output costs, and expand our technology portfolio. Our Advanced Technologies programs are currently focused on developing and commercializing solutions that advance solid oxide fuel cells, distributed hydrogen, and carbon capture. We report the revenue earned under these programs as Advanced Technologies contract revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
​
We have historically worked on technology development with various U.S. government departments and agencies, including the DOE, the Department of Defense (“DOD”), the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (“DARPA”), the Office of Naval Research (“ONR”), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”). Government funding, principally from the DOE, provided 6%, 9% and 6% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 
​
We have been working with EMTEC since 2013 to develop and commercialize our carbon capture solution which is an application of our core carbonate technology. 
​
Beyond the DOE and EMTEC funding, we intend to prudently invest capital to accelerate commercialization of solid oxide fuel cells, carbon capture and separation, and long-duration energy storage solutions, as discussed below in more detail in the section entitled “Company Funded Research and Development”.

​
Company Funded Research and Development
In addition to research and development performed under research contracts, including, as described under the heading “Advanced Technologies Programs” above, we also fund our own research and development activities to support the commercial fleet with product enhancements and improvements. We work to continuously improve and mature our products and implement lessons learned into our product designs and manufacturing process subsequent to introduction. We also continue to invest in improvement initiatives with respect to our core molten carbonate technology. For example, we have identified improvement opportunities ranging from improved thermal management by reducing internal temperature to improving the performance of our electrical balance of plant and implemented design changes to our commercial platforms which are expected to improve overall product performance. 
As it relates to our fuel cell modules, these improvements center around delivering more uniform temperature distribution within the stack modules with the intent of improving output over the life of the modules to achieve the product’s expected design life. Continued extension of design life and output of our modules over time is a core research and development focus. In addition, we are also investing in commercializing technologies such as carbon capture and separation, solid oxide fuel cells, and solid oxide electrolysis cells for hydrogen production and energy storage as we believe these technologies represent significant future market opportunities. To further accelerate commercialization activity for our solid oxide platform, we commenced the design and construction of two advanced prototypes targeted for fiscal year 2023 completion: (i) a 250 kW power generation platform, and (ii) a 1 MW high-efficiency electrolysis platform.

25




Company funded research and development is included in Research and development expenses (operating expenses) in our consolidated financial statements. The total research and development expenditures in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, including third party and Company-funded expenditures, are as follows:

Manufacturing and Service Facilities
We operate a 167,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Torrington, Connecticut where we produce the individual cell packages and assemble fuel cell modules for our carbonate fuel cell products. This facility also houses our global service center. Our completed modules are conditioned in Torrington and shipped directly to customer sites. We continue to make investments in various manufacturing areas to improve production throughput and annualized production rate. As of October 31, 2022, the Torrington facility was operating at a 45 MW per year annualized production rate on a single production shift. Maximum annualized capacity (module manufacturing, final assembly, testing and conditioning) is 100 MW per year under the Torrington facility’s current configuration when being fully utilized. The Torrington facility is sized to accommodate the eventual annualized production capacity of up to 200 MW per year with additional capital investment in machinery, equipment, tooling and inventory. We continue to invest in manufacturing capability, including through the installation of new fuel cell conditioning equipment. Additionally, we expect to complete the construction of an on-site fuel cell demonstration and test unit in fiscal year 2023. This platform will allow for component testing, with the goal of accelerating the integration of alternate suppliers, and will allow prospective customers to observe demonstrated capabilities of the fuel cell platform, such as carbon separation.
We design and manufacture the core SureSource fuel cell components that are stacked on top of each other to build a fuel cell stack. For megawatt-scale power plants, four fuel cell stacks are combined to build a 1.4 MW fuel cell module. To complete the power platform, the fuel cell module or modules are combined with the balance of plant (“BOP”). The mechanical BOP processes the incoming fuel such as natural gas or biogas and includes various fuel handling and processing equipment such as pipes and blowers. The electrical BOP processes the power generated for use by the customer and includes electrical interface equipment such as an inverter. The BOP components are either purchased directly from suppliers or the manufacturing is outsourced based on our designs and specifications. This strategy allows us to leverage our manufacturing capacity, focusing on the critical aspects of the power plant where we have specialized knowledge and expertise and possess extensive intellectual property. BOP components are shipped directly to a project site and are then assembled with the fuel cell module into a complete power plant.

The Torrington production and service facility and the Danbury corporate headquarters and research and development facility are ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 certified and our Field Service operation (which maintains the installed fleet of our platforms) is ISO 9001:2015 certified, reinforcing the tenets of our quality management system and our core values of safety, continuous improvement, and commitment to quality, environmental stewardship, and customer satisfaction. Sustainability is promoted throughout our organization. We manufacture SureSource products and manage them through end-of-life using environmentally friendly business processes and practices, certified to ISO 14001:2015. We continually strive to improve how we plan and execute across the entire product life cycle. We maintain a chain of custody and responsibility of our SureSource products throughout the product life cycle and strive for “cradle-to-cradle” sustainable business practices, incorporating sustainability in our corporate culture. We utilize “Design for Environment” principles in the design, manufacture, installation and servicing of our power platforms. Design for Environment principles aim to reduce the overall human health and environmental impact of a product, process or service, when such impacts are considered across the product’s lifecycle. When our platforms reach the end of their useful lives, we can refurbish and re-use certain parts and then recycle most of what we cannot re-use. By weight, approximately 93% of the entire power plant can be re-used or recycled at the end of its useful life.
​
Our manufacturing and research and development facility in Calgary, Alberta, Canada is focused on the engineering and development of our solid oxide fuel cell (“SOFC”) and SOEC technologies. This facility also houses our SOFC and SOEC stack research and development effort and includes equipment for the manufacturing of solid oxide cells and stacks, including advanced manufacturing capabilities. We are making additional investment in the Calgary facility to establish a 

26




center of competence and excellence for solid oxide cell and stack research and manufacturing. This facility includes equipment for the manufacturing of solid oxide cells and stacks, including an advanced automated stack manufacturing line which has been developed to ensure that the labor and overhead which are required to produce these technologies are optimized for efficiency and complement the low direct material cost of the stack. As of October 31, 2022, this facility is capable of producing 1 MW per year of SOFC or approximately 4 MW per year of SOEC. We are investing in expanding this facility with the goal of increasing its production capacity to 10 MW per year of SOFC or 40 MW per year of SOEC, and we expect this expansion to be complete by the middle of fiscal year 2024. In parallel, we are also expanding our Connecticut manufacturing activities and evaluating additional U.S. locations in anticipation of increased production volume.
We have a manufacturing and service facility in Taufkirchen, Germany that has the capability to perform final module assembly for up to 20 MW per year of sub-megawatt fuel cell power platforms to service the European market. Our European service activities are also operated out of this location. Our operations in Europe are certified under both ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015. 
As we continue our focus on business growth in Europe, we plan to expand our existing manufacturing and assembly capabilities to match demand for our existing platforms and to support and fulfill the demand we expect to be associated with the future commercialization of our solid oxide and carbon capture offerings. We will continue to focus our manufacturing strategy on core strengths and competencies while further leveraging strategic outsourcing and supply partnering in support of increasing scale and speed to market.
In Asia, we previously relied on our relationship with POSCO Energy to serve the Asian market. Through that relationship, POSCO Energy manufactured the fuel cells to be used by customers in Asia, as well as operated and maintained fuel cell installations in the South Korean market. Now that we have entered into a settlement agreement with POSCO Energy, we plan to explore manufacturing and assembly opportunities across Asia to achieve more efficient product manufacturing and supply chain operations, as well as meet the increasing government requirements for the inclusion of locally sourced content and components in order to benefit from enhanced clean energy investment incentives.

​
​
Raw Material Sourcing and Supplier Relationships
We use various commercially available raw materials and components to construct a fuel cell module, including nickel and stainless steel, which are key inputs in our manufacturing process. Our fuel cell stack raw materials are sourced from multiple vendors and are not considered precious metals. We have a global integrated supply chain with qualified sources of supply, many of which are located locally in the regions in which we have established manufacturing and service operations including Europe and Asia. We have not sourced or procured, and do not source or procure, directly or indirectly, any materials from Russia. 
​
Despite a somewhat volatile nickel market and increased pricing pressure on stainless steel direct materials, we have employed strategic inventory purchases, negotiated fixed-price supply contracts, and employed financial hedges to help mitigate the impact to our product cost and improve financial planning. We have implemented several initiatives to mitigate the effect of impacts associated with extended lead times for materials and components by optimizing domestic supplier shipping volumes, leveraging competition across multiple qualified freight forwarders, establishing selective direct relationships with steamship lines, and aggregating shipments with qualified suppliers. 
​
From time to time, we may enter into over-the-counter financial hedges to mitigate market price volatility associated with our underlying physical commodity exposure (and other asset classes) consistent with our Financial Risk Management Policy. These hedges are non-speculative in nature, are entered into with investment grade-rated multinational financial institutions and are governed under the terms of the International Swaps and Derivative Association.
​
While we manufacture the fuel cells in our Torrington facility, the electrical and mechanical BOPs are assembled by and procured from several suppliers. All of our suppliers must undergo a stringent and rigorous qualification process. We continually evaluate and qualify new suppliers as we diversify our supplier base in our pursuit of lower costs, security of supply, and consistent quality. We purchase mechanical and electrical BOP components from third party vendors, based on our own proprietary designs.
​
Assuring the absence of conflict minerals in our power platforms is a continuing initiative. Our fuel cells, including the fuel cell components and completed fuel cell module, do not utilize any 3TG minerals (i.e., tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold) that are classified as conflict minerals. We utilize componentry in the BOP such as computer circuit boards that 

27




utilize trace amounts of 3TG minerals. For perspective, total shipments in fiscal year 2021 weighed approximately 4.6 million pounds, of which only 30.0 pounds, or 0.000667%, represented 3TG minerals, so the presence of these minerals is negligible. Our conflict mineral disclosure filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on Form SD contains specific information on the actions we are taking to avoid the use of conflict minerals.
Overall, as we continue to grow our business, we remain focused on improving quality, increasing the competitive supply landscape, maintaining existing supplier relationships, as well as building strong new key supplier relationships to expand our supply chain options.
​
Engineering, Procurement and Construction
We provide customers with complete turn-key solutions, including development, engineering, procurement, construction, interconnection and operations for our fuel cell projects. We have developed relationships with many design firms and licensed general contractors and have a repeatable, safe, and efficient execution philosophy that has been successfully demonstrated in numerous jurisdictions, both domestically and abroad, all with an exemplary safety record. The ability to rapidly and safely execute installations minimizes high-cost construction period financing and can assist customers in certain situations when the commercial operations date for a project is time sensitive.

​
Services and Warranty Agreements
We offer a comprehensive portfolio of services, including engineering, project management and installation, and long-term operating and maintenance programs, including trained technicians that remotely monitor and operate our platforms around the world, 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. We directly employ field technicians to service the power platforms and maintain service centers near our customers to support the high availability of our platforms. 
For all operating fuel cell platforms not under a PPA, customers purchase long-term service agreements (“LTSAs”), some of which have terms of up to 20 years. Pricing for LTSAs is based upon the value of service assurance and the markets in which we compete and includes all future maintenance and fuel cell module exchanges. Each model of our SureSource power platform has a target design life of 25-to-30 years. The fuel cell modules, with legacy modules having a 5-year target cell design life and current production modules having a 7-year target cell design life, go through periodic replacement, while the BOP systems, which consist of conventional mechanical and electrical equipment, are maintained over the life of the project.
Under the typical provisions of both our LTSAs and PPAs, we provide services to monitor, operate and maintain power platforms to meet specified performance levels. Operations and maintenance are key drivers for power platforms to deliver their projected revenue and cash flows. The service aspects of our business model provide a recurring and predictable revenue stream for the Company. We have committed future production for scheduled fuel cell module exchanges under LTSAs and PPAs through the year which have expiration dates through 2042. The pricing structure of the LTSAs incorporates these scheduled fuel cell module exchanges and the committed nature of this production facilitates our production planning. Many of our PPAs and LTSAs include guarantees for system performance, including electrical output and heat rate. Should the power platform not meet the minimum performance levels, we may be required to replace the fuel cell module with a new or used replacement module and/or pay performance penalties. Our goal is to optimize the power platforms to meet expected operating parameters throughout their contracted service terms.
In addition to our service agreements, we provide a warranty for our products against manufacturing or performance defects for a specific period of time. The warranty term in the U.S. is typically 15 months after shipment or 12 months after acceptance of our products. We accrue for estimated future warranty costs based on historical experience.

Competition
The market for clean energy is highly competitive. Many factors, including government incentives and specific market dynamics, affect how clean energy can deliver outcomes for customers in a given region. While clean energy often competes against the electric grid, which is readily available to prospective customers and supplied by traditional centralized power plants, including coal, gas, hydro, and nuclear plants, clean energy is increasingly able to compete with the grid and long-distance transmission of electricity in terms of levelized cost of electricity. Clean energy sources that 

28




customers may consider beyond our solutions include products such as wind turbines, solar arrays, and hydro facilities, as well as a range of hydrogen and fuel cell solutions from both incumbent and developing competitors.
Our platforms are based on a range of technologies and target a variety of applications, each of which have incumbent and developing competitors. Several companies in the U.S. are engaged in fuel cell development, although, to our knowledge, we are the only domestic company engaged in manufacturing and deployment of stationary natural gas or biogas fueled carbonate fuel cells. In addition to different types of stationary fuel cells, some other technologies that compete in the distributed generation marketplace include micro-turbines, turbines, and reciprocating gas engines.
Our stationary fuel cell platforms also compete against large scale solar and wind technologies, although we complement the unreliable intermittent nature of solar and wind power with the continuous, reliable power output of our fuel cells. Utility scale solar and wind power require specific geographies and weather profiles, transmission for utility-scale applications, and a source of back up capacity for when the sun or wind is not available. They also require a significant amount of land compared to our fuel cell power plants, making it difficult to site megawatt-class solar and wind projects in urban areas. While fuel cells emit negligible amounts of NOx, SOx and particulate matter, fuel cells do emit some carbon dioxide when fueled with natural gas or carbon-neutral biogas (although, while operating on biogas, the platform’s emissions would be considered carbon neutral), but in both cases less per kWh than other less-efficient systems. In many markets, baseload fuel cells avoid more emissions than wind or solar systems of similar capacity because they operate for many more hours of the day compared to these intermittent resources.
Product development cycles are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success. Research and development investments are crucial in this business, as are focused intellectual property strategies and protection of such, as new technologies and solutions could make our solutions less competitive. 
We continue to invest in exploring new ways of further improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our platforms. Our objective is to continue to improve our competitive position, including innovating in areas such as offering multiple platform solutions, and methods for producing clean hydrogen, solid oxide, and carbon separation and carbon capture in order to add value for customers looking for clean and renewable energy and to aid in their decarbonization goals.

Service and generation backlog as of October 31, 2022 had a weighted average term of approximately 17 years, with weighting based on dollar backlog and utility service contracts of up to 20 years in duration at inception. Generally, our government funded and privately funded research and development contracts are subject to the risk of termination at the convenience of the contract counterparty. 
​
Generation backlog is the largest component of our total commercial backlog, reflecting revenues from projects with PPAs in place and of which we have retained ownership. Under a PPA, the utility or end-user of the power (and other attributes such as capacity and renewable energy credits) commits to purchase power as it is produced for an extended period of time, typically 10-to-20 years. With the project being retained, electricity, capacity and/or renewable energy credits are recognized monthly over the term of the PPA. We report the financial performance of retained project assets as generation revenue and cost of generation revenues.
Our outstanding backlog is not indicative of amounts to be earned in the upcoming fiscal year. The specific elements of backlog may vary in terms of timing and revenue recognition from less than one year to up to 20 years. 
​
We may choose to sell or retain operating project assets on the balance sheet, thus creating variability in timing of revenue recognition. Accordingly, the timing and the nature of our business makes it difficult to predict what portion of our backlog will be filled in the next fiscal year.


License Agreements
License Agreement with EMTEC
EMTEC and FuelCell Energy began working together in 2016 under an initial joint development agreement with a focus on better understanding the fundamental science behind carbonate fuel cells for use in advanced applications and specifically how to increase efficiency in separating and concentrating carbon dioxide from the exhaust of natural gas-fueled power generation.
In June 2019, we entered into a license agreement with EMTEC to facilitate the further development of our SureSource CaptureTM product (the “EMTEC License Agreement”). Pursuant to the EMTEC License Agreement, we granted EMTEC and its affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid, perpetual, irrevocable, non-transferable license and right to use our patents, data, know-how, improvements, equipment designs, methods, processes and the like to the extent it is useful to research, develop and commercially exploit carbonate fuel cells in applications in which the fuel cells concentrate carbon dioxide from external industrial and power sources and for any other purpose attendant thereto or associated therewith, in exchange for a $10 million payment. Such right and license is sublicensable to third parties performing work for or with EMTEC or its affiliates but shall not otherwise be sublicensable. 
The EMTEC License Agreement facilitated the execution of the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement, pursuant to which we have engaged in exclusive research and development efforts with EMTEC to evaluate and develop new and/or improved carbonate fuel cells to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from industrial and power sources, in exchange for (a) payment of (i) an exclusivity and technology access fee of $5.0 million, (ii) up to $45.0 million for research and development efforts, and (iii) milestone-based payments of up to $10.0 million to be paid only if certain technological milestones are met (which had not been met as of October 31, 2021), and (b) certain licenses. 
Effective as of October 31, 2021, we and EMTEC agreed, among other things, to extend the term of the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement for an additional six months, ending on April 30, 2022. This extension allowed for the continuation of research intended to enable incorporation of design improvements to our fuel cell design in order to support a decision to use the improvements in a future demonstration of the technology for capturing carbon at ExxonMobil’s Rotterdam refinery in the Netherlands and provided additional time to achieve the first milestone under the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement.

​
Effective as of April 30, 2022, we and EMTEC agreed, among other things, to further extend the term of the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement for an additional eight months, ending on December 31, 2022 and to increase the maximum amount of research costs to be reimbursed by EMTEC from $45.0 million to $50.0 million. This extension to the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement allowed for the continuation of research intended to enable us and EMTEC to: (i) gain an improved understanding of the fuel cell operating envelope for various carbon capture applications; and (ii) complete data collection to support the project gate decision to use the developed technology in a Company fuel cell module

demonstration for capturing carbon at ExxonMobil’s Rotterdam facility. In addition, under this second extension, we and EMTEC agreed to conduct a joint market study, with a target completion date on or before October 31, 2022, to (a) define application opportunities, commercialization strategies, and development requirements, (b) identify partners for potential pilot/demonstration projects, and (c) assess fuel cell/stack/module manufacturing scale-up and cost reduction. As of October 31, 2022, we were still collaborating with EMTEC on the joint market study, which was completed in early fiscal year 2023.
​
On December 19, 2022, we and EMTEC agreed, effective as of December 1, 2022, to further extend the term of the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement such that it will end on August 31, 2023 (unless terminated earlier) and to further increase the maximum amount of research costs to be reimbursed by EMTEC from $50.0 million to $60.0 million. This extension to the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement is intended to (I) allow for continuation of research that would enable us and EMTEC to finalize data collection in support of the project gate decision to use the developed technology in a Company fuel cell module demonstration for capturing carbon at ExxonMobil’s Rotterdam facility, (II) allow for the continuation of the development, engineering and mechanical derisking of the Generation 2 Technology fuel cell module prototype, and (III) allow for studying the manufacturing scale-up and cost reduction of a commercial Generation 2 Technology fuel cell carbon capture facility.
License Agreements and Settlement Agreement with POSCO Energy
From approximately 2007 through 2015, we relied on POSCO Energy to develop and grow the South Korean and Asian markets for our products and services. 
Through June of 2020, we recorded license fees and were entitled to receive royalty income from POSCO Energy pursuant to manufacturing and technology transfer agreements entered into with POSCO Energy, including the Alliance Agreement dated February 7, 2007 (and amendments thereto), the Technology Transfer, License and Distribution Agreement dated February 7, 2007 (and amendments thereto), the Stack Technology Transfer and License Agreement dated October 27, 2009 (and amendments thereto), and the Cell Technology Transfer and License Agreement dated October 31, 2012 (and amendments thereto) (collectively, the “License Agreements”). The Cell Technology Transfer and License Agreement (“CTTA”) provided POSCO Energy with the exclusive technology rights to manufacture, sell, distribute and service our SureSource 300, SureSource 1500 and SureSource 3000 fuel cell technology in the South Korean and broader Asian markets. POSCO Energy built a cell manufacturing facility in Pohang, South Korea which became operational in late 2015, but is no longer operating.
In October 2016, the Company and POSCO Energy extended the terms of certain of the License Agreements to be consistent with the term of the CTTA, which was to expire on October 31, 2027. The CTTA required POSCO Energy to pay us a 3.0% royalty on POSCO Energy net product sales, as well as a royalty on scheduled fuel cell module replacements under service agreements for modules that were built by POSCO Energy and installed at plants in Asia under the terms of long-term service agreements (“LTSAs”) between POSCO Energy and its customers. Due to certain actions and inactions of POSCO Energy, we did not realize any new material revenues, royalties or new projects developed by POSCO Energy between late 2015 and January 2022, at which time we began to recognize revenues in connection with sales of replacement modules to a subsidiary of POSCO Energy. 
In November 2019, POSCO Energy spun-off its fuel cell business into a new entity, Korea Fuel Cell Co., Ltd. (“KFC”), without our consent. As part of the spin-off, POSCO Energy transferred manufacturing and service rights under the License Agreements to KFC, but retained distribution rights and severed its own liability under the License Agreements. We formally objected to POSCO Energy’s spin-off.
In February 2020 and March 2020, we notified POSCO Energy of its material breaches of the License Agreements and indicated that the License Agreements would be terminated if such breaches were not cured in a timely manner.
Between April 2020 and October 2020, POSCO Energy initiated a series of proceedings against us, including a series of three arbitration demands against us at the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce seated in Singapore in which it alleged certain warranty defects in a sub-megawatt conditioning facility at its facility in Pohang, South Korea.
​
In June 2020, we terminated the License Agreements and filed a demand for arbitration against POSCO Energy and KFC in the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. In October 2020, POSCO Energy filed a counterclaim in the arbitration.
We discontinued revenue recognition of the deferred license revenue related to the License Agreements in July 2020 given the then-pending arbitrations.

​
In order to resolve our disputes with POSCO Energy and KFC, on December 20, 2021, we entered into a Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with POSCO Energy and KFC (POSCO Energy and KFC may be collectively referred to herein as “PE Group”). The Settlement Agreement provides, among other things, that the parties will cooperate in good faith to effect a market transition to us of the molten carbonate fuel cell business in Korea in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement. To that end, the Settlement Agreement provides that any and all past, current, or potential disputes and claims between us, on the one hand, and POSCO Energy and KFC, on the other, of any nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown, asserted or not asserted, based on actions or omissions of any party on or before the date of Settlement Agreement are fully and finally settled, including such disputes and claims, directly or indirectly, in connection with the legal disputes and License Agreements described above, with the exception of (i) an unfiled claim by us in the amount of approximately $1.8 million with respect to certain royalties we believe are owed by POSCO Energy with respect to replacement modules deployed by POSCO Energy at Gyenonggi Green Energy and other sites for which POSCO Energy has not paid royalties, and (ii) an unfiled claim by POSCO Energy in an unknown amount with respect to a series of purchase orders for materials and components which began in 2014 under a supply chain contract, both of which claims remain unsettled. We do not believe the claim by POSCO Energy with respect to purchase orders for materials and components under the supply chain contract has merit and we retain the right to file a counterclaim for damages we believe we have incurred with respect to such supply chain contract. 
​
Under the Settlement Agreement, the parties also agreed that, within five days of the date thereof, we would withdraw our objection to the spin-off of KFC from POSCO Energy, and that the License Agreements are not terminated, but instead are deemed to be amended such that POSCO Energy and KFC only have the right (i) to provide maintenance and repair services to PE Group’s existing customers on existing molten carbonate power generation and thermal projects under LTSAs currently in force as well as LTSAs that have expired and are pending renewal as of the settlement date (collectively, “Existing LTSAs”), (ii) to supply replacement modules purchased from us only for their existing customers for existing molten carbonate power generation and thermal projects under Existing LTSAs and (iii) to own, operate and maintain all facilities and factories solely for the purposes set forth in (i) and (ii) above (collectively, the “Right to Service License”). POSCO Energy and KFC further agreed that, as of the date of the Settlement Agreement, the License Agreements were deemed to be amended such that we exclusively enjoy all rights as to our technology in Korea and Asia, other than the Right to Service License. The Settlement Agreement further provides that the License Agreements will terminate automatically upon sixty days prior written notice to PE Group if (i) we enter into a business collaboration agreement with a Korean company to construct, assemble, manufacture, market, sell, distribute, import, export, install, commission, service, maintain, or repair products incorporating our technology, or otherwise conduct our business, in the Korean market; or (ii) we expand the capacity of our existing Korean entity such as to perform such activities ourself. In the event of the termination of the License Agreements, the license granted to PE Group under the Right to Service License will continue notwithstanding the termination of the License Agreements, except that PE Group’s right to own, operate, and maintain all facilities and factories for the purpose of servicing any orders or requests made by us will terminate. For the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, PE Group has no right to manufacture modules or any other product incorporating our technology under the License Agreements as amended, the Right to Service License or otherwise unless requested and authorized by us to do so.

The Settlement Agreement further provides that, in order to service its existing customers under the Existing LTSAs, KFC would place a firm, non-cancelable order for twelve SureSource 3000 modules within two weeks after the date of the Settlement Agreement and an additional firm, non-cancelable order for eight SureSource 3000 modules on or before June 30, 2022, all at a price of $3.0 million per module. We received firm, non-cancelable orders from KFC for a total of twenty SureSource 3000 modules in fiscal year 2022. All of these modules were delivered Ex Works from our facility in Torrington, CT in fiscal year 2022.
​
In addition, KFC agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to order fourteen additional SureSource 3000 modules by December 31, 2022, at a price of $3.0 million per module if ordered by such date. KFC has indicated that it does not intend to order additional modules by December 31, 2022. 

Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, with respect to new modules supplied by us and deployed by PE Group to its existing customers, we will provide our standard warranty against module defects until the earlier of eighteen months from the date of shipment or twelve months from the date of installation. As part of the global settlement of the disputes among the parties and subject to the qualifications set forth in the Settlement Agreement, we will reimburse PE Group for any annual output penalty amount paid by PE Group to its customers pursuant to Existing LTSAs (whether such Existing LTSA is extended or renewed), caused by a shortfall or defect in the new modules for a period of up to seven years. The 

32




maximum annual reimbursement obligation with regard to any PE Group customer for any new module provided by us will not exceed an amount equal to 7.5% per year of the module purchase price. We will not be required to reimburse PE Group for any penalty paid by PE Group under the Existing LTSAs that is not caused by a shortfall or defect in the modules to be supplied by us including, without limitation, any shortfall or defect caused by a site-related problem, a problem with the balance of plant, or other components of the project.
​
Although we have the exclusive and unrestricted right under the Settlement Agreement to perform, pursue, and otherwise conduct our business in relation to new fuel cell projects (including new projects with PE Group’s existing customers) in Korea and Asia, the parties have agreed that, except as further provided in the Settlement Agreement with respect to PE Group’s existing customers Noeul Green Energy and Godeok Green Energy, we will not engage in discussions with PE Group’s existing customers regarding Existing LTSAs without PE Group’s consent. The parties have further agreed that if PE Group cannot enter into an agreement with its existing customers to extend or renew Existing LTSAs by December 31, 2022, PE Group will cooperate with us so that we may discuss and, at our sole discretion, enter into an extension of an Existing LTSA, a new LTSA to replace an Existing LTSA, or a module sales agreement with PE Group’s existing customers; provided that (i) should we enter into such an arrangement with a PE Group existing customer, and (ii) we are required to provide replacement modules to such existing customer under such arrangement, and (iii) PE Group has not already deployed all or some of the modules that PE Group ordered under the Settlement Agreement, we will purchase the number of required replacement modules from PE Group at a price of $3.0 million per module (to the extent such modules are available and have not yet been deployed). The purchase of such replacement modules by us is contingent upon the modules being in proper condition as determined by inspection process to be agreed to by the parties. Any modules purchased by us from PE Group under these terms will be included as part of the firm orders KFC is required to make pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.

With respect to operations and maintenance agreements, the Settlement Agreement provides that KFC will have the right of first refusal on providing operation and maintenance services on commercially reasonable terms for new LTSAs entered into by us in Korea for a period of the first to occur of either twenty-four months after the date of the Settlement Agreement or until such time as we engage a third party capable of providing such services in Korea. If we and KFC agree that KFC should provide operation and maintenance services pursuant to the right of first refusal, we and KFC will enter into one or more operation and maintenance agreements that reflect commercially reasonable terms and conditions as agreed by us and KFC at that time.

With respect to BOP, KFC currently has eight units of BOP available, and the Settlement Agreement provides that we have the option to purchase such units of BOP for any new molten carbonate fuel cell projects within Korea at a price of KRW 2,550,000,000 per unit (or USD $1,787,550 per unit as of October 31, 2022). We will also have a non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable license to use the intellectual property imbedded in the BOP units in Korea in consideration for a reasonable license fee to be separately agreed by the parties. Detailed terms and conditions of BOP and related software and firmware supply will be discussed and agreed to in good faith in separate BOP supply agreements in the event we exercise our option to purchase any of such BOP.

Regulatory and Legislative Environment
Distributed generation differs from central generation. As such, it is subject to a separate set of legal standards as well as legislative and regulatory policies. The policies that affect our products are not always the same as those imposed on other companies, or the products of other companies, that produce power, and while some policies may make our products less competitive, others may provide an advantage. Certain utility policies may also pose barriers to our installation or interconnection with the utility grid, such as backup, standby or departing load charges that make installation of our products less economically attractive for our customers. Regulatory and legislative support can take the form of policy, incentive programs, and defined sustainability initiatives such as Renewable Portfolio Standards (“RPS”).
United States
Various states and municipalities in the U.S. have adopted programs for which our products qualify, including programs supporting self-generation, clean air power generation, combined heat and power applications, carbon reduction, grid resiliency/microgrids, energy storage and utility ownership of fuel cell projects.
​
Many states in the U.S. have enacted legislation adopting Clean Energy Standards (“CES”) or RPS mechanisms. Under these standards, regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total electricity sales to end-user customers from eligible resources according to a set schedule. CES and RPS, and their 

33




implementing regulations, vary significantly from state to state, particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state’s mandate, the definition of eligible clean and renewable energy resources, and the extent to which renewable energy credits (certificates representing the generation of renewable energy) qualify for CES or RPS compliance. Fuel cells using biogas qualify as renewable power generation technology in all of the CES and RPS states in the U.S., and some states specify that fuel cells operating on natural gas are also eligible for these initiatives in recognition of the high efficiency and low pollutants of fuel cells. Most states are introducing legislation or regulations that seek to reduce the consumption of electricity generated using fossil fuels in favor of zero carbon resources. Additionally, utility regulators are looking for non-wire alternatives to build reliability and resiliency to the grid, which also presents a potential opportunity.
​
In February 2018, the U.S. Congress reinstated the 30% Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) for fuel cells and extended and significantly expanded the existing Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit. The ITC phased down to 26% in 2020 and was scheduled to phase down to 22% by 2022 and expire in 2023. The reinstatement of the ITC for fuel cells provided equal access to tax incentives for U.S. fuel cell manufacturers when compared to other clean energy solutions. The ITC phase down was extended by two years pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 passed by Congress in December 2020 and signed by the President on December 27, 2020, thus extending the 26% ITC until 2022 and the expiration to 2025.
 ​
Since that time, two pieces of federal legislation have been passed by the U.S. Congress that are expected to have a significant impact on our business model. First, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, passed and signed into law during the fall of 2021, allocated over $8 billion for hydrogen-related activity and research, including a hubs initiative to be administered by the DOE. These hydrogen hubs have spurred unprecedented activity across the U.S. to organize networks of hydrogen production, distribution, and consumption in an effort to attract federal matching funds available under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. We believe that state-level activity to attract hydrogen hub dollars has created new forums in which we can demonstrate how our existing and future hydrogen-producing solutions can be a part of future hydrogen hubs and economies. 
​
Secondly and more recently, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”), signed into law on August 16, 2022, marked a major investment by the U.S. federal government into a broad spectrum of renewable energy technologies by recasting existing investment and production tax credits and creating new credits for zero-emission technology. The IRA extends the existing Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 48 investment tax credit, which includes fuel cell technology, through 2024 and introduces new prevailing wage conditions required to be eligible for the full credit value. Beyond this change, we could benefit from changes to the production credit pursuant to IRC Section 45Q related to carbon capture and sequestration, the new investment tax credit pursuant to IRC Section 48E for zero emission energy property which will succeed the existing Section 48 ITC, and the IRC Section 45V production tax credit for hydrogen. This new production credit offers up to $3.00 per kilogram of hydrogen produced if the hydrogen is considered zero carbon and if the hydrogen generation project conforms with prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. Such an incentive for zero carbon could result in increased demand for commercial solutions to hydrogen production technology, such as our solid oxide electrolyzer which is currently under development and available for order. Many of the modified or new tax credits also include additional credits for using domestically sourced content and for siting projects in specified “energy communities” where fossil fuel production previously has been a significant economic driver. We expect to be well positioned to take advantage of the credit adder for domestic content.
​
Overall, we believe that the IRA’s passage signals a significant effort by the U.S. federal government to accelerate low- and no-carbon energy production and manufacturing. We believe that the programs and credits included in the IRA align well with our business model and could provide significant benefits with respect to incentivizing the purchase of our current product offerings and technologies under commercial development.
South Korea
Internationally, South Korea has an RPS to promote clean energy, reduce carbon emissions, and develop local manufacturing of clean energy generation products to accelerate economic growth. The RPS is designed to increase new and renewable power generation to 10% of total power generation by 2023 from 2% when the RPS began in 2012. Twenty-two of the largest power generators are obligated to achieve the RPS requirements in their generation or purchase offsetting renewable energy certificates. Financial penalties are levied by the government for non-compliance. 
European Union
European governments are supportive of hydrogen-based generation and efficient CHP applications. Italy adopted a system to promote energy efficiency with Italian “White Certificates” (Energy Efficiency Certificates) that are tradable 

34




certificates, for which fuel cells qualify, to promote energy savings expressed in tons of oil equivalent saved. Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands provide tax incentives, grants and waivers of regulatory fees for clean energy installations. Additionally, large energy-intensive industry sectors and the aviation sector in European Union countries above a certain size qualify for the ETS (Emissions Trading Scheme) and are subject to a cap-and-trade requirement for carbon emissions.
In the European Union (“EU”), the Emissions Trading System (“ETS”) has created carbon capture sequestration allowances to be applied to ETS calculations for carbon not released into the atmosphere, and instead placed into a storage location for future use. Similar credits are allowed for entities that capture CO2 emissions to produce precipitated calcium carbonate, in which the used CO2 is chemically bound. The European Union is anticipated to develop a standard to be able to classify when CO2 has been “stored” by the end of 2022. We believe that these developments, along with legislation recently passed by the EU Parliament leading to the creation of the European Hydrogen Bank funded with 3 billion euros, will provide market support for carbon capture technologies.
In response to the hardships and global energy market disruption caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the European Commission presented the REPowerEU Plan.
REPowerEU is a plan for:


● | saving energy,
--+---------------


● | producing clean energy, and
--+----------------------------


● | diversifying the EU’s energy supplies.
--+---------------------------------------

​
The REPowerEU Plan is backed by financial and legal measures to build the new energy infrastructure and system that Europe needs. In addition to the construction of a hydrogen backbone by 2030, REPowerEU calls for 6 gigawatts (“GW”) of electrolysis by 2024 and 30 GW by 2030. 
South Africa
South African legislation requires the transition from 90% coal-generated electricity to a system that is transparent, equitable, and incorporative of renewable energy and alternative sources. The governments of South Africa, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the U.S., along with the European Union, have announced an ambitious, long-term Just Energy Transition Partnership (the “Partnership”) to support South Africa’s decarbonization efforts. The Partnership aims to accelerate the decarbonization of South Africa’s economy, with a focus on the electricity system, to help it achieve the ambitious goals set out in its updated Nationally Determined Contribution emissions goals. This Partnership mobilizes an initial commitment of $8.5 billion for the first phase of financing, through various mechanisms including grants, concessional loans and investments and risk sharing instruments, including to mobilize the private sector.
​
Government Regulation
Our Company and our products are subject to various federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, land use, safe working conditions, handling and disposal of hazardous and potentially hazardous substances and emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. Emissions of SOx and NOx from our power plants are substantially lower than conventional combustion-based generating stations and are far below existing and proposed regulatory limits. The primary emissions from our power plants, assuming no cogeneration application, are humid flue gas that is discharged at temperatures of 700-800° F, water that is discharged at temperatures of 10-20° F above ambient air temperatures, and CO2 in per-kW hour amounts that are, due to the high efficiency of fuel cells, significantly less than conventional fossil fuel central generation power plants. Depending on the jurisdiction, whether our plants require water discharge permits is dependent upon whether the discharge is directed to a storm drain or wastewater system.
We are also subject to federal, state, provincial and/or local regulation with respect to, among other things, siting. Furthermore, utility companies and several states in the U.S. have created and adopted, or are in the process of creating and adopting, interconnection regulations covering both technical and financial requirements for the interconnection of fuel cell power plants to utility grids. Our power plants are designed to meet all applicable laws, regulations and industry standards for use in the international markets in which we operate. Our SureSource solutions are California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) 2007 certified, and our SureSource 1500 and SureSource 3000, when operating on biogas, are certified for the CARB 2013 Biogas standard.

Proprietary Rights and Licensed Technology
Our intellectual property consists of patents, trade secrets, institutional knowledge and know-how that we believe is a competitive advantage and represents a barrier to entry for potential competitors. We have extensive experience in designing, manufacturing, operating and maintaining fuel cell power plants. This experience cannot be easily or quickly replicated and, combined with our trade secrets, proprietary processes and patents, safeguards our intellectual property rights.
​
As of October 31, 2022, we (excluding our subsidiaries) had 129 U.S. patents and 251 patents in other jurisdictions covering our fuel cell technology (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions), with patents directed to various aspects of our SureSource technology, SOFC technology, PEM fuel cell technology and applications thereof. As of October 31, 2022, we also had 40 patent applications pending in the U.S. and 107 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions. 
​
As of October 31, 2022, our subsidiary, Versa Power Systems, Ltd. (“Versa”), had 29 U.S. patents and 87 international patents covering SOFC technology (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions). As of October 31, 2022, Versa also had 7 pending U.S. patent applications and 21 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions. In addition, as of October 31, 2022, our subsidiary, FuelCell Energy Solutions, GmbH, had license rights to 2 U.S. patents and 7 patents outside the U.S. (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions) for carbonate fuel cell technology licensed from Fraunhofer IKTS.
We continue to innovate, and no patent expiration, either individually or in the aggregate, is expected to have any material impact on our current or anticipated operations.
​
Certain of our U.S. patents are the result of government-funded research and development programs, including our DOE programs. U.S. patents we own that resulted from government-funded research are subject to the government potentially exercising “march-in” rights. We believe that the likelihood of the U.S. government exercising these rights is remote and would only occur if we ceased our commercialization efforts and there was a compelling national need to use the patents.
​
Significant Customers and Information about Geographic Areas
We contract with a concentrated number of customers for the sale of our products and for research and development. For the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our top customers, KFC, Connecticut Light and Power, EMTEC, KOSPO, the DOE, LIPA, Pfizer, Inc., and UIL Holdings Corporation accounted for an aggregate of 87%, 79% and 80%, respectively, of our total annual consolidated revenue.

See Item 7 – “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8 – “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further information regarding our revenue and revenue recognition policies.
​
We have marketing and manufacturing operations both within and outside the United States. We source raw materials and BOP components from a diverse global supply chain. In fiscal year 2022, the foreign country with the greatest concentration risk was South Korea, accounting for 52% of our consolidated net revenues. While we plan to aggressively pursue sales of our products in South Korea as a result of the Settlement Agreement with POSCO Energy and KFC, we 

36




are also in the process of diversifying our sales mix from both a customer specific and geographic perspective as part of our overall strategic plan.
​
The international nature of our operations subjects us to a number of risks, including fluctuations in exchange rates, adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements and tariffs, taxes, and other trade restrictions. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” – “We are subject to risks inherent in international operations.” See also Note 13. “Segment Information,” to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about our net sales by geographic region for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. See also Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for other information about our operations and activities in various geographic regions.

We increased our diverse team member population by 5% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021.
Compensation and Benefits
​
As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive compensation and benefit programs for all of our team members in order to attract and retain superior and diverse talent. In addition to competitive base wages, additional programs include an annual Management Incentive Plan, Long-Term Equity Incentive Plans, and a Company matched 401(k) Plan.
​
For plan year 2023, we have joined a captive health insurance group to keep healthcare costs neutral. We have also implemented a wellness program for employees that includes health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, team member assistance programs and a flexible hybrid work environment.
​
Workforce Environmental Health and Safety
We take workplace jobsite safety and environmental compliance very seriously. Under our robust environmental, health and safety (EH&S) program, we strongly encourage the reporting of near misses to identify opportunities for improvement and we are constantly evaluating our EH&S protocols in an effort to keep our facilities and workspaces environmentally friendly and safe for our team members, stakeholders, customers, and visitors. 
​
We are committed to EH&S excellence. Our Environmental Management System is certified to ISO 14001:2015, and our Occupational Health & Safety Management System is certified to ISO 45001:2018. Health and safety is both a bottom-up and top-down priority as the Company’s Board of Directors is actively engaged in ongoing review of our polices, protocols and performance.
​
Our EH&S core principles are: 

● | Zero injuries / incidents;
--+---------------------------


● | Compliance with all legal obligations;
--+---------------------------------------


● | Pollution prevention;
--+----------------------


● | Waste reduction; and
--+---------------------


● | Continual improvement.
--+-----------------------

​
We are also in the process of performing life cycle analyses on our products, as well as our production and office locations, and developing a roadmap to net zero carbon emissions.

Our safety performance is excellent and is demonstrated by experience modification rates (EMR) below the industry average of 1.0 for the last 7 fiscal years: 2016: 0.81, 2017: 0.65, 2018: 0.62, 2019: 0.65, 2020: 0.59, 2021: 0.68 and 2022: 0.088. We have maintained an “A” rating since 2016 providing “Safety Tier 1” performance with ISNetworld, a database for online contractor safety management designed to streamline companies' and contractors' compliance pre-qualification processes. Because EH&S compliance is a priority for us, we also leverage ISNetworld to qualify contractors that work on our projects.

Critical Assumptions and Additional Information Regarding Calculation of our Total Addressable Market Opportunity
The following information should be read in conjunction with the information under the heading “Our Market Opportunity” above.
Total Addressable Market Assumptions:
Our estimate for the combined, cumulative TAM in the Measuring Period with respect to the global markets that may be served by our carbon capture solution (which is under development) and carbon separation and carbon utilization solutions (which are currently available) is based, in part, on review and analysis of the International Energy Agency CCUS in Clean Energy Transitions Report (September 2020), Morgan Stanley Carbon Capture Report (April 2021) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (October 2018), and is further based on third party estimates of global market demand for purchased CO2 for the food and beverage, enhanced oil recovery and other industrial gas usage markets and global markets for avoided CO2 as it relates to carbon taxation. Our ability to participate in the carbon capture market assumes that we can commercialize our carbon capture technologies within the internal time frames assumed by our management. Our ability to participate in the carbon capture market, which represents a significant portion of the estimated $1 trillion TAM for carbon capture, carbon separation and utilization, also assumes that EMTEC, which funds some of our research into carbon capture and which owns certain intellectual property rights related to the carbon capture technology under development by us, will provide us with the necessary licenses or will otherwise allow us to commercially exploit carbon capture technology outside of capturing CO2 generated by our own platforms (for which we do not require a license from EMTEC). There can be no assurance that we will be successful in commercializing carbon capture technology or, in the event we are successful in developing carbon capture technology to the point of commercial availability, that EMTEC would provide us with necessary licenses or otherwise allow us to exploit carbon capture intellectual property owned by EMTEC which would be necessary for us to sell carbon capture technology for applications not involving carbon capture from our own platforms. Reference to a global market for carbon capture, carbon separation and utilization also assumes that we can create the necessary business infrastructure to manufacture, market, sell, install and service such solutions globally, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in creating such business infrastructure. 
Our estimate for the combined, cumulative TAM in the Measuring Period with respect to the global markets that may be served by our distributed hydrogen solutions is based, in part, on review and analysis of the BloombergNEF, Hydrogen Economy Outlook (March 2020) and Hydrogen Council, Hydrogen Insights (July 2021). Our estimate of the total cumulative TAM for distributed hydrogen includes the markets for grey hydrogen (hydrogen derived from natural gas), blue hydrogen (hydrogen derived from natural gas but with the management of CO2 through carbon capture and storage) and green hydrogen (hydrogen created from renewable sources such as wind and solar power). Reference to a global market for distributed hydrogen also assumes that we can create the necessary business infrastructure to manufacture, market, sell, install and service such solutions globally, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in creating such business infrastructure. 
Our estimate for the combined, cumulative TAM in the Measuring Period with respect to the markets that may be served by our megawatt and sub-megawatt FTM and BTM distributed power solutions is based, in part, on review and analysis of Morgan Stanley equity research (July 2020), MarketLine data research (Q1 2019) and Wells Fargo equity research (April 2021). Our estimate is based on markets in the United States, South Korea and Western Europe, which represent our largest current markets for FTM and BTM distributed power solutions and are markets in which we have an installed base of distributed power solutions. 
Our estimate for the combined, cumulative TAM with respect to the global markets that may be served by the solid oxide based long-duration hydrogen energy storage and electrolysis solutions under development by the Company is based, in part, on review and analysis of BloombergNEF, Long-Term Storage Outlook 2020, Wood Mackenzie, Power & 

38




Renewables (April 2021) and Guidehouse Insights, Market Data: Utility-Scale Energy Storage Market Update (Q1 2022). Reference to a global market for solid oxide based long-duration hydrogen energy storage and electrolysis solutions assumes that we can successfully commercialize this technology within the internal time frame assumed by our management and create the necessary business infrastructure to manufacture, market, sell, install and service such solutions globally. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in commercializing solid oxide based long-duration hydrogen energy storage and electrolysis solutions or, in the event we are successful in commercializing such solutions, that we will be successful in creating the necessary business infrastructure described above.
