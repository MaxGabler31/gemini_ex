General
 
GSG Group Inc. (formerly known as Wike Corp.) (“the Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 11, 2014. Initially we were a development-stage company in a business of printing on ornamental ribbons. Our initial office was located at Via Lodovico Berti, 40131, Bologna, Italy.
 
On April 6, 2017, Corina Safaler, the Company’s former Director and CEO, completed a transaction with Wentao Zhao, by which Mr. Zhao acquired 4,500,000 shares of common stock, representing 74% ownership of the Company. On the same date, the shareholders of the Company voted Sreyneang Jin as Director and CEO, and Gim Hooi Ooi as CFO. The new management decided to cease the existing business of printing ornamental ribbons and explore new business plan that will generate sufficient cash flows and profits to the Company. The Company has leased a new office at 18/F Canadia Bank Tower, No. 315, Ang Doung St, Corner Monivong Blve, Phnom Penh, Cambodia for future business.
 
On August 17, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company approved that the Company changed its name to GSG Group Inc. and the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State. The name change was approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) on September 15, 2017. 
 
Product
 
Originally, our products included ribbons, notebooks, plastic items and other printed goods of that kind, where we specialized mostly on ribbons printing.
 
Following the change of control and management on April 6, 2017 the Company ceased the existing business and started exploring new businesses to generate revenue. 
 
Target market
 
Operating from our Cambodia head office, management has begun moving into the business consulting space for inbound Cambodia investors and local businesses. From our presence on the ground in Cambodia, we are exposed to and increasingly connected to the local business world and in an excellent position to identify special opportunities and demand for goods or services.
 
Potential target areas are in the tourism industry, real estate development and general public and private infrastructure as well as in telecoms, technology and transportation.

Industry analysis
 
Due to the long time relative political isolation and, following the more open approach to inbound investments since about 5-7 years, the much increased interest from neighboring countries in Asia, but also internationally, Cambodia sees good growth rates and substantial momentum, specifically in the areas just mentioned above in our target markets. The relative investment backlog combined with increased trust in the Cambodian government and ministries makes for a very good general business environment we intend to profit from. 
 
Marketing
 
We are marketing our services mostly on a mouth to mouth basis, which is possible due to our long built network to all relevant business owners, industry leaders and decision makers locally. We intend to increase our online presences and to utilize alternative marketing tools in the future to further increase our exposure and recognition with our target clients.
 
We believe that our marketing campaign shall attract many clients and develop a strong reputation of quality, diligent and efficient service provider. Hopefully, our clients will continue to readily recommend us to others.
 
Competition
 
The level of competition in our target line of business is still lower than in other further developed countries and we rely on our targeted performance benchmarks in result driven, competent consulting that we can offer at a competitive fee level due to our still lean structure and organization. 
Insurance
 
We do not maintain any insurance, but will decide on a case by case basis if professional indemnity cover would be advisable, depending largely on the size and subject matter of our advisory mandates. If we were made a party of a products liability action and, in the case would not have arranged for insurance cover, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.
Employees
 
We are a development stage company and currently have no employees, other than our officers and directors. 
 
Offices
 
The phone number is +85523962303. The office is located at 18/F Canadia Bank Tower, No. 315, Ang Doung St, Corner Monivong Blve, Phnom Penh, Cambodia. 
 
Government Regulation
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to consulting firms and operation of any facility in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business. We do not need to receive any government approvals necessary to conduct our business; however we will have to comply with all applicable export and import regulations.
