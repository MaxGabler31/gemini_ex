Item 1. Business.
Overview



Aeluma develops novel optoelectronic devices for sensing and communications applications. Aeluma has pioneered a technique to manufacture devices using high performance compound semiconductor materials on large diameter silicon wafers that are commonly used to manufacture mass market microelectronics. This enables cost effective manufacturing of high performance photodetector array circuits for imaging applications in mobile devices. This technology has the potential to enhance the performance and capability of camera image sensors, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), AR/VR (augmented reality/virtual reality), facial recognition, and other applications.
Corporate Structure



We were incorporated as Parc Investments, Inc. in the State of Delaware on August 21, 2020. Prior to the Merger (as defined below), we were a “shell company” (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)).



On June 22, 2021, our board of directors and all of our pre-Merger stockholders approved a restated certificate of incorporation, which was effective upon its filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on June 22, 2021 and through which we changed our name to “Aeluma, Inc.” On June 22, 2021, our board of directors also adopted restated bylaws.



On June 22, 2021, Biond Photonics, Inc., a privately held California corporation (“Biond Photonics”) merged with and into our wholly owned subsidiary, Aeluma Operating Co., a corporation formed in the State of Delaware on June 22, 2021 (“Acquisition Sub”). Pursuant to this transaction (the “Merger”), Acquisition Sub was the surviving corporation and remained our wholly owned subsidiary, and all of the outstanding stock of Biond Photonics was converted into shares of our common stock.



As a result of the Merger, we acquired the business of Biond Photonics and will continue the existing business operations of Biond Photonics as a public reporting company under the name Aeluma, Inc.



In accordance with “reverse merger” or “reverse acquisition” accounting treatment, our historical financial statements as of period ends, and for periods ended, prior to the Merger were replaced with the historical financial statements of Biond Photonics prior to the Merger, in all the filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). 



Our Business



We develop novel optoelectronic devices for sensing and communications applications. Aeluma has pioneered a technique to manufacture devices using high performance compound semiconductor materials on large diameter silicon wafers that are commonly used to manufacture mass market microelectronics. This enables cost effective manufacturing of high performance photodetector array circuits for imaging applications in mobile devices. These devices may be used as image sensors that generate an image by detecting light, in a manner similar to a digital camera taking pictures. Our devices may incorporate additional functionality for 3D image capture when integrated into various system architectures. This technology has the potential to enhance the performance and capability of camera image sensors, LiDAR, AR/VR, facial recognition, and other applications. Aeluma has acquired a key piece of manufacturing equipment and has its headquarters in Goleta, CA with a manufacturing cleanroom to operate this equipment.



Because we will leverage compound semiconductor materials including indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs), our devices may operate out to longer wavelengths, up to at least 1,600 nm, which is advantageous for a number of reasons including eye safety. Beyond 1,400 nm is considered eye safe at significantly higher optical power levels relative to that at shorter wavelengths. Therefore, for LiDAR sensing systems, the range (the detectable object distance) can be increased significantly. Operating at specific longer wavelengths (for example, near 1,550 nm) also enables imaging both in low light (dark) conditions, as well as in direct sunlight. Therefore, images could be captured outdoors and in various conditions.

Our Strategy



Aeluma will continue to develop its technology that includes novel materials and devices based on those novel materials. Our primary focus is to manufacture high performance photodetector array circuits for image sensors. Initial efforts aim to penetrate the 3D imaging and sensing (mobile and consumer, defense and aerospace, industrial, medical, auto) and LiDAR (robotic vehicles, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), topography, wind, industrial) markets. As we are currently operating in a research and development (R&D) phase, we do not have any commercial products at this time.
Our Technology



Our technology is based on heterogeneous integration of compound semiconductor materials on silicon. This heterogeneous integration enables the subsequent device fabrication and manufacturing in silicon manufacturing environments that are suited to large-volume production. Manufacturing on silicon also enables unique device configurations that are either not possible, challenging, or cost prohibitive relative to manufacturing on traditional compound semiconductor substrates.
Competition



There are two primary classes of image sensors currently in the market: low-cost silicon sensors for mass market applications, and high performance InGaAs sensors deployed primarily in specialty applications. The major suppliers of silicon CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) image sensors include Sony, Samsung, Omnivision, On Semi, STM, Panasonic, Canon, SK Hynix, and others (Source: Yole Development, www.yole.fr). The major suppliers of InGaAs sensors include Hamamatsu, Sumitomo, FLIR/Teledyne, Princeton Lightwave/Argo AI, Sensors Unlimited, Excelitas, and others (Source: Markets and Markets, www.marketsandmarkets.com).



We believe that our technology will be able to compete effectively because we are uniquely positioned to outperform silicon CMOS image sensors while achieving a cost of manufacturing that is lower than that for traditional InGaAs sensors. Compared to silicon, InGaAs demonstrates higher detection sensitivity and a broader wavelength absorption spectrum. Silicon absorbs or detects light in the visible spectral region (400-750 nm) and partially in the near infrared (NIR) spectral region (greater than 750 nm), cutting off near 940 nm. InGaAs not only demonstrates higher absorption in the visible and NIR, but also extends well into the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectrum (1,000-2,500 nm), cutting off near 1,700 nm, with the ability to extend beyond 2,000 nm using strained InGaAs material.



We believe that we are also positioned to win on price in competing with current InGaAs sensors while having the ability to realize much larger area photodetector arrays because of our ability to manufacture on up to 12-inch silicon wafers, whereas competing InGaAs photodetectors are manufactured on indium phosphide (InP) wafers that are typically 2-4 inches in size. Therefore, in addition to realizing many more sensor chips per wafer, we have the ability to realize array sizes that are larger than what is possible with traditional InGaAs manufacturing on InP wafers.



Existing and potential competitors have or could have advantages such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, broader and deeper product portfolios, larger customer bases, substantially greater financial and other resources, and larger scale manufacturing operations. However, we believe that our products will have the potential to compete because of our unique ability to manufacture high performance devices at low cost.



Customers



Aeluma does not currently have customers. We have, however, engaged with potential customers that wish to procure materials or sensor devices. Aeluma’s technology is broadly applicable. Potential markets include automotive LiDAR, industrial LiDAR, robotics, mobile, communications, defense and aerospace. Our current strategy is to pursue partnerships with system integrators, including LiDAR companies and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, or semiconductor manufacturing companies. Aeluma is also pursuing direct sales relationships.

Markets



The CMOS image sensors market was approximately $19 billion in 2020 and is projected to be $30 billion in 2026 (Source: Yole Development). During 2018, the revenue breakdown by market was 68% mobile, 7% consumer, 8% computing, 6% automotive, 6% security, 3% industrial, 1% medical, 1% defense and aerospace (Source: Yole Development, CMOS Image Sensor Industry 2020 report, www.yole.fr).



In terms of total market unit sales, the following are projected for 2024: 1.73 billion mobile phones, 131 million tablets, and 113 automotive vehicles (Source: www.idc.com). Manufacturers of mobile phones, tablets, and LiDAR for automotive vehicles may be prospective customers for Aeluma. In the mobile market, Apple arguably leads in terms of deploying advanced capabilities such as LiDAR sensing in their devices; Apple does not use our technology. Apple leverages VCSEL (vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser) emitters in conjunction with SPAD (single-photon avalanche diode) detectors for a LiDAR scanner in smartphones and tablets and such technology “helps to deliver faster, more realistic augmented reality experiences and improves autofocus in low-light scenes in photos and videos” (https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-awards-an-additional-410-million-from-its-advanced-manufacturing-fund-to-ii-vi/). Other major smartphone suppliers include Samsung, Xiaomi, OPPO, vivo, Huawei, and realme (Source: www.counterpointresearch.com).



In addition to smartphone and tablet, other image sensor markets include: defense and aerospace, industrial, medical, automotive, robotic vehicles, machine vision, camera, motion detection, smart building and people counting, military, thermal imaging (Source: Yole Development).



Research and development will be key to our success, enabling us to differentiate from competitors. The goal of our research and development efforts is to maintain leadership in heterogeneous integration of compound semiconductors on silicon for scaling the manufacturing of high performance optoelectronic devices. To support research and development, we will pursue government funded programs, although there are no assurances that such programs will be awarded. Such programs could not only offset research and development costs, but should provide pathways to customers, thereby supporting commercialization efforts.



Intellectual Property



Aeluma has filed five patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). We have filed trademarks for the name “Aeluma” and the slogan “Sensing Reimagined” with the USPTO. We maintain protection of trade secrets that include “know-how” and process recipes.
Our Intellectual Property Approach



Our strategy for the protection of our proprietary technology is to seek worldwide patent protection with a focus on jurisdictions that represent significant global semiconductor markets. However, we will assess on a case-by-case basis whether it is strategically more favorable to maintain trade secret protection for our inventions and “know-how” rather than pursue patent protection. Generally, patents have a term of twenty years from the earliest priority date, assuming that all maintenance fees are paid, no portion of the patent has been terminally disclaimed and the patent has not been invalidated. In certain jurisdictions, and in certain circumstances, patent terms can be extended or shortened.
Governmental & Environmental Regulations



Our primary products are anticipated to be compound semiconductor optoelectronic devices manufactured on silicon substrates, including InGaAs photodetectors and photodetector arrays. To the extent that our products are or become subject to U.S. export controls and regulations, these regulations may limit the export of our products and technology, and provision of our services outside of the United States, or may require export authorizations, including by license, a license exception, or other appropriate government authorizations and conditions, including annual or semi-annual reporting. Export control and economic sanctions laws may also include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain of our products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, regions, governments, persons, and entities. In addition, various countries regulate the importation of certain products, through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products. The exportation, re-exportation, and importation of our products and technology and the provision of services, including by our partners, must comply with these laws or else we may be adversely affected, through reputational harm, government investigations, penalties, and a denial or curtailment of our ability to export our products and technology. Complying with export control and sanctions laws may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Although we take precautions to prevent our products and technology from being provided in violation of such laws, our products and technology may have previously been, and could in the future be, provided inadvertently in violation of such laws, despite the precautions we take. If we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control laws, it could result in substantial fines and penalties for us and for the individuals working for us. Export or import laws or sanctions policies are subject to rapid change and have been the subject of recent U.S. and non-U.S. government actions. Changes in export or import laws or sanctions policies, may adversely impact our operations, delay the introduction and sale of our products in international markets, or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products and technology to certain countries, regions, governments, persons, or entities altogether, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We seek to comply with all applicable statutory and administrative requirements concerning environmental quality. Expenditures for compliance with federal state and local environmental laws have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.



In addition, to the extent that our facilities and operations are or become subject to the plant and laboratory safety requirements of various environmental and occupational safety and health laws in the U.S. we believe we are in compliance with all such laws and regulations, and to date, those regulations have not materially restricted or impeded operations. Further, we believe our processes to be highly efficient, generating very low levels of waste and emissions. For this reason, we do not view issues surrounding climate change and any currently foreseeable related regulations as materially impacting our business and financial statements, beyond any inestimable impact on the macro-economic environment.



We are also generally subject to other industry and environmental regulations for electronic and semiconductor products such as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC.



Manufacturing



We have established a manufacturing and R&D facility at our headquarters in Goleta, CA. We have installed key equipment and we plan to control our core materials manufacturing and development. In addition to our facility, we work with a variety of vendors and are establishing relationships with industrial foundries to build out our manufacturing supply chain.
Sales



We currently do not have revenue or sales contracts.



Marketing



Marketing activities include direct relationships with potential customers and partners. We are under nondisclosure agreement (NDA) with a number of potential customers and partners, several of which have either visited Aeluma or hosted a visit by Aeluma representatives at their sites.
Employees



Aeluma currently has nine employees, eight that are full time and one that is part time. The majority of employees work in engineering. One employee supports business development. We plan to hire additional persons on an as-needed basis. On a case by case basis, Aeluma may offer stock options to employees for attraction and retention.
Legal Proceedings



There is no material litigation, arbitration, governmental proceeding or any other legal proceeding currently pending or known to be contemplated against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such, and we and the members of our management team have not been subject to any such proceeding in the 10 years preceding the date of this report. We may however be involved, from time to time, in claims and lawsuits incidental to the conduct of our business in the ordinary course. We carry insurance coverage in such amounts as we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and that may or may not cover any or all of our liabilities in respect of these matters. We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations, but cannot guarantee same.
