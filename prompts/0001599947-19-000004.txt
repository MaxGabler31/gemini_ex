Item 1. Business.
Overview
TerraForm Power, Inc. (“TerraForm Power” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) acquires, owns and operates solar and wind assets in North America and Western Europe. We are the owner and operator of a 3,738 MW diversified portfolio of high-quality solar and wind assets underpinned by long-term contracts. Significant diversity across technologies and locations coupled with contracts across a large, diverse group of creditworthy counterparties significantly reduces the impact of resource variability on cash available for distribution and limits our exposure to any individual counterparty. We are sponsored by Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (“Brookfield”), a leading global alternative asset manager with over $350 billion in assets under management. Affiliates of Brookfield held approximately 65% of TerraForm Power’s Class A common stock as of December 31, 2018.
TerraForm Power’s objective is to deliver an attractive risk-adjusted return to its stockholders. We expect to generate this total return with a regular dividend, which we intend to grow at 5 to 8% per annum, that is backed by stable cash flows.
TerraForm Power is a holding company and its primary asset is an equity interest in TerraForm Power, LLC (“Terra LLC”). TerraForm Power is the managing member of Terra LLC and operates, controls and consolidates the business affairs of Terra LLC. Unless otherwise indicated or otherwise required by the context, references to “we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company” refer to TerraForm Power and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Our principal executive offices are located at 200 Liberty Street, 14th Floor, New York, New York 10281, and our telephone number is 646-992-2400. Our website address is www.terraformpower.com.

Our Business Strategy
Our primary business strategy is to acquire, own and operate solar and wind assets in North America and Western Europe. We are the owner and operator of a 3,738 MW diversified portfolio of high-quality solar and wind assets, underpinned by long-term contracts. Significant diversity across technologies and locations coupled with contracts across a large, diverse group of creditworthy counterparties significantly reduces the impact of resource variability on cash available for distribution and limits our exposure to any individual counterparty. We are sponsored by Brookfield.
Our goal is to pay dividends to our stockholders that are sustainable on a long-term basis while retaining within our operations sufficient liquidity for recurring growth capital expenditures and general purposes. We expect to generate this return with a regular dividend, which we intend to grow at 5 to 8% per annum, that is supported by a target payout ratio of 80 to 85% of cash available for distribution and our stable cash flows. We expect to achieve this growth and deliver returns by focusing on the following initiatives:

• | Value-Oriented Acquisitions:

We focus on sourcing off-market transactions at more attractive valuations than auction processes. Our successful acquisition of Saeta provides us with a European Platform and is an example of one such opportunity. We believe that multi-faceted transactions such as take-privates and recapitalizations may enable us to acquire high quality assets at attractive relative values.
We have a right of first offer (“ROFO”) to acquire certain renewable power assets in North America and Western Europe owned by Brookfield and its affiliates. The ROFO portfolio currently stands at approximately 3,500 MW. Over time, as Brookfield entities look to sell these assets, we will have the opportunity to make offers for these assets and potentially purchase them if the proposed price (i) meets our investment objectives, and (ii) is the most favorable offered to Brookfield and the applicable Brookfield entities receive all necessary approvals from their independent directors and institutional partners. We also continue to maintain a call right over 500 MW (net) of operating wind power plants that are owned by a warehouse vehicle that was owned and arranged by our previous sponsor, SunEdison, who sold its equity interest in this warehouse vehicle to an unaffiliated third party in 2017.

• | Margin Enhancements:

We believe there is significant opportunity to enhance our cash flow through optimizing the performance of our existing assets. As our recently announced long-term service agreements (collectively, the “LTSA”) with an affiliate of General Electric demonstrate, such agreements have the potential to lock in cost savings, provide contractual incentives for achieving our generation targets and increase revenue through deployment of technology. We are currently seeking to execute similar agreements to optimize the performance of our North American solar and European wind fleets.

• | Organic Growth:

We continue to develop a robust organic growth pipeline comprised of opportunities to invest in our existing fleet on an accretive basis as well as add-on acquisitions across our scope of operations. We have identified a number of investment opportunities which we believe may be compelling, including asset repowerings, site expansions and adding energy storage to existing sites.
We benefit from Brookfield’s deep operational expertise in owning, operating and developing renewable assets, as well as its significant deal sourcing capabilities and access to capital. Brookfield is a leading global alternative asset manager and has a more than 100-year history of owning and operating assets with a focus on renewable power, property, infrastructure and private equity. Brookfield has approximately $350 billion of assets under management of which $47 billion are renewable power assets. This renewable power portfolio represents approximately 17,400 MW of generation capacity in 15 countries. It also employs over 2,500 individuals with extensive operating, development and power marketing capabilities and has a demonstrated ability to deploy capital in a disciplined manner, having developed or acquired 13,200 MW of renewable generation capacity since 2012.

Sponsorship Arrangements
On October 16, 2017, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orion Holdings merged with TerraForm Power (the “Merger”), with TerraForm Power continuing as the surviving corporation. In connection with the consummation of the Merger, TerraForm Power entered into the following suite of support and sponsorship arrangements (the “Sponsorship Transaction”) with Brookfield and certain of its affiliates:

• | Master Services Agreement (the “Brookfield MSA”), with Brookfield, BRP Energy Group L.P., Brookfield Asset Management Private Institutional Capital Adviser (Canada), L.P., Brookfield Global Renewable Energy Advisor Limited, Terra LLC and Terra Operating LLC, pursuant to which Brookfield and certain of its affiliates provide certain management and administrative services, including the provision of strategic and investment management services, to TerraForm Power and its subsidiaries.


• | Relationship Agreement (the “Relationship Agreement”) with Brookfield, Terra LLC and Terra Operating LLC, which governs certain aspects of the relationship between Brookfield and TerraForm Power and its subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Relationship Agreement, during the term of the agreement, TerraForm Power and its subsidiaries serve as the primary vehicle through which Brookfield and its affiliates will acquire operating solar and wind assets in certain countries in North America and Western Europe, and Brookfield grants TerraForm Power a right of first offer on any proposed transfer of certain existing projects and all future operating solar and wind projects located in such countries developed by, persons sponsored by or under the control of Brookfield, subject to certain exceptions and consent rights set out therein. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. Risks Related to our Relationship with Brookfield.


• | Governance Agreement (the “Governance Agreement”) with Orion Holdings and any controlled affiliate of Brookfield (other than TerraForm Power and its controlled affiliates) (such controlled affiliates together with Brookfield, the “Sponsor Group”) that by the terms of the Governance Agreement from time to time becomes a party thereto. The Governance Agreement establishes certain rights and obligations of TerraForm Power and members of the Sponsor Group that own voting securities of TerraForm Power relating to the governance of TerraForm Power and the relationship between such members of the Sponsor Group and TerraForm Power and its controlled affiliates.

Terra LLC is also party to an amended and restated limited liability company agreement with Brookfield IDR Holder and a $500.0 million sponsor line of credit with Brookfield and one of its affiliates as discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. See also a discussion of the IDRs in Incentive Distribution Rights within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Corporate Governance and Management
We have a single class of shares outstanding worth one vote each. The size of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) is currently set at seven members, of whom four are designated by Brookfield and three are independent. Under the terms of the Sponsorship Transaction, Brookfield appoints our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel. These three executive officers are not employees of the Company and their services are provided pursuant to the Brookfield MSA.
Our Board has established an Audit Committee and a Conflicts Committee, each consisting entirely of our independent directors. The Conflicts Committee considers, among other things, matters in which a conflict of interest exists between our Company and Brookfield. Our Board has also established a Nominating and Governance Committee, which consists of three directors, one of whom is a director designated by Brookfield and two of whom are independent directors.

Seasonality and Resource Availability
The amount of electricity produced and revenues generated by our solar generation facilities is dependent in part on the amount of sunlight, or irradiation, where the assets are located. As shorter daylight hours in winter months result in less irradiation, the electricity generated by these facilities will vary depending on the season. Irradiation can also be variable at a particular location from period to period due to weather or other meteorological patterns, which can affect operating results. As the majority of our solar power plants are located in the Northern Hemisphere, we expect our solar portfolio’s power generation to be at its lowest during the first and fourth quarters of each year. Therefore, we expect our first and fourth quarter solar revenue to be lower than in other quarters.
Similarly, the electricity produced and revenues generated by our wind power plants depend heavily on wind conditions, which are variable and difficult to predict. Operating results for wind power plants vary significantly from period to period depending on the wind conditions during the periods in question. As our wind power plants are located in geographies with different profiles, there is some flattening of the seasonal variability associated with each individual wind power plant’s generation, and we expect that as the fleet expands the effect of such wind resource variability may be favorably impacted, although we cannot guarantee that we will purchase wind power facilities that will achieve such results in part or at all. Historically, our wind production has been greater in the first and fourth quarters which can partially offset any lower solar revenues in those quarters.
We do not expect seasonality to have a material effect on our ability to pay a regular dividend. We intend to mitigate the effects of any seasonality that we experience by reserving a portion of our cash available for distribution and otherwise maintain sufficient liquidity in order to, among other things, facilitate the payment of dividends to our stockholders. 
Competition
Power generation is a capital-intensive business with numerous industry participants. We compete to acquire new renewable energy facilities with renewable energy developers, independent power producers, financial investors and certain utilities. We compete to supply energy to our potential customers with utilities and other providers of distributed generation. We compete with other renewable energy developers, independent power producers, financial investors, utilities and other providers of distributed generation based on our cost of capital, development expertise, pipeline, global footprint and brand 
13

reputation. To the extent we re-contract renewable energy facilities upon termination of a PPA or sell electricity into the merchant power market, we compete with traditional utilities and other independent power producers primarily based on cost of capital, asset location, the feasibility of customer sited generation, operations and management expertise, price (including predictability of price), the ability to monetize green attributes (such as RECs and tax incentives) of renewable power and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our renewable energy facilities. In our merchant power sales, we also compete with other types of generation resources, including gas and coal-fired power plants.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we own and operate renewable energy facilities. These laws and regulations generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained and maintained both before construction and during operation of these renewable energy facilities. We incur costs in the ordinary course of business to comply with these laws, regulations and permit requirements. We do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental compliance for our renewable energy facilities in the next several years. While we do not expect that the costs of compliance would generally have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, it is possible that as the size of our portfolio grows we may become subject to new or modified regulatory regimes that may impose unanticipated requirements on our business as a whole that were not anticipated with respect to any individual renewable energy facility. Additionally, environmental laws and regulations frequently change and often become more stringent, or subject to more stringent interpretation or enforcement, and therefore future changes could require us to incur materially higher costs which could have a material negative impact on our financial performance or results of operations.
Regulatory Matters
United States
All of the renewable energy facilities located in the United States that we own are qualifying small power production facilities (“QFs”) as defined under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended (“PURPA”) or Exempt Wholesale Generators (“EWGs”) as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, as amended (“PUHCA”). As a result, they and their upstream owners are exempt from the books and records access provisions of PUHCA, and most are exempt from state organizational and financial regulation of electric utilities. Depending upon the power production capacity of the renewable energy facility in question, our QFs and their immediate project company owners may be entitled to various exemptions from ratemaking and certain other regulatory provisions of the Federal Power Act, as amended (“FPA”).
All of the renewable energy facility companies that we own outside of the United States are Foreign Utility Companies, as defined in PUHCA. They are exempt from state organizational and financial regulation of electric utilities and from most provisions of PUHCA and FPA.
We own a number of renewable energy facilities in the United States that are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), and that have obtained “market based rate authorization” and associated blanket authorizations and waivers from FERC pursuant to the FPA, which allows such facilities to sell electricity, capacity and ancillary services at wholesale or negotiated market based rates, instead of cost-of-service rates, as well as waivers of, and blanket authorizations under, certain FERC regulations that are commonly granted to market based rate sellers. FERC requires market based rate holders to make additional filings upon certain triggering events in order to maintain market based rate authority. The failure to make timely filings can result in revocation or suspension of market based rate authority, refunds of revenues previously collected and the imposition of civil penalties.
Under Section 203 of the FPA (“FPA Section 203”), prior authorization by FERC is generally required for any direct or indirect acquisition of control over, or merger or consolidation with, a “public utility,” facilities subject to FPA jurisdiction,
or in certain circumstances an “electric utility company,” as such terms are used for purposes of FPA Section 203. All of our renewable energy facilities that sell their output at wholesale in the continental U.S. (except in Texas) and our subsidiary Evergreen Gen Lead, LLC (which owns electric transmission facilities), are public utilities, and all are electric utility companies (including those in Texas) for the purposes of FPA Section 203. FERC generally presumes that the acquisition of direct or indirect voting power of 10% or more in an entity results in a change in control of such entity. Transfers of transmission facilities associated with our electric generation facilities or the whole of any such generation facility could also trigger the need to obtain prior approval from FERC under FPA Section 203. Violation of FPA Section 203 can result in civil or criminal liability under the FPA, including civil penalties, and the possible imposition of other sanctions by FERC. Depending upon the circumstances, liability for violation of FPA Section 203 may attach to a public utility, the parent holding company of a public utility or an electric utility company, or to an acquirer of the voting securities of such holding company or its public utility or electric utility company subsidiaries. 
14

Certain of our renewable energy facilities are also subject to compliance with the mandatory Reliability Standards promulgated and enforced by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (“NERC”) and approved by FERC. Violation of such Reliability Standards can result in civil penalties or other enforcement measures to ensure compliance under the FPA assessed to the owners and/or operators of such renewable energy facilities. In the United Kingdom, Canada, Chile, Uruguay, Portugal and Spain, the Company is also generally subject to the regulations of the relevant energy regulatory agencies applicable to all producers of electricity under the relevant feed-in tariff or other governmental incentive programs (collectively “FIT”) (including the FIT rates); however, it is generally not subject to regulation as a traditional public utility, i.e., regulation of our financial organization and rates other than FIT rates.
As the size of our portfolio grows, or as applicable rules and regulations evolve, we may become subject to new or modified regulatory regimes that may impose unanticipated requirements on its business as a whole that were not anticipated with respect to any individual renewable energy facility. For example, the NERC Reliability Standards approved by FERC impose fleetwide cyber security requirements regarding electronic and physical access to generating facilities in order to protect system reliability; such requirements expand in scope after the point at which a single owner has more than 1,500 MW of reliability assets under its control in a single connection and expand again once the owner has more than 3,000 MW under construction. Such future changes in our regulatory status or the makeup of our fleet could require it to incur materially higher costs which could have a material adverse impact on its financial performance or results of operations. Similarly, although we are not currently subject to regulation as an electric utility in the foreign markets in which we provide our renewable energy services, our regulatory position in these markets could change in the future. Any local, state, federal or international regulations could place significant restrictions on our ability to operate our business and execute our business plan by prohibiting or otherwise restricting the sale of electricity by us. If we were deemed to be subject to the same state, federal or foreign regulatory authorities as traditional utility companies, or if new regulatory bodies were established to oversee the renewable energy industry in the United States or in our foreign markets, our operating costs could materially increase, adversely affecting our results of operations.
Spain
The legal framework applicable to the renewable energy facilities located in Spain includes the following laws and ministerial orders promulgated thereunder:

• | Royal Decree-Law 9/2013, dated July 12, 2013 (the “Royal Decree-Law 9/2013”), containing emergency measures to guarantee the financial stability of the electricity system;


• | Law 24/2013, dated December 26, 2013 (the “Electricity Act”); and


• | Royal Decree 413/2014, dated June 6, 2014 (the “Royal Decree 413/2014”), regulating electricity production from renewable energy sources.

The Electricity Act recognizes some rights for producers with facilities that use renewable energy sources, such as priority in access to offtakers and transmission and distribution networks and entitlement to the recovery of certain costs. Under the Electricity Act, renewable energy electricity producers are required to offer to sell their energy through the market operator, to maintain the plant’s planned production capacity (including power lines connecting to transmission or distribution networks) and to contract and pay fees to transmission and distribution companies in order for their power to be fed into the grid.
The Electricity Act and Royal Decree 413/2014 require electricity generation facilities to be entered on the official register of electricity production plants maintained by the Ministry for the Ecological Transition. To receive cost reimbursement, renewable energy facilities are required under the Electricity Act and Royal Decree 413/2014 to be listed on a new register entitled the Specific Payment System Register, Registro de Regimen Retributivo Especifico. Unregistered plants will only receive the pool price.
Royal Decree-Law 9/2013 introduced a change in the payment system applicable to new and existing electricity production facilities using renewable energy sources to guarantee the financial stability of the electric system. The purpose of Royal Decree-Law 9/2013, which became effective on July 14, 2013, was to adopt a series of measures to ensure the stability of the electric system and to combat the shortfalls between electricity system revenues and costs, referred to as the tariff deficit. Royal Decree-Law 9/2013 established an entirely new remuneration system, abolishing the remuneration system based on a regulated tariff applicable to electricity production facilities using renewable energy sources (including facilities in operation at the time that Royal Decree-Law 9/2013 became effective).
Prior to the adoption of Royal Decree-Law 9/2013, electricity production facilities using renewable energy sources received a feed-in tariff tied to their electricity produced according to their power output. According to Royal Decree 413/2014, producers receive: (i) the pool price for the power they produce and (ii) a payment based on the standard investment cost for 
15

each type of plant (which is not tied to the amount of power they generate). This payment, based on investment (in €/MW of installed capacity), is supplemented (in cases of technologies with running costs in excess of the pool price) with an operating payment (in €/MWh produced).
Government Incentives and Legislation
Each of the countries in which we operate has established various incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of renewable energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar and wind energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, favorable tax treatment and depreciation, rebates, RECs or green certificates, net energy metering programs, feed-in tariffs and other incentives. These incentives help catalyze private sector investments in renewable energy and efficiency measures. Changes in the government incentives in each of these jurisdictions could have a material impact on our financial performance.
United States
Federal government support for renewable energy
The U.S. federal government provides an investment tax credit that allows a taxpayer to claim a credit of 30% of qualified expenditures for a solar generation facility. The U.S. government’s enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) did not make any changes to the existing laws surrounding tax credits for renewable energy. The ITC is currently scheduled to be reduced to 26% for solar generation facility construction that begins on or after January 1, 2020 and to 22% for solar generation facility construction that begins on or after January 1, 2021. A permanent 10% ITC is available for non-residential solar generation facility construction that begins on or after January 1, 2022. 
Certain wind facilities are eligible for production tax credits, which are federal income tax credits based on the quantity of renewable energy produced and sold during the first ten years of production, or ITCs in lieu of PTCs. These credits are available only for wind power plants that began construction on or prior to December 31, 2019 but are reduced over time. The wind PTCs (and ITC in lieu of PTC) are 100% (of the amount otherwise available) in the case of a facility for which construction began by December 31, 2016, 80% (of the amount otherwise available) in the case of any facility for which construction began in 2017, 60% (of the amount otherwise available) in the case of a facility for which construction begins in 2018, and 40% (of the amount otherwise available) in the case of a facility for which construction begins in 2019. ITCs, PTCs and accelerated tax depreciation benefits generated by constructing and operating renewable energy facilities can be monetized by entering into tax equity financing agreements with investors that can utilize the tax benefits, which have been a key financing tool for renewable energy facilities. Based on our portfolio of assets, we will benefit from the ITC, PTC and an accelerated tax depreciation schedule, and we will rely on financing structures that monetize a substantial portion of these benefits and provide financing for our renewable energy facilities.
U.S. state government support for renewable energy

Many states offer a personal and/or corporate investment or production tax credit for renewable energy facilities, which is in addition to the ITC or PTCs. Further, more than half of the states, and many local jurisdictions, have established property tax incentives for renewable energy facilities that include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits. Certain of our renewable energy facilities in the U.S. have been financed with a tax equity financing structure, whereby the tax equity investor is a member holding equity in the limited liability company that directly or indirectly owns the solar generation facility or wind power plant and receives the benefits of various tax credits.
Many state governments, utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer a rebate or other cash incentive for the installation and operation of a renewable energy facility. Capital costs or “up-front” rebates provide funds based on the cost, size or expected production of a customer’s renewable energy facility. Performance-based incentives provide cash payments to a system owner based on the energy generated by their renewable energy facility during a pre-determined period, and they are paid over that time period. Some states also have established FIT programs that are a type of performance-based incentive where the system owner-producer is paid a set rate for the electricity their system generates over a set period of time.
A majority of states have a regulatory policy known as net metering. Net metering typically allows our customers to interconnect their on-site solar generation facilities to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit at the utility’s retail rate for energy generated by their solar generation facility that is exported to the grid. At the end of the billing period, the customer simply pays for the net energy used or receives a credit at the retail rate if more energy is 
16

produced than consumed. Some states require utilities to provide net metering to their customers until the total generating capacity of net metered systems exceeds a set percentage of the utilities’ aggregate customer peak demand.
Many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production. There are 29 states that have adopted a renewable portfolio standard (“RPS”) that requires regulated utilities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the state from eligible renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power generation facilities, by a specified date. To prove compliance with such mandates, utilities must procure and retire RECs. System owners often are able to sell RECs to utilities directly or in REC markets.
U.S. Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, (i) reducing the U.S. federal corporate rate from 35% to 21%; (ii) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings (where applicable) of foreign subsidiaries; (iii) generally eliminating the U.S. federal income tax on dividends received from foreign subsidiaries; (iv) requiring current inclusion in the U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations; (v) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) and changing how existing AMT credits may be realized; (vi) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax, a new minimum tax; (vii) creating a new limitation on the deductible interest expense; and (viii) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The federal corporate tax rate reduction is expected to have a favorable impact on our business but this favorable impact is expected to be offset by a more or less equal negative impact of the interest expense deduction and loss carryforward limitations. The other measures of the Tax Act are not expected to significantly impact our current portfolio.
International
The international markets in which we operate or may operate in the future also typically have in place regimes to promote renewable energy. These mechanisms vary from country to country. Our objective is to grow our dividend through the growth of our portfolio in North America and Western Europe. In seeking to achieve this growth, we may make investments, like our investment in Saeta, that to some extent rely on governmental incentives in international jurisdictions. 
In Spain, under Royal Decree 413/2014, renewable electricity producers receive the merchant price for the power they produce and a return on investment payment per MW of installed capacity. For solar plants, there is an additional return on operations payment per MWh produced. This program is intended to allow renewable energy producers to recover development costs and obtain a reasonable rate of return on investment. The reasonable return is calculated as the average yield on Spanish government 10-year bonds on the secondary market in a 24-month period preceding the new regulatory period, plus a premium based on the financial condition of the Spanish electricity system and prevailing economic conditions. The amount of the return is recalculated at the end of each six-year regulatory period. The first regulatory period began on July 14, 2013, and will end on December 31, 2019. The Spanish government initiated its review of the rates of return on investment and operations with the publication of a draft law on December 28, 2018. The next regulatory period will begin on January 1, 2020. 
In Canada, our portfolio of operating renewable assets is located in the province of Ontario, which has historically sought to increase the contribution of renewables in the supply mix by offering long-term contracts with government-owned entities through competitive requests for proposals or feed-in tariffs. The recent change in government in Ontario makes it unlikely that historic levels of support for renewables will be sustained in the near term.
In Portugal, there are feed-in tariff contracts that fix payment terms for the duration of the contract. For contracts awarded in 2006 and 2007, the contract term is 15 years. During the European Union bailout following the financial crisis of 2008, the Portuguese government sought to raise funds to reduce its electricity tariff deficit by offering wind generators the option to extend their initial regulatory life in return for upfront payment. The extension is for an additional 7 years with a cap-and-floor price following expiry of the feed-in-tariff. Incentives are also in place for repowering existing capacity at a lower rate.
In Uruguay, we benefit from a government promoted concession agreement and a long-term PPA with UTE - Administracion Nacional de Usinas y Transmisiones Electricas, the Republic of Uruguay’s state-owned electricity company. Under this PPA, we are required to deliver power at a fixed rate for the contract period, in all cases inflation adjusted.

Business Segments
We have three reportable segments: (i) Solar, (ii) Wind and (iii) Regulated Solar and Wind. These segments, which constitute the Company’s entire portfolio of renewable energy facilities have been determined based on the management approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the reportable segments. Our reportable segments are comprised of operating segments. An operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, and that has discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision makers in deciding how to allocate resources. Portugal Wind, Uruguay Wind, and the Regulated Spanish Solar and Wind segments are new operating segments that were added during the second quarter of 2018, and include all of Saeta’s operations. Consequently, the Company’s operating segments consist of: (i) Distributed Generation, North America Utility and International Utility, which are aggregated into the Solar reportable segment, (ii) Northeast Wind, Central Wind, Texas Wind, Hawaii Wind, Portugal Wind and Uruguay Wind operating segments, which are aggregated into the Wind reportable segment, and (iii) the Regulated Spanish Solar and Wind operating segments, which are aggregated within the Regulated Solar and Wind reportable segment. These operating segments have been aggregated into reportable segments as they have similar economic characteristics and meet all applicable aggregation criteria. We also have corporate expenses which include general and administrative expenses, acquisition costs, interest expense on corporate-level indebtedness, stock-based compensation and depreciation, accretion and amortization expense. All net operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were earned by our reportable segments from external customers in the United States (including Puerto Rico), Canada, Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and Chile. 
Customer Concentration
For the year ended December 31, 2018, TerraForm Power earned an aggregate of $186.7 million from the Spanish Electricity System, including $127.9 million from the Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (“CMNC”), which represented 16.7% of our 2018 consolidated operating revenues. The role of the CMNC is to collect funds payable, mainly from the tariffs to end user customers, and is responsible for the calculation and the settlement of regulated payments. We believe this concentration risk is mitigated by, among other things, the indirect support of the Spanish government for the CNMC’s obligations and for the regulated rate system more generally. Other than the CMNC in Spain, there is no other single customer from which we generated more than 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. In California, where a portion of our solar generation fleet is located, we generated certain revenues from three public utilities located in the state. These three public utilities, in aggregate, accounted for approximately 13.6% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 177 full-time employees, the majority of whom were located in the United States. The governance agreements entered into between the Company and Brookfield in connection with the Merger and Sponsorship Transaction provide for Brookfield to appoint our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel. These three executive officers are not employees of the Company and their services are provided pursuant to the Brookfield MSA.
Health, Safety, Security & Environment
We promote a culture of health, safety, security and environmental leadership. We strive to achieve excellence in safety performance and to be recognized as an industry leader in accident prevention. Our overall objective is to incur zero high risk safety incidents and zero lost time injuries. We have adopted a Health, Safety, Security and Environmental (“HSS&E”) policy that includes a framework for oversight, compliance, compliance audits and the sharing of best practices both within our operations and with other affiliates of Brookfield. We maintain an HSS&E Steering Committee and require all employees, contractors, agents and others involved in our operations to comply with our established HSS&E practices.
