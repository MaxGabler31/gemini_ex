Item 1.       Business
General

EQT Corporation (EQT or the Company) conducts its business through five business segments: EQT Production, EQM Gathering, EQM Transmission, RMP Gathering and RMP Water. EQT Production is the leading natural gas producer in the United States, based on average daily sales volumes, with 21.4 Tcfe of proved natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves across approximately 4.0 million gross acres, including approximately 1.1 million gross acres in the Marcellus play, many of which have associated deep Utica or Upper Devonian drilling rights, and approximately 0.1 million gross acres in the Ohio Utica as of December 31, 2017. EQM Gathering and EQM Transmission provide gathering, transmission and storage services for the Company’s produced gas, as well as for independent third parties across the Appalachian Basin through EQT Midstream Partners, LP (EQM) (NYSE: EQM), a publicly traded limited partnership formed by EQT to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream assets in the Appalachian Basin. RMP Gathering provides natural gas gathering services to the Company in the dry gas core of the Marcellus Shale in southwestern Pennsylvania,through Rice Midstream Partners LP (RMP) (NYSE: RMP). RMP Water provides water services that support well completion activities and collects and recycles or disposes of flowback and produced water for the Company and third parties in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania and Belmont County, Ohio also through RMP.
On November 13, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Rice Energy Inc. (Rice) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 19, 2017 (as amended, the Merger Agreement), by and among the Company, Rice and a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company (Merger Sub). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on November 13, 2017, Merger Sub merged with and into Rice (the Rice Merger) with Rice continuing as the surviving corporation in the Rice Merger. Immediately after the effective time of the Rice Merger (the Effective Time), Rice was merged with and into another wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company.
The Company acquired a total of approximately 270,000 net acres through the Rice Merger, which includes approximately 205,000 net Marcellus acres, as well as approximately 65,000 net Utica acres in Ohio. The Company also acquired Upper Devonian and Utica drilling rights held in Pennsylvania. In addition, the Company acquired a 28% limited partner interest, all of the incentive distribution rights (IDRs) and the entire non-economic general partner interest in RMP, as well as certain retained gathering assets located in Belmont and Monroe Counties, Ohio (the Rice retained gathering assets). See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Rice Merger.
In 2015, the Company formed EQT GP Holdings, LP (EQGP) (NYSE: EQGP), a Delaware limited partnership, to own the Company's partnership interests in EQM. As of December 31, 2017, the Company owned the entire non-economic general partner interest and a 90.1% limited partner interest, in EQGP. As of December 31, 2017, EQGP's only cash-generating assets were the following EQM partnership interests: a 26.6% limited partner interest in EQM; a 1.8% general partner interest in EQM; and all of EQM's IDRs. The Company is the ultimate parent company of EQGP, EQM and RMP. 
Due to the Company's ownership and control of EQGP, EQM and RMP, the results of EQGP, EQM and RMP are consolidated in the Company’s financial statements.  The Company records the noncontrolling interests of the public limited partners of EQGP, EQM and RMP in its financial statements.

• | On October 4, 2017, the Company completed the public offering of $3.0 billion principal amount of notes. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the Rice Merger, to pay expenses related to the Rice Merger and related transactions, to redeem $700 million aggregate principal amount of Company indebtedness due in 2018 and for other general corporate purposes.


• | On October 13, 2017, the FERC issued the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (MVP Joint Venture).

Business Segments
Prior to the Rice Merger, the Company reported its results of operations through three business segments: EQT Production, EQT Gathering and EQT Transmission. These reporting segments reflected the Company's lines of business and were reported in the same manner in which the Company evaluated its operating performance through September 30, 2017. Following the Rice Merger, the Company adjusted its internal reporting structure to incorporate the newly acquired assets. The Company now conducts its business through five business segments: EQT Production, EQM Gathering (formerly known as EQT Gathering), EQM Transmission (formerly known as EQT Transmission), RMP Gathering and RMP Water. The EQT Production segment incorporates the Company’s production activities, including those acquired in the Rice Merger, the Company's marketing operations, and certain gathering operations primarily supporting the Company's production activities, including the Rice retained gathering assets. The EQM Gathering segment and the EQM Transmission segment include all of the Company's assets and operations that are owned by EQM; therefore, the financial and operational disclosures related to EQM Gathering and EQM Transmission in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the same as EQM’s disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. The RMP Gathering segment contains the Company's gathering assets that are owned by RMP. The RMP Water segment contains the Company's water pipelines, impoundment facilities, pumping stations, take point facilities and measurement facilities owned by RMP. Following the Rice Merger, the financial and operational disclosures related to RMP Gathering and RMP Water will be the same as RMP’s successor disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

EQT Production Business Segment

EQT Production holds 21.4 Tcfe of proved natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves across approximately 4.0 million gross acres, including approximately 1.1 million gross acres in the Marcellus play, many of which also include associated deep Utica or Upper Devonian drilling rights, and approximately 0.1 million gross acres in the Ohio Utica, as of December 31, 2017. EQT believes that it is a technology leader in horizontal drilling and completions in the Appalachian Basin and continues to improve its operations through the use of new technology.  EQT Production’s strategy is to maximize shareholder value by maintaining an industry leading cost structure to profitably develop its reserves.  EQT’s proved reserves increased 59% in 2017, primarily as a result of acquisitions. The Company’s Marcellus assets constituted approximately 16.9 Tcfe of the Company's total proved reserves as of December 31, 2017.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s proved reserves were as follows:

(Bcfe) | Marcellus | UpperDevonian | | Ohio Utica | Other | Total
Proved Developed | 8,092 | | 683 | | 757 | | 1,767 | 11,299
Proved Undeveloped | 8,805 | | 293 | | 1,049 | | — | 10,147
Total Proved Reserves | 16,897 | | 976 | | 1,806 | | 1,767 | 21,446


The Company’s natural gas wells are generally low-risk, having a long reserve life with relatively low development and production costs on a per unit basis.  Assuming that future annual production from these reserves is consistent with 2018 production guidance, the remaining reserve life of the Company’s total proved reserves, as calculated by dividing total proved reserves by 2018 produced volumes guidance, is 14 years.
The Company invested approximately $1,385 million on well development during 2017, with total production sales volumes of 887.5 Bcfe, an increase of 17% over the previous year.  EQT Production expects to spend approximately $2.2 billion for well development (primarily drilling and completion) in 2018, which is expected to support the drilling of approximately 195 gross wells, including 134 Marcellus wells, 16 Upper Devonian wells and 45 Ohio Utica wells. The Company also intends to spend approximately $0.2 billion for acreage fill-ins, bolt-on leasing, and other items. During the past three years, the Company’s number of wells drilled (spud) and related capital expenditures for well development were:

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Gross wells spud: | | | | | 
Horizontal Marcellus* | 193 | | | 130 | | | 157
Ohio Utica | 7 | | | — | | | — 
Other | 1 | | | 5 | | | 4 
Total | 201 | | | 135 | | | 161
Capital expenditures for well development (in millions):
Horizontal Marcellus* | $ | 1,295 | | | $ | 686 | | $ | 1,527
Ohio Utica | 31 | | | — | | | — 
Other | 59 | | | 97 | | | 143
Total | $ | 1,385 | | | $ | 783 | | $ | 1,670

* Includes Upper Devonian formations.
The EQT Production segment also includes the following gathering assets which are not owned by EQM or RMP:

• | approximately 152 miles of high pressure gathering lines and 4 compressor stations in Belmont and Monroe County, Ohio as of December 31, 2017;


• | Strike Force Midstream Holdings LLC's (Strike Force Holdings) 75% membership interest in Strike Force Midstream LLC (Strike Force Midstream), which owns approximately 67 miles of high pressure gathering lines and 2 compressor stations in Belmont and Monroe County, Ohio, as of December 31, 2017; and

10


• | approximately 6,600 miles of gathering lines that primarily support the Company's and third party production operations in non-core areas of declining production.

Third party revenues for these gathering services are included in pipeline and net marketing services revenues for the EQT Production segment and were approximately $30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, inclusive of third party revenues during the period of November 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017 for EQT Production including the Rice retained gathering assets.    
The Company optimizes its transportation and processing assets to sell natural gas and NGLs to marketers, utilities and industrial customers within its operational footprint and in markets available through the Company's current transportation portfolio. The Company provides marketing services for the benefit of EQT Production and third parties and manages approximately 2.4 Bcf per day of firm third party contractual pipeline takeaway capacity and 685 MMcf per day of firm third party processing capacity. The Company has also committed to 1.29 Bcf per day of firm capacity on the MVP (defined under EQM Transmission) and approximately 0.3 Bcf per day of additional third party contractual takeaway capacity expected to come online in future periods.
EQM Gathering Business Segment
As of December 31, 2017, EQM Gathering included approximately 300 miles of high pressure gathering lines with approximately 2.3 Bcf per day of total firm contracted gathering capacity, compression of approximately 189,000 horsepower and multiple interconnect points with EQM Transmission's transmission and storage system. EQM Gathering's system also included approximately 1,500 miles of FERC-regulated low pressure gathering lines. 
In the ordinary course of its business, EQM Gathering pursues gathering expansion projects for affiliates and third party producers. EQM Gathering invested approximately $197 million on gathering projects in 2017 that added 475 MMcf per day of firm gathering capacity in southwestern Pennsylvania. This included the final phase of the header pipeline for Range Resources Corporation (Range Resources), which was placed in-service during the second quarter of 2017. The system now provides total firm gathering capacity of 600 MMcf per day at a total project cost of approximately $240 million. This and other expansion projects, primarily for affiliates, supported increased gathered volumes of 11% and gathering revenues of 14% in 2017. In 2018, EQM Gathering estimates capital expenditures of approximately $300 million on gathering expansion projects, primarily driven by affiliate wellhead and header projects in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, including the Hammerhead project, a 1.2 Bcf per day gathering header connecting Pennsylvania and West Virginia production to the MVP.
EQM Transmission Business Segment
As of December 31, 2017, EQM Transmission's transmission and storage system included an approximately 950-mile FERC-regulated interstate pipeline that connects to seven interstate pipelines and local distribution companies. The transmission system is supported by 18 associated natural gas storage reservoirs with approximately 645 MMcf per day of peak withdrawal capacity, 43 Bcf of working gas capacity and 41 compressor units, with total throughput capacity of approximately 4.4 Bcf per day and compression of approximately 120,000 horsepower as of December 31, 2017. 

In the ordinary course of its business, EQM Transmission pursues transmission projects aimed at profitably increasing system capacity. EQM Transmission invested approximately $111 million on transmission and storage system infrastructure in 2017. Revenues in 2017 increased by approximately $41 million or 12% compared to 2016. In 2018, EQM Transmission will focus on the following transmission projects:

• | Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP). The MVP Joint Venture is a joint venture with affiliates of each of NextEra Energy, Inc., Consolidated Edison, Inc., WGL Holdings, Inc. and RGC Resources, Inc. EQM is the operator of the MVP and owned a 45.5% interest in the MVP Joint Venture as of December 31, 2017. The 42 inch diameter MVP has a targeted capacity of 2.0 Bcf per day and is estimated to span 300 miles extending from EQM Transmission's existing transmission and storage system in Wetzel County, West Virginia to Pittsylvania County, Virginia providing access to the growing Southeast demand markets. As currently designed, the MVP is estimated to cost a total of approximately $3.5 billion, excluding AFUDC, with EQM funding its proportionate share through capital contributions made to the joint venture. In 2018, EQM expects to provide capital contributions of $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion to the MVP Joint Venture. The MVP Joint Venture has secured a total of 2.0 Bcf per day of firm capacity commitments at 20-year terms, including a 1.29 Bcf per day firm capacity commitment by EQT, and is currently in negotiation with additional shippers who have expressed interest in the MVP project. On October 13, 2017, the FERC issued the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the project. In January 2018, the MVP Joint Venture received multiple limited notices to proceed from the FERC to begin construction 

11

activities on certain facilities. The MVP Joint Venture plans to commence construction in the first quarter of 2018. The pipeline is targeted to be placed in-service during the fourth quarter of 2018.

• | Transmission Expansion. In 2018, EQM Transmission estimates capital expenditures of approximately $100 million for other transmission expansion projects, primarily attributable to the Equitrans Expansion project. The Equitrans Expansion project is designed to provide north-to-south capacity on the mainline Equitrans system for deliveries to the MVP.

RMP Gathering Business Segment
As of December 31, 2017, RMP Gathering included an approximately 178 mile high pressure dry gas gathering system with approximately 5.1 TBtu per day of gathering capacity and compression capacity of approximately 85,000 horsepower that services the Company and third parties in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, with connections to five interstate pipelines.
RMP Water Business Segment
RMP Water's assets include water pipelines, impoundment facilities, pumping stations, take point facilities and measurement facilities used to support well completion activities and to collect and recycle or dispose of flowback and produced water for the Company and third parties in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, and Belmont County, Ohio. As of December 31, 2017, RMP Water's Pennsylvania assets provided access to 29.4 MMgal per day of fresh water from the Monongahela River and several other regional water sources, and RMP Water's Ohio assets provided access to 14.0 MMgal per day of fresh water from the Ohio River and several other regional water sources. 
Strategy

EQT’s strategy is to maximize shareholder value by profitably and safely developing its undeveloped reserves while maintaining an industry leading cost structure and effectively and efficiently utilizing EQM's and RMP's extensive midstream assets that are uniquely positioned across the Marcellus, Upper Devonian and Utica Shales.
Following the Rice Merger, the Company has significant acreage scale in the core of the Marcellus which will allow EQT to drill considerably longer laterals, realize operational efficiencies and improve overall returns. EQT believes that it is a technology leader in horizontal drilling and completion in the Appalachian Basin and continues to improve its operations through the use of new technology.  Development of multi-well pads in conjunction with longer laterals, well spacing, and completion techniques allows EQT to maximize recoveries per acre while reducing the overall environmental surface footprint of the Company’s drilling operations.

The Company's midstream assets span a wide area of the Marcellus, Upper Devonian and Utica Shales in southwestern Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia and southeastern Ohio. This footprint provides a competitive advantage that uniquely positions the Company for continued growth. EQM and RMP intend to capitalize on the growing need for gathering, transmission and water infrastructure in this region, including the need for midstream header connectivity to interstate pipelines in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. 
The Company’s board of directors has formed a committee to evaluate options for addressing the Company’s sum-of-the-parts discount. The board will announce a decision by the end of March, 2018, after considering the committee’s recommendation.
See “Capital Resources and Liquidity” in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details regarding the Company’s capital expenditures.

Markets and Customers
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of EQT's total operating revenues for 2017 and 2016. One customer within the EQT Production segment accounted for approximately 10% of EQT's total operating revenues in 2015. The Company believes that the loss of this customer would not have a material adverse effect on its business because alternative customers for the Company's natural gas are available.

Natural Gas Sales:  The Company’s produced natural gas is sold to marketers, utilities and industrial customers located in the Appalachian Basin and in the markets available through the Company's current transportation portfolio, which includes markets in the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Northeast United States. Natural gas is a commodity and therefore the Company typically receives market-based pricing. The market price for natural gas in the Appalachian Basin is lower relative to the price at Henry Hub, 
12

Louisiana (the location for pricing NYMEX natural gas futures) as a result of the increased supply of natural gas in the Appalachian Basin. In order to protect cash flow from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices, the Company hedges a portion of its forecasted natural gas production, most of which is hedged at NYMEX natural gas prices. The Company’s hedging strategy and information regarding its derivative instruments is set forth under the heading “Commodity Risk Management” in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” and in Notes 1 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
NGLs Sales:  The Company sells NGLs from its own gas production and from gas marketed for third parties.  In its Appalachian operations, the Company primarily contracts with MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P. (MarkWest) to process natural gas in order to extract the heavier hydrocarbon stream (consisting predominately of ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane and natural gasoline) primarily from EQT Production’s produced gas. The Company also contracts with MarkWest to market a portion of the Company's NGLs. The Company also has contractual processing arrangements with Williams Ohio Valley Midstream LLC to market NGLs on behalf of the Company in its Appalachian operations. In its Permian Basin operations, the Company sells gas to third party processors at a weighted average liquids component price. 
The following table presents the average sales price on a per Mcfe basis to EQT Corporation for sales of produced natural gas, NGLs and oil, with and without cash settled derivatives, for the years ended December 31:

 | 2017 | | 2016 | 2015
Average sales price per Mcfe sold (excluding cash settled derivatives) | $ | 2.98 | | $ | 1.99 | $ | 2.38
Average sales price per Mcfe sold (including cash settled derivatives) | $ | 3.04 | | $ | 2.47 | $ | 3.09


In addition, price information for all products is included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” under the caption “Consolidated Operational Data,” and incorporated herein by reference.

EQM Gathering: EQT Production accounted for approximately 89% and 84% of EQM Gathering's gathering revenues and volumes, respectively, for 2017.
EQM provides gathering services in two manners: firm service and interruptible service. The fixed monthly fee under a firm contract is referred to as a firm reservation fee, which is recognized ratably over the contract period based on the contracted volume regardless of the amount of natural gas that is gathered. If there is available system capacity, customers can flow gas above the firm commitment volumes for a usage charge per unit at a rate that is generally the same or lower than the firm capacity charge per unit. EQM has firm gas gathering agreements in high pressure development areas with approximately 2.3 Bcf per day of total firm contracted gathering capacity as of December 31, 2017. Including expected future capacity from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed but for which EQM had entered into firm gathering agreements, approximately 2.4 Bcf per day of firm gathering capacity was subscribed under firm gathering contracts as of December 31, 2017. On EQM's low pressure regulated gathering system, the typical gathering agreement is interruptible and has a one year term with month-to-month roll over provisions terminable upon at least 30 days notice. The rates for gathering service on the regulated system are based on the maximum posted tariff rate and assessed on actual receipts into the gathering system. EQM generally does not take title to the natural gas gathered for its customers but retains a percentage of wellhead natural gas receipts to recover natural gas used to run its compressor stations and other requirements on all of its gathering systems.

EQM Transmission: In 2017, EQT Production accounted for approximately 64% of transmission volumes and 53% of transmission revenues for EQM Transmission. Other customers include local distribution companies, marketers, other independent producers and commercial and industrial users. EQM's transmission system provides these customers with access to adjacent markets in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio and also provides access to the Mid-Atlantic, Northeastern, Midwestern and Gulf Coast markets in the United States through interconnect capacity with major interstate pipelines.
EQM Transmission generally does not take title to the natural gas transported or stored for its customers. EQM Transmission provides services in two manners: firm service and interruptible service. The fixed monthly fee under a firm contract is referred to as a capacity reservation fee, which is recognized ratably over the contract period based on the contracted volume regardless of the amount of natural gas that is transported or stored. In addition to capacity reservation fees, EQM Transmission may also collect usage fees when a firm transmission customer uses the capacity it has reserved under these firm transmission contracts. Where applicable, the usage fees are assessed on the actual volume of natural gas transported on the system. A firm customer is billed an additional usage fee on volumes in excess of firm capacity when the level of natural gas received for delivery from the customer exceeds its reserved capacity. Customers are not assured capacity or service for volumes in excess of firm capacity on the applicable pipeline as these volumes have the same priority as interruptible service.
13

Under interruptible service contracts, customers pay usage fees based on their actual utilization of assets. Customers that have executed interruptible contracts are not assured capacity or service on the applicable systems. To the extent that physical capacity that is contracted for firm service is not fully utilized or excess capacity that has not been contracted for service exists, the system can allocate such capacity to interruptible services.
Including expected future capacity from expansion projects that are not yet fully constructed but for which EQM has entered into firm contracts, approximately 5.1 Bcf per day of transmission capacity and 31.3 Bcf of storage capacity, respectively, were subscribed under firm transmission and storage contracts as of December 31, 2017. EQM Transmission's firm transmission and storage contracts had a weighted average remaining term of approximately 15 years as of December 31, 2017 based on total projected contracted revenues.
As of December 31, 2017, approximately 89% of EQM Transmission's contracted transmission firm capacity was subscribed by customers under negotiated rate agreements under its tariff. Approximately 9% of EQM Transmission’s contracted transmission firm capacity was subscribed at the recourse rates under its tariff, which are the maximum rates an interstate pipeline may charge for its services under its tariff. The remaining 2% of EQM Transmission’s contracted transmission firm capacity was subscribed at discounted rates, which are less than the maximum rates an interstate pipeline may charge for its services under its tariff.
EQM Transmission has an acreage dedication from EQT pursuant to which EQM Transmission has the right to elect to transport on its transmission and storage system all natural gas produced from wells drilled by EQT under an area covering approximately 60,000 acres in Allegheny, Washington and Greene Counties in Pennsylvania and Wetzel, Marion, Taylor, Tyler, Doddridge, Harrison and Lewis Counties in West Virginia. EQT has a significant natural gas drilling program in these areas.

Natural Gas Marketing: EQT Energy, LLC (EQT Energy) and Rice Energy Marketing LLC, EQT's indirect wholly owned marketing subsidiaries, provide marketing services and contractual pipeline capacity management for the benefit of EQT Production and third parties. The marketing subsidiaries also engage in risk management and hedging activities on behalf of EQT Production, the objective of which is to limit the Company’s exposure to shifts in market prices. 
RMP Gathering: During the year ended December 31, 2017, EQT and Rice, prior to the Rice Merger, represented substantially all of RMP Gathering’s gathering and compression revenues. 
RMP Gathering has secured dedications from certain EQT affiliates under various fixed price per unit gathering and compression agreements covering (i) approximately 246,000 gross acres of EQT's acreage position in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, and (ii) subject to certain exceptions and limitations pursuant to the gas gathering and compression agreements, any future acreage certain affiliates of EQT acquire within these counties.
RMP Water Services:  During the year ended December 31, 2017, EQT and Rice, prior to the Rice Merger, represented approximately 96% of RMP Water's water service revenues. 
RMP Water has the exclusive right to provide certain fluid handling services to EQT Production until December 22, 2029, and from month to month thereafter. The fluid handling services include the exclusive right to provide fresh water for well completions operations and to collect and recycle or dispose of flowback and produced water within areas of dedication in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania and Belmont County, Ohio. RMP Water also provides water services to third parties under fee-based contracts to support well completion activities.
Competition

Natural gas producers compete in the acquisition of properties, the search for and development of reserves, the production, transportation and sale of natural gas and NGLs and the securing of services, labor and equipment required to conduct operations. Competitors include independent oil and gas companies, major oil and gas companies and individual producers and operators within and outside of the Appalachian Basin. 
Competition for natural gas gathering, transmission and storage volumes is primarily based on rates, customer commitment levels, timing, performance, commercial terms, reliability, service levels, location, reputation and fuel efficiencies.  Key competitors in the natural gas transmission and storage market include companies that own major natural gas pipelines. Key competitors for gathering systems include companies that own major natural gas pipelines, independent gas gatherers and integrated energy companies. EQT competes with numerous companies when marketing natural gas and NGLs. Some of these competitors are affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to end-users.
14

Key competitors for water services include natural gas producers that develop their own water distribution systems in lieu of employing the Company's assets and other natural gas midstream companies. Our ability to attract volumes to the water services business depends on the Company's ability to evaluate and select suitable projects and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.
Regulation

Regulation of the Company’s Operations

EQT Production’s exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal, state and local laws and regulations, including regulations related to the location of wells; the method of drilling, well construction, well stimulation, hydraulic fracturing and casing design; water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes; well production; spill prevention plans; the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials incidental to oil and gas operations; surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located; the plugging and abandoning of wells; the calculation, reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes; and the gathering of production in certain circumstances.  These regulations and any delays in obtaining related authorizations may affect the costs and timing of developing EQT Production’s natural gas resources.

EQT Production’s operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations, including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units; setbacks; the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells; drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures; and the unitization or pooling of natural gas properties. Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia and, for Utica or other deep wells, West Virginia allow the statutory pooling or unitization of tracts to facilitate development and exploration. In West Virginia, the Company must rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases for Marcellus and Upper Devonian acreage. In 2013, the Pennsylvania legislature enacted lease integration legislation, which authorizes joint development of existing contiguous leases, and Texas permits similar joint development. In addition, state conservation and oil and gas laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and Texas sets allowables on the amount of production permitted from a well.

The Company's gathering and transmission operations are subject to various types of federal and state environmental laws and local zoning ordinances, including air permitting requirements for compressor station and dehydration units and other permitting requirements; erosion and sediment control requirements for compressor station and pipeline construction projects; waste management requirements and spill prevention plans for compressor stations; various recordkeeping and reporting requirements for air permits and waste management practices; compliance with safety regulations; and siting and noise regulations for compressor stations and transmission facilities. These regulations may increase the costs of operating existing pipelines and compressor stations and increase the costs of, and the time to develop, new or expanded pipelines and compressor stations.

The Company's interstate natural gas transmission and storage operations are regulated by the FERC, and certain gathering lines are also subject to rate regulation by the FERC. The FERC approves tariffs that establish EQM’s rates, cost recovery mechanisms and other terms and conditions of service applicable to its FERC-regulated assets. The fees or rates established under EQM’s tariffs are a function of its costs of providing services to customers, including a reasonable return on invested capital. The FERC’s authority over transmission operations also extends to: storage and related services; certification and construction of new interstate transmission and storage facilities; extension or abandonment of interstate transmission and storage services and facilities; maintenance of accounts and records; relationships between pipelines and certain affiliates; terms and conditions of service; depreciation and amortization policies; acquisition and disposition of facilities; the safety of pipelines; and initiation and discontinuation of services.
In 2010, the U.S. Congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivative market and entities, such as the Company, that participate in that market. The legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), required the CFTC, the SEC and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing this legislation. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the CFTC had adopted and implemented many final rules that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants, including the Company, such as recordkeeping and certain reporting obligations.  Other CFTC rules that may be relevant to the Company have yet to be finalized.  Because significant CFTC rules relevant to natural gas hedging activities have not been adopted or implemented, it is not possible at this time to predict the extent of the impact of the regulations on the Company’s hedging program or regulatory compliance obligations.  The Company has experienced increased, and anticipates additional, compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing regulatory environment.

Regulators periodically review or audit the Company’s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.  The Company anticipates that compliance with existing laws and regulations governing current operations will not have a material adverse effect upon its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.  Additional proposals that affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by the U.S. Congress, the states, regulatory agencies and the courts. The Company cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or the effect that such proposals may have on the Company.
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation

The business operations of the Company are also subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to, among other things, the release, emission or discharge of materials into the environment; the generation, storage, transportation, handling and disposal of materials (including solid and hazardous wastes); the safety of employees and the general public; pollution; site remediation; and preservation or protection of human health and safety, natural resources, wildlife and the environment. The Company must take into account environmental, health and safety regulations in, among other things, planning, designing, constructing, operating and abandoning wells, pipelines and related facilities. The Company has established procedures for ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures.  

Vast quantities of natural gas deposits exist in shale and other formations. It is customary in the Company’s industry to recover natural gas from these shale formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling. Hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks, or fractures, in formations underground where water, sand and other additives are pumped under high pressure into a shale gas formation. These deeper formations are geologically separated and isolated from fresh ground water supplies by overlying rock layers. The Company’s well construction practices include installation of multiple layers of protective steel casing surrounded by cement that are specifically designed and installed to protect freshwater aquifers.  To assess water sources near our drilling locations, the Company conducts baseline and, as appropriate, post-drilling water testing at all water wells within at least 2,500 feet of the Company's drilling pads.  Legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have sought to render more stringent permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing. If passed into law, the additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing may increase the cost to or limit the Company’s ability to obtain permits to construct wells.
See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of expenditures related to environmental matters. 

Climate Change

Legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation. The EPA and various states have issued a number of proposed and final laws and regulations that limit greenhouse gas emissions. Legislation or regulation that restricts carbon emissions could increase the Company’s cost of environmental compliance by requiring the Company to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities and/or purchase emission allowances. Climate change and greenhouse gas legislation or regulation could also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard to existing and new facilities, or impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements. Conversely, legislation or regulation that sets a price on or otherwise restricts carbon emissions could also benefit the Company by increasing demand for natural gas, because the combustion of natural gas results in substantially fewer carbon emissions per Btu of heat generated than other fossil fuels, such as coal. The effect on the Company of any new legislative or regulatory measures will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted.
Employees

The Company and its subsidiaries had 2,067 employees at the end of 2017; none are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
