Core Technologies
 
The Company’s core technologies can be referred to as “transaction-enabling” and “business process work flow” technologies. These technologies include various forms of electronic signature methods, such as handwritten, biometric, click-to-sign and others, as well as technologies related to signature verification, authentication, cryptography and the logging of audit trails to prove signers’ intent. These technologies enable the appending of secure, legal and regulatory compliant electronic signatures coupled with an enhanced user experience, all at a fraction of the time and cost required by traditional, paper-based processes for signature capture.
Products
 
The Company’s enterprise-class SignatureOne® and iSign® suite of electronic signature solutions enable businesses to implement truly paperless, electronic signature-driven business processes. The aggregate of the software functionality enabling the digitization of end-to-end work flow processes is sometimes referred to as “digital transaction management” (DTM). Many applications provide electronic forms and allow users to fill-in information, but most of these applications still require users to print out a paper copy for a handwritten, ink signature. Solutions powered by iSign products allow legally binding electronic signatures to be added to digital documents, eliminating the need for paper to memorialize the completion, approval or authentication of the transaction. This allows users to reduce transaction times and processing costs.
