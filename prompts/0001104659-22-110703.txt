Introduction
 
We are a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more operating businesses. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
 
Our founder, Michael Klein, is also the founder and managing partner of M. Klein and Company, which he founded in 2012. M. Klein and Company is a global strategic advisory firm that provides its clients a variety of advice tailored to their objectives. M. Klein and Company has established an entity within the firm, Archimedes Advisors, which will invest in our sponsor and which consists of operating partners (“operating partners”) who will assist Mr. Klein in sourcing potential acquisition targets, and creating long-term value in the business combination for us. M. Klein and Company’s operating partners are comprised of former senior operating executives of leading S&P 500 companies across multiple sectors and industries, including consumer, industrial, materials, energy, mining, chemicals, finance, data, software, enterprise technology, and media.
 
Our executive offices are located at 640 Fifth Avenue, 12th Floor, New York, NY 10019 and our telephone number is (212) 380-7500. Our corporate website address is www.churchillcapitalcorp.com.

Company History
 
In May 2019, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 8,625,000 shares of Class B common stock (our “founder shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. Our Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock, on a one-for-one basis, upon the completion of a business combination. On June 7, 2019, we effected a stock dividend at one-third of one share of Class B common stock for each outstanding share of Class B common stock, resulting in an aggregate of 11,500,000 founder shares outstanding. On June 26, 2019, we effected a further stock dividend of one-half of a share of Class B common stock for each outstanding share of Class B common stock, resulting in our sponsor holding an aggregate of 17,250,000 founder Shares. The number of founder shares issued was based on the expectation that the founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (collectively, our “common stock’) upon completion of the initial public offering (the “IPO”).
 
On July 1, 2019, we completed our IPO of 69,000,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit (the “units”), generating gross proceeds of $690,000,000. Each unit consists of one of the Company’s shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-third of one warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
 
Concurrently with the completion of the IPO, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 15,800,000 warrants (the “private placement warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per warrant, or $15,800,000 in the aggregate. An aggregate of $690,000,000 from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement warrants was placed in a trust account (the “trust account”) such that the trust account held $690,000,000 at the time of closing of the IPO. Each whole private placement warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
 
On July 23, 2019, we announced that, commencing July 26, 2019, holders of the 69,000,000 units sold in the IPO may elect to separately trade the shares of Class A common stock and the warrants included in the units. Those units not separated continued to trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “CCX.U” and the shares of Class A common stock and warrants that were separated trade under the symbols “CCX” and “CCX WS,” respectively.

Recent Developments
 
Skillsoft Merger Agreement
 
On October 12, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Skillsoft Merger Agreement”) with Software Luxembourg Holding S.A., a public limited liability company (société anonyme) incorporated and organized under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (“Skillsoft”).
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Skillsoft Merger Agreement, a business combination between Churchill and Skillsoft will be effected through the merger of Skillsoft with and into Churchill, with Churchill surviving as the surviving company (the “Skillsoft Merger”). At the effective time of the Skillsoft Merger (the “Effective Time”), (a) each Class A share of Skillsoft, with nominal value of $0.01 per share (“Skillsoft Class A Shares”), outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be automatically canceled and Churchill will issue as consideration therefor (i) such number of shares of Churchill’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Churchill Class A Common Stock”) equal to the Class A First Lien Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Skillsoft Merger Agreement), and (ii) Churchill’s Class C common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Churchill Class C Common Stock”), equal to the Class C Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Skillsoft Merger Agreement), and (b) each Class B share of Skillsoft, with nominal value of $0.01 per share (“Skillsoft Class B Shares”), will be automatically canceled and Churchill will issue as consideration therefor such number of shares of Churchill Class A common stock equal to the Per Class B Share Merger Consideration (as defined in the Skillsoft Merger Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Skillsoft Merger Agreement, Churchill is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Churchill Class A Common Stock to be issued in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Skillsoft Merger Agreement (the “Skillsoft Transactions”) to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) prior to the closing of the Skillsoft Merger (the “Skillsoft Closing”). Immediately following the Effective Time, Churchill will redeem all of the shares of Class C Common Stock issued to the holders of Skillsoft Class A Shares for an aggregate redemption price of (i) $505,000,000 in cash and (ii) indebtedness under the Existing Second Out Credit Agreement (as defined in the Skillsoft Merger Agreement), as amended by the Existing Second Out Credit Agreement Amendment (as defined in the Skillsoft Merger Agreement), in the aggregate principal amount equal to the sum of $20,000,000 to be issued by the Surviving Corporation (as defined in the Skillsoft Merger Agreement) or one of its subsidiaries, in each case, pro rata among the holders of Churchill Class C Common Stock issued in connection with the Skillsoft Merger.
 
The consummation of the proposed Skillsoft Transactions is subject to the receipt of the requisite approval of (i) the stockholders of Churchill (the “Churchill Stockholder Approval”) and (ii) the shareholders of Skillsoft (the “Skillsoft Shareholder Approval”) and the fulfillment of certain other conditions.
 
Global Knowledge Merger Agreement
 
Concurrently with its entry into the Skillsoft Merger Agreement, Churchill also entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Global Knowledge Merger Agreement”) by and among Churchill, Magnet Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Churchill (“Merger Sub”), and Albert DE Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation owned by investment funds affiliated with Rhône Capital L.L.C.

Pursuant to the Global Knowledge Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Global Knowledge, with Global Knowledge surviving the transaction as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Churchill (the “Global Knowledge Merger”). At the effective time (the “Global Knowledge Effective Time”) of the Global Knowledge Merger, as consideration for the Global Knowledge Merger, 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Global Knowledge will be converted, in the aggregate, into the right to receive warrants, each of which shall entitle the holders thereof to purchase one share of Class A Churchill Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The aggregate number of warrants to be received by the equity holders of Global Knowledge as consideration in the Global Knowledge Merger will be 5,000,000. The warrants to be issued to the equity holders of Global Knowledge will be non-redeemable and otherwise substantially similar to the private placement warrants issued to the Churchill Sponsor in connection with Churchill’s initial public offering.
 
The consummation of the proposed Global Knowledge Merger (the “Global Knowledge Closing”) is subject to the consummation of the Skillsoft Merger, among other conditions contained in the Global Knowledge Merger Agreement.
 
Restructuring Support Agreement
 
On October 12, 2020, Global Knowledge entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the “Global Knowledge RSA”) with (i) 100% of its lenders under that certain Amended and Restated First Lien Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of January 30, 2015, as amended from time to time, by and among, inter alios, GK Holdings, as borrower, the guarantors from time to time party thereto, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Credit Suisse, acting in its capacity as administrative agent and collateral agent (the “First Lien Credit Agreement,” and the lenders thereto, the “First Lien Lenders”); and (ii) 100% of its lenders under that certain Amended and Restated Second Lien Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of January 30, 2015, as amended from time to time, by and among, inter alios, GK Holdings, as borrower, the guarantors from time to time party thereto, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Wilmington Trust, acting in its capacity as administrative agent and collateral agent (the “Second Lien Credit Agreement,” and there lenders thereto, the “Second Lien Lenders,” together with the First Lien Lenders, the “Secured Lenders”). The Global Knowledge RSA contemplates an out-of-court restructuring (the “Restructuring”) that provides meaningful recoveries, funded by Churchill, to all Secured Lenders. Churchill is a third-party beneficiary of the Global Knowledge RSA with respect to enforcement of certain specific provisions and its explicit rights under the Global Knowledge RSA and not a direct party.

On the Out-of-Court Transaction Effective Date, which shall occur concurrently with the Global Knowledge Closing (and only upon such closing), each holder of a claim arising under that certain Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of November 26, 2019, by and among, inter alios, Global Knowledge Holdings B.V. and Global Knowledge Network (Canada), Inc., as borrowers, the guarantors from time to time party thereto, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Blue Torch Finance LLC, in its capacity as administrative agent, will be paid in cash, in full (including all accrued and unpaid interest through the date of repayment), as set forth in the Restructuring Term Sheet.

Subscription Agreements
 
Prosus Agreements
 
On October 12, 2020, in connection with the execution of the Skillsoft Merger Agreement, MIH Ventures B.V. (“Prosus”) entered into a subscription agreement (the “Prosus Agreement”) with Churchill and the Sponsor, pursuant to which Prosus subscribed for 10,000,000 newly-issued shares of Churchill Class A common stock, at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, to be issued at the closing (the “First Step Prosus Investment”), and Churchill granted Prosus a 30-day option (the “Option”) to subscribe for up to the lesser of (i) an additional 40,000,000 newly-issued shares of Churchill Class A common stock, at a purchase price of $10.00 per share or (ii) such additional number of shares that would result in Prosus beneficially owning shares of Class A common stock representing 35% of the issued and outstanding shares of Churchill Class A common stock on a fully-diluted and as-converted basis (excluding any warrants issued to Prosus pursuant to the Prosus Agreement) immediately following the consummation of the Skillsoft Merger (the “Prosus Maximum Ownership Amount”) (the “Second Step Prosus Investment” and together with the First Step Prosus Investment, the “Prosus PIPE Investment”). On November 10, 2020, Prosus exercised the Option to subscribe for an additional 40,000,000 shares of Churchill Class A common stock in the Second Step Prosus Investment (or such number of shares as may be reduced pursuant to the Prosus Agreement). Churchill and Prosus also agreed that following the consummation of the Skillsoft Merger, to the extent that following the Prosus Second Step Investment, Prosus beneficially owns less than the Prosus Maximum Ownership Amount, Prosus will have the concurrent right to purchase a number of additional shares of Churchill Class A common stock, at $10.00 per share, that would result in Prosus maintaining beneficial ownership of at least, but no more than, the Prosus Maximum Ownership Amount (the “Prosus Top-Up Right”).
 
As part of the Prosus Agreement, Prosus and the Company agreed to a strategic support agreement, pursuant to which Prosus will provide certain business development and investor relations support services in the event it exercises the Option and beneficially owns at least 20% of the outstanding Churchill Class A common stock following closing of the Prosus PIPE Investment on a fully-diluted and as-converted basis. If Prosus exercises the Option and consummates the Prosus PIPE Investment, it will also nominate an individual to serve as the chairman of Churchill’s Board. Pursuant to the Prosus Agreement, in connection with Prosus’s exercise of the Option and following the consummation of the Second Step Prosus Investment, Churchill will issue to Prosus warrants to purchase a number of shares of Churchill Class A common stock equal to one-third of the number of shares of Churchill Class A common stock purchased in the Prosus PIPE Investment (the “Prosus Warrants”). The Prosus Warrants will have terms substantively identical to those included in the units offered in Churchill’s IPO.
 
The issuance of the shares of Churchill Class A common stock pursuant to the Prosus Agreement are subject to approval by Churchill’s stockholders. The obligations to consummate the Prosus PIPE Investment are conditioned upon, among other things, customary closing conditions, expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, satisfaction of the closing conditions under the Skillsoft Merger Agreement, the consummation of the Skillsoft Merger and, with respect to the Second Step Prosus Investment, (i) a written notification issued by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) that it has determined that the Prosus PIPE Investment is not a “covered transaction” and not subject to review by CFIUS under applicable law, (ii) a written notification issued by CFIUS that it has concluded all action under Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (codified at 50 U.S.C. § 4565) and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including those codified at 31 C.F.R. Parts 800 and 801 (the “DPA”) and determined that there are no unresolved national security concerns with respect to the Prosus PIPE Investment or (iii) if CFIUS has sent a report to the President of the United States (the “President”) requesting the President’s decision and either (a) the President shall have notified the parties hereto of his determination not to use his powers pursuant to the DPA to suspend or prohibit the consummation of the Subscription or (B) the fifteen (15) days allotted for presidential action under the DPA shall have passed without any determination by the President. Prosus received notice of early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act in respect of the Prosus PIPE Investment on December 15, 2020. Due to the CFIUS condition, among other closing conditions, there can be no assurance that the Second Step Prosus Investment will be consummated at the closing of the Merger or thereafter. The consummation of the Prosus PIPE Investment is not a condition to the closing of the Merger.
 
SuRo Subscription Agreement
 
On October 14, 2020, in connection with the execution of the Skillsoft Merger Agreement, Churchill entered into a subscription agreement with SuRo Capital Corp. (“SuRo”) pursuant to which SuRo subscribed for 1,000,000 newly-issued shares of Churchill Class A common stock, at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, to be issued at the closing of the Merger (the “SuRo Subscription Agreement”). The obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the SuRo Subscription Agreement are conditioned upon, among other things, customary closing conditions and the consummation of the Skillsoft Merger. The agreement is based on a stated purchase price for a fixed number of shares, therefore the agreement is equity classified.
Lodbrok Subscription Agreement
 
On October 13, 2020, in connection with the execution of the Global Knowledge Merger Agreement, Churchill entered into a subscription agreement with Lodbrok Capital LLP (“Lodbrok”) pursuant to which Lodbrok subscribed for 2,000,000 newly-issued shares of Churchill Class A common stock, at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, to be issued at the closing of the Global Knowledge Merger (the “Lodbrok Subscription Agreement”). The obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Lodbrok Subscription Agreement are conditioned upon, among other things, customary closing conditions and the consummation of the Global Knowledge Merger. The agreement is based on a stated purchase price for a fixed number of shares, therefore the agreement is equity classified.

The Employment Agreement provides for a two-year initial term, which will be automatically extended for successive one-year periods unless either party provides at least six months’ notice of non-renewal.

Employees
 
We currently have two officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period to our company will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following July 1, 2024, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
