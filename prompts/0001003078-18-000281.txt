 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
 General

MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “MSC,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a leading North American distributor of metalworking and maintenance, repair and operations (“MRO”) products and services.  With a history of driving innovation in industrial product distribution for more than 75 years, we help solve our manufacturing customers’ metalworking, MRO and operational challenges. Through our technical metalworking expertise and inventory management and other supply chain solutions, our team of more than 6,500 associates keeps our customers’ manufacturing operations up and running and improves their efficiency, productivity and profitability.
 We serve a broad range of customers throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, from individual machine shops to Fortune 100 manufacturing companies to government agencies such as the United States General Services Administration and the United States Department of Defense. We operate a sophisticated network of 12 customer fulfillment centers (eight in the United States, three in Canada and one in the U.K.) and 100 branch offices (99 in the United States and one in the U.K.). Our primary customer fulfillment centers are located in or near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Atlanta, Georgia; Elkhart, Indiana; Reno, Nevada; and Columbus, Ohio in the United States.  In addition, we operate seven smaller customer fulfillment centers in or near Hanover Park, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Shelbyville, Kentucky (repackaging and replenishment center); Wednesbury, England; Edmonton, Canada; Beamsville, Canada; and Moncton, Canada. 
 We offer approximately 1,645,000 active, saleable stock-keeping units (“SKUs”) through our catalogs; brochures; eCommerce channels, including our website, mscdirect.com (“MSC website”); our inventory management solutions; and call-centers and branches. We carry many of the products we sell in our inventory, so that orders for these in-stock products are processed and fulfilled the day the order is received. We offer next-day delivery nationwide for qualifying orders placed by 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (excluding Class C (“Consumables”) category products).  Our customers can choose among many convenient ways to place orders: mscdirect.com, eProcurement platforms, call-centers or direct communication with our outside sales associates.
 We believe that our value-added solutions approach to driving our customers’ success serves to differentiate MSC from traditional transaction-focused distributors. We endeavor to save our customers money when they partner with us for their MRO and metalworking product needs. We focus on building strong partnerships with our customers to help them improve their productivity and growth. We do this several ways:

  ﻿
 Industry Overview
 ﻿

MSC operates in a large, fragmented industry. National, regional and local distributors, retail outlets, small distributorships, online distributors, direct mail suppliers, large warehouse stores and manufacturers’ own sales forces all serve MRO customers. 
 ﻿

Nearly every industrial and service business has an ongoing need for MRO supplies. These businesses, with the exception of the largest industrial plants, often do not have the resources to manage and monitor their MRO inventories effectively. They spend more than necessary to purchase and track their supplies, providing an opportunity for MSC to serve as their one-stop MRO product supplier. Even the larger facilities often store their supplies in multiple locations, so they often carry excess inventories and duplicate purchase orders. In many organizations, multiple people often acquire the same item in small quantities via expensive, one-off purchases, resulting in higher purchasing costs and administrative efforts to keep track of supplies. 
 ﻿

With limited capital availability, and limited eCommerce capabilities and operating leverage, smaller industrial distributors are under increasing pressure to consolidate and/or curtail services and product lines to remain competitive. Their challenge represents MSC’s opportunity. We improve purchasing efficiency and reduce costs for our customers because our offerings enable our customers to consolidate suppliers, purchase orders and invoices, and reduce inventory tracking, stocking decisions, purchases and out-of-stock situations.  In addition, through Vendor Managed Inventory (“VMI”), Customer Managed Inventory (“CMI”) and vending solutions, we empower our customers to utilize sophisticated inventory management solutions.
 ﻿
 Business Strategy
 ﻿

MSC’s business strategy is based on helping our customers become more productive and profitable by reducing their total cost for purchasing, using and maintaining MRO supplies. Our customer-focused culture and high-touch engagement model drives value for our customers and results in deep customer relationships. Our strategy includes the following key elements:
 ﻿

Inventory Management Solutions. Our approach starts with a thorough customer assessment. Our expert associates develop and recommend solutions that provide exceptional value to the customer. Depending on the customer’s size and needs, we customize options to address complexity and processes, as well as specific products, technical issues and cost targets. The options include eProcurement, CMI, VMI, vending, tool crib control, or part-time or full-time on-site resources. Our world-class sourcing, logistics and business systems provide predictable, reliable and scalable service.
 ﻿

Broad Selection of Products. Customers want a full range of product options, even as they look to reduce the number of suppliers they partner with. We provide “good-better-best” alternatives, comprising a spectrum of brand name, MSC exclusive brand and generic MRO products. MSC’s broad selection of products enables customers to choose the right combination of price and quality on every purchase to meet their needs.  
 ﻿

Same-Day Shipping and Next-Day Delivery. We guarantee same-day shipping of our core metalworking and MRO products, enabling customers to reduce supply inventories. We fulfill our same-day shipment guarantee about 99% of the time. We offer next-day delivery nationwide for qualifying orders placed by 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (excluding Class 

 
2

C category products). We know that our customers value this service, and areas accessible by next-day delivery generate significantly greater sales for MSC than areas where next-day delivery is not available.  
 ﻿

Superior Customer Service. Our commitment to customer service starts with our more than 6,500 associates who share their deep expertise and knowledge of metalworking and MRO products to help our customers achieve greater success. We invest in sophisticated information systems and provide extensive training to empower our associates to better support our customers. Using our proprietary customer support software, our in-bound sales representatives: can inform customers on a real-time basis of product availability; recommend substitute products; verify credit information; receive special, custom or manufacturer direct orders; cross‑check inventory items using previously entered customer product codes; and arrange or provide technical assistance. We offer: customized billing; customer savings reports; electronic data interchange ordering; eCommerce capabilities; bulk discounts; and stocking of specialty items requested by customers.
 ﻿
 Technical Support. We provide technical support and one-on-one service through our field and customer care center representatives.  We have a dedicated team of nearly 100 metalworking specialists who work with customers to improve their manufacturing processes and efficiency, as well as a technical support team that provides assistance to our sales teams and customers via phone and email. Our customers recognize the value of a distributor that can provide technical support to improve their operations and productivity.
 ﻿

Commitment to Technological Innovation. We embrace technological innovations to support our growth, improve customer service and reduce our operating costs. The innovations make our buying practices more effective, improve our automated inventory replenishment and streamline order fulfillment. MSC’s proprietary software helps our customers and sales representatives determine the availability of products in real time and evaluate alternative products and pricing. The MSC website contains a searchable online catalog with electronic ordering capabilities. The MSC website also offers an array of services, workflow management tools and related information. 
 ﻿

We also continually upgrade our distribution methods and systems and provide comprehensive electronic ordering capabilities (“EDI” and “XML”) to support our customers’ purchase order processing. We continue to invest in our VMI, CMI and vending solutions that streamline customer replenishment and trim our customers’ inventories. Our vending solutions include different kinds of machines, such as storage lockers or carousels, which can stand alone or be combined with other machines.  MSC vending machines use network or web-based software to enable customers to gain inventory visibility, save time and drive profitability.
 ﻿
 Advanced Technologies and www.mscdirect.com.  The MSC website (www.mscdirect.com) is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, providing personalized real-time inventory availability, superior search capabilities, online bill payment, delivery tracking status and other enhancements, including work-flow management tools. The user-friendly search engine allows customers to find SKUs by keyword, part description, competitive part number, vendor number or brand. The MSC website is a key component of our strategy to reduce our customers’ transaction costs and delivery time. 
 ﻿
 Competitive Pricing.  Customers increasingly evaluate their total cost of purchasing, using and maintaining industrial supplies and recognize that price is an important aspect of their procurement costs. We make sure our pricing is competitive while reflecting the value that we bring through our comprehensive services.
 ﻿
 Growth Strategy
 ﻿
 Our growth strategy includes a number of tactics to continue to gain market share.  These include the following:
 ﻿
 Expanding and enhancing our metalworking capabilities to aggressively penetrate customers in heavy and light manufacturing. MSC is a leading distributor of metalworking products in the United States. We have continued to expand our metalworking sales team, increase technical support and enhance supplier relationships. We are developing high-performance metalworking products marketed under MSC exclusive brands, providing high-value product alternatives for our customers.  Our metalworking field specialists and centralized technical support team members have diverse backgrounds in machining, programming, management and engineering. They help our customers select the right tool for the job from our deep supplier base and exclusive brands.
 ﻿
 Expanding programs for government and national account customers. Although MSC has been providing MRO and metalworking supplies to the commercial sector for more than 75 years, we have more recently focused on government customers and have a large, growing contract business with numerous federal, state, and local education agencies. We have developed customized government and national account programs. Even with our recent success, we see plenty of opportunity for additional growth in this area. 
 ﻿


 
3

We provide customized national account programs for larger customers, often as enterprise-wide engagements. These national account customers value our ability to support their procurement needs electronically to reduce their transactional costs. Our dedicated national account managers and operations experts provide supply chain solutions that reduce these customers’ total costs of procurement and ownership through increased visibility into their MRO purchases and improved management. We demonstrate these savings by providing these customers with detailed reporting at both the enterprise and site level.
 ﻿

Increasing the size and improving the productivity of our direct sales force. We have invested resources to give our sales representatives more time with our customers and provide increased support during the MRO purchasing process. At September 1, 2018, our field sales and service associate headcount was 2,383 and our in-bound sales representative headcount was 933.  Beginning in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2018, field sales and service personnel includes all customer-facing associates in an external sales or service role. We believe that our sales force investment has played a critical role in boosting our market share. 
 ﻿
 Increasing sales from existing customers and generating new customers with various value‑added programs. Our value‑added programs include business needs analysis, inventory management solutions and workflow management tools.  Our customers particularly value our industrial vending solutions that can accommodate a range of products from precision cutting tools to MRO supplies. 
 ﻿
 Increasing the number of product lines and productive SKUs. We offer approximately 1,645,000 active, saleable SKUs through our catalogs; brochures; eCommerce channels, including our MSC website; our inventory management solutions; and call-centers and branches. We are increasing the breadth and depth of our product offerings and pruning non-value-added SKUs. In fiscal year 2018, we added approximately 80,000 SKUs, net of SKU removals, to our active, saleable SKU count. We plan to continue adding SKUs in fiscal 2019. 
 ﻿
 The most recent MSC catalog issued in September 2018 merchandises approximately 500,000 core metalworking and MRO products, which are included in the SKU totals above. Approximately 29% of these SKUs are MSC exclusive brands. We also leverage the depth and breadth of MSC’s product portfolio within our Class C category sales channel.
 ﻿
 Improving our marketing programs. MSC has built an extensive buyer database, which we use to prospect for new customers. We deliver our master catalogs to the best prospects. We supplement our master catalogs with direct mail, digital and search engine marketing, and email. Our industry-specific expertise allows us to focus our outreach on the most promising growth areas. 
 ﻿
 Enhancing eCommerce capabilities. The MSC website is a proprietary, business-to-business, horizontal marketplace serving the metalworking and MRO market. The MSC website allows customers to enjoy added convenience without sacrificing customized service. The MSC website is a key component of our strategy to reduce customers’ transaction costs and internal requisition time. Most orders move directly from the customer’s desktop to our customer fulfillment center floor, removing human error, reducing handling costs and speeding up the transaction flow. MSC continues to evaluate the MSC website and solicit customer feedback, making on-going improvements to ensure that it remains a premier website in our marketplace. ​ The MSC website provides advanced features, such as order approval (workflow) and purchase order control, that our customers interact with in order to derive business value beyond merely placing an order.  Many large customer accounts transact business with MSC using eProcurement solution providers that sell a suite of eCommerce products. We have associations with many of these providers and continue to evaluate and expand our eProcurement capabilities.
 ﻿
 Improving our excellent customer support service. MSC consistently receives high customer satisfaction ratings, according to customer surveys. We don’t just strive to meet our customers’ service needs, we work to anticipate them. This focus on our customers’ needs makes us stand apart in the market. We use customer comment cards, surveys and other customer outreach tools, using their feedback to drive the next generation of improvements to the customer experience. 
    
Selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions. MSC is a leader in the highly fragmented industrial distribution market with significant opportunities for organic and acquisitive growth. We actively pursue strategic acquisitions that deepen our metalworking expertise, extend our capabilities into strategic adjacencies, and expand our markets in North America. In April 2018, MSC completed the acquisition of All Integrated Solutions (“AIS”). AIS is a leading value-added distributor of industrial fasteners and components, MRO supplies and assembly tools based in Franksville, Wisconsin. AIS delivers production fasteners and custom tool and fastener solutions for use in the assembly of manufactured commercial and consumer products. The company’s more than 135 associates serve customers in a region that includes Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana and North Dakota. MSC plans to provide AIS’s customer base with its 1.6 million product portfolio to support their full metalworking and MRO needs. Similarly, MSC will extend AIS’s production fastener 

 
4

and VMI solutions to its manufacturing customers that share a common footprint. AIS provides a solid growth platform for expansion in the production fasteners market, complementing our robust Class C fastener and VMI solutions.  AIS’s revenue in calendar 2017 was approximately $66 million. In July 2017, MSC completed the acquisition of DECO Tool Supply Co. (“DECO”), an industrial supply distributor based in Davenport, Iowa. DECO associates work across 10 branch offices located primarily in the Midwest. DECO’s sales force and branch footprint complement MSC’s coverage in the region. MSC will be able to provide DECO customers access to MSC's product portfolio to support their full metalworking and MRO needs. The acquisition enhances our metalworking business, because DECO associates bring considerable experience and expertise in metalworking solutions. 
 ﻿
 Products
 ﻿
 Our broad range of MRO products includes cutting tools, measuring instruments, tooling components, metalworking products, fasteners, flat stock, raw materials, abrasives, machinery hand and power tools, safety and janitorial supplies, plumbing supplies, materials handling products, power transmission components, and electrical supplies. Our large and growing number of SKUs makes us an increasingly valuable partner to our customers as they look to trim their supplier base. Our assortment from multiple product suppliers and MSC exclusive brands, prices and quality levels enables our customers to select from “good-better-best” options on nearly all their purchases. We stand apart from our competitors by offering name brand, exclusive brand, and generic products; depth in our core product lines; and competitive pricing.
 ﻿
 We purchase substantially all our products directly from approximately 3,000 suppliers. No single supplier accounted for more than 6% of our total purchases in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, or fiscal 2016.
 ﻿
 Customer Fulfillment Centers
 ﻿
 We have been enhancing our distribution efficiency and capabilities for decades. When our customers order an in- stock product online or via phone, we ship it the day the order is placed 99% of the time. We do that through our 12 customer fulfillment centers and 100 branch offices. Some specialty or custom items and very large orders are shipped directly from the manufacturer. We manage our primary customer fulfillment centers via computer‑based SKU tracking systems and radio frequency devices that locate specific stock items to make the selection process more efficient. 
 ﻿
 Sales and Marketing
 ﻿

We serve individual machine shops, Fortune 100 companies, government agencies and manufacturers of all sizes. We focus on relatively higher-margin, lower-volume products. With our acquisitions of AIS in fiscal 2018 and Barnes Distribution North America in fiscal 2013, we have increased our presence in the fastener and Class C product categories and significantly increased our presence in the VMI space. VMI involves not only the selling of the maintenance consumables by our associates, but also the management of appropriate stock levels for the customer, writing the necessary replenishment orders, putting away the stock, and maintaining a clean and organized inventory area.  
 ﻿

Federal government customers include the U.S. Postal Service, the Department of Defense, large and small military bases, Veterans Affairs hospitals, and federal correctional facilities. We have individual state contracts but also are engaged in several state cooperatives.


Our national account program also includes Fortune 100 companies, large privately held companies, and international companies doing business in the United States.  We have identified hundreds of additional national account prospects and have given our sales team tools to ensure we are targeting prospective customers that best fit the MSC model.
    
We have implemented advanced analytics and significantly increased the return on our direct marketing investments designed to acquire new customers and increase our share of business with current customers. While master catalogs, promotional catalogs and brochures continue to play an important role in our efforts, we accelerated a shift to search engine marketing, email marketing and online advertising to address changes in our customers’ buying behavior.  We use our own database of over three million contacts together with external mailing lists to target buyers with the highest likelihood to buy.  
 ﻿

Our sales representatives are highly trained and experienced individuals who build relationships with customers, assist customers in reducing costs, provide and coordinate technical support, coordinate special orders and shipments with vendors, and update customer account profiles in our information systems databases. Our marketing approach centers on the ability of our sales representatives, armed with our comprehensive databases as a resource, to respond effectively to the customer’s needs. When a customer places a call to MSC, the sales representative on the other end of the line has immediate access to that customer’s company and specific buyer profile, which includes billing and purchasing track records, and plant and industry information. Meanwhile, the sales representative has access to inventory levels on every SKU we carry. 


 
5

﻿

Our in-bound sales representatives at our customer care centers undergo an intensive seven-week training course, followed up by regular on-site training seminars and workshops. We monitor and evaluate our sales associates at regular intervals, and provide our sales associates with technical training by our in-house specialists and product vendors. We maintain a separate technical support group dedicated to answering customer inquiries and assisting our customers with product operation information and finding the most efficient solutions to manufacturing problems.
     Branch Offices
 ﻿

We operate 100 branch offices. There are 99 branch offices within the United States located in 42 states, and one located in the U.K. We have experienced higher sales growth and market penetration in areas around our branch offices and believe they play an integral role in obtaining new accounts and penetrating existing ones. This includes seven branch offices added with the acquisition of AIS in April 2018. 
 ﻿
 Publications
 ﻿
 Our primary reference publications are our master catalogs, which are supported by specialty and promotional catalogs and brochures. MSC produces two annual catalogs: the MSC Big Book, which contains a comprehensive offering across all product lines; and the MSC Metalworking catalog.  We use specialty and promotional publications to target customers in specific areas, such as metal fabrication, facilities management, safety and janitorial. Specialty and promotional catalogs, targeted to our best prospects, offer a more focused selection of products at a lower catalog production cost and more efficient use of advertising space.
 ﻿

We periodically balance ongoing strategies to improve direct marketing productivity and increase return on advertising dollars spent against programs to increase revenue and lifetime value. While master catalogs, promotional catalogs and brochures continue to play an important role in our efforts, we continue to experience a shift to search engine marketing, email marketing and online advertising to address changes in our customers’ buying behavior.  As such, our mailing volume has trended down as shown below:

  ﻿
 Customer Service
 ﻿

One of our goals is to make purchasing our products as convenient as possible.  Customers submit more than 60% of their orders digitally through our technology platforms (website, vending machines, and eProcurement).  The remaining orders are primarily placed via telephone, fax and mail. The efficient handling of orders is a critical aspect of our business. Order entry and fulfillment occurs at each of our branches and our main customer care centers, mostly located at our customer fulfillment centers. Customer care phone representatives enter non-digital orders into computerized order processing systems. In the event of a local or regional breakdown, a call can usually be re-routed to an alternative location. When an order enters the system, a credit check is performed; if the credit is approved, the order is usually transmitted to the customer fulfillment center closest to the customer. Customers are invoiced for merchandise, shipping and handling promptly after shipment.
 ﻿
 Information Systems
 ﻿

Our information systems enable us to centralize management of key functions, including communication links between customer fulfillment centers; inventory and accounts receivable; purchasing; pricing; sales and distribution; and the preparation of daily operating control reports. These systems help us ship on a same-day basis, respond quickly to order changes, provide a high level of customer service, and reduce costs. Our eCommerce environment is built upon a combined platform of our own intellectual property, state-of-the-art software from the world’s leading internet technology providers and world-class product data. This powerful combination of resources helps us deliver a superior online shopping experience with extremely high levels of reliability.
 ﻿


 
6

Most of our information systems operate in real time over a wide area network, letting each customer fulfillment center and branch office share information and monitor daily progress on sales activity, credit approval, inventory levels, stock balancing, vendor returns, order fulfillment and other performance measures. We maintain a sophisticated buying and inventory management system that monitors all our SKUs and automatically purchases inventory from vendors for replenishment based on projected customer ordering models. We also maintain an Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”) purchasing program with our vendors to boost order placement efficiency, reduce order cycle processing time, and increase order accuracy.
 ﻿

In addition to developing the proprietary computer software programs for use in the customer service and distribution operations, we also provide a comprehensive EDI and Extensible Markup Language (“XML”) ordering system to support our customer-based purchase order processing. We also maintain a proprietary hardware and software platform to support our VMI program, which allows customers to integrate scanner‑accumulated orders directly into our Sales Order Entry system and website. Our CMI program enables customers to simply and effectively replenish inventory by submitting orders directly to our website. Our customized vending systems are used by customers in manufacturing plants across the United States to help them achieve supply chain and shop floor optimization, through inventory management and reduced tooling and labor costs. Our VMI, CMI and vending capabilities function directly as front-end ordering systems for our e-Portal-based customers. These solutions take advantage of advanced technologies built upon the latest innovations in wireless and cloud-based computing.
 ﻿

Our core business systems run in a highly distributed computing environment and utilize world-class software and hardware platforms from key partners.  We utilize disaster recovery techniques and procedures, which are consistent with best practices in enterprise information technology (“IT”). Given such a distributed IT environment, we regularly review and upgrade our systems. We believe that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates are adequate to support our current needs. In fiscal 2017, we went live on our upgraded core financial systems and in fiscal 2018 we went live on a new Human Resources platform.  We are continuing to upgrade our systems and plan to make investments as necessary to enhance our operational effectiveness.
 ﻿

With the advent of advanced mobile technologies such as smart phones and tablets, access to information and decision-making can now be made anytime, anywhere. Recognizing this need, we have deployed technology to securely manage and maintain access to enterprise information from mobile devices that meet our security standards. Our sales representatives are equipped with proprietary mobile technology that allows them to tap into MSC’s supply chain directly from our customers’ manufacturing plants and make sure that critical inventory is always on site and available. In addition, we are enhancing our customer websites and portals to reflect this new mobile reality at a pace in line with customer adoption of mobile technology.
 ﻿

Our customer care centers and branch offices implemented a state-of-the-art phone system and workforce optimization platform in fiscal 2017. The features within the platform create a seamless environment equipped with advanced applications that assist our associates in optimizing our customers’ experience. The architecture has established a dynamic infrastructure that is scalable both in terms of operations and future capabilities. We are continuing to implement additional functionality aimed at enhancing the engagement and personalization of the customer experience regardless of the contact method chosen.
 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿

The MRO supply industry is a large, fragmented industry that is highly competitive. We face competition from: traditional channels of distribution, such as retail outlets; small dealerships; regional and national distributors utilizing direct sales forces; manufacturers of MRO supplies; large warehouse stores; and larger direct mail distributors. We also face substantial competition in the online distribution space that competes with price transparency. In addition, new entrants in the MRO supply industry could increase competition.  We believe that sales of MRO supplies will become more concentrated over the next few years, which may make MRO supply distribution more competitive. Some of our competitors challenge us with a large variety of product offerings, greater financial resources, additional services, or a combination of these factors. In the industrial products market, customer purchasing decisions are based primarily on one or more of the following criteria: price, product selection, product availability, technical support relationship, level of service and convenience. We believe we compete effectively on all such criteria.
 ﻿
 Seasonality
 ﻿
 During any given time, we may be impacted by our industrial customers’ plant shutdowns, particularly during the summer months (our fourth fiscal quarter), as well as the winter months for the Christmas and New Year holiday period (our fiscal second quarter). In addition, we may be impacted by weather-related disruptions.

﻿
 Compliance with Health and Safety and Environmental Protection Laws
 ﻿
 Our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal, state, local and non-U.S. health and safety and environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure that our operations are compliant with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
 ﻿
 Operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal and recurring part of our operations. With respect to all other matters that may currently be pending, in the opinion of management, based on our analysis of relevant facts and circumstances, compliance with applicable environmental laws is not likely to have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
 ﻿
 Associates
 ﻿

As of September 1, 2018, we employed 6,657 associates, which includes our U.K. and Canada operations. No associate is represented by a labor union. We consider our relationships with associates to be good and have experienced no work stoppages.
 ﻿
 Available Information
 ﻿
 We file annual, quarterly and current reports, and other reports and documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The public may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at Station Place, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
