ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Founded in 1992, Anika Therapeutics, Inc. is a global joint preservation company that creates and delivers meaningful advancements in early intervention orthopedic care. Based on our collaborations with clinicians to understand what they need most to treat their patients, we develop minimally invasive products that restore active living for people around the world. We are committed to leading in high opportunity spaces within orthopedics, including osteoarthritis (or OA) pain management, regenerative solutions, soft tissue repair and bone preserving joint technologies.
 
We have thirty years of global expertise developing, manufacturing and commercializing products based on our hyaluronic acid, or HA, technology platform. HA is a naturally occurring polymer found throughout the body that is vital for proper joint health and tissue function. Our proprietary technologies for modifying the HA molecule allow product properties to be tailored specifically to multiple uses, including enabling longer residence time to support OA pain management and creating a solid form of HA called Hyaff, which is the platform for some of our regenerative solutions portfolio.
 
In early 2020, we expanded our overall technology platform, product portfolio, and significantly expanded our commercial infrastructure, especially in the United States, through our strategic acquisitions of Parcus Medical, LLC, or Parcus Medical, a sports medicine and instrumentation solutions provider focused on soft tissue repair, and Arthrosurface, Inc., or Arthrosurface, a company specializing in bone preserving partial and total joint replacement solutions. These acquisitions have ignited the transformation of our company by augmenting our HA-based OA pain management and regenerative products with a broad suite of products and capabilities focused on early intervention joint preservation primarily in upper and lower extremities such as shoulder, foot/ankle, knee and hand/wrist.

Strategy
 
Beginning in 2020, we launched our transformational strategy to expand and diversify our revenue in the global joint preservation markets. This multi-year journey began with the acquisitions of Arthrosurface and Parcus Medical, through which we entered into the sports medicine soft tissue repair and bone preserving joint technology markets, added to our existing leadership position in the HA based OA pain management market, focusing on building a strong leadership team, and enhanced our commercial organization and infrastructure with investments in people, systems and processes. In the upcoming years, we will continue to invest in our research and development pipeline and strengthen our commercial capabilities to position our product portfolio for the needs of clinicians that practice in ambulatory surgical centers (or ASCs) and hospitals, as well as expand into new geographic areas to drive accelerated growth and profitability. As our pipeline evolves, we intend to leverage our HA expertise in selectively developing and offering solutions for joint preservation and regenerative solutions targeted at procedures that are performed in the ASCs and to focus on completing the clinical trials for key products we sell outside the United States, (i.e. Cingal and Hyalofast), to gain approval for entry into the large U.S. market.   
 
Through the acquisition of Parcus Medical and Arthrosurface, we expanded our addressable global market from the over $1 billion global OA pain management market to the over $8 billion global joint preservation market (which includes faster growing sports medicine and extremities segments), advanced our commercial capabilities, instituted systems and processes to support our transformation, and expanded our product pipeline and research and development expertise in these target markets.
 
As we look towards the future, our business is positioned to capture value within our target markets in joint preservation. We believe our future success will be driven by our:

Joint Preservation and Restoration 
 
Our Joint Preservation and Restoration product family consists of: 
 

● | Bone Preserving Joint Technologies. Our portfolio of more than 150 bone preserving joint technologies, including partial joint replacement, joint resurfacing, and minimally invasive and bone sparing implants, is designed to treat upper and lower extremity orthopedic conditions as well as knee and hip conditions caused by arthritic disease, trauma and injury. These products span multiple joints including the shoulder, foot/ankle, wrist, knee and hip and are generally intended to restore a patient’s natural anatomy and movement. These products are often used to treat patients with OA progression beyond where our OA Pain Management products can allow the patients to retain an active lifestyle when early surgical intervention becomes preferable.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Soft Tissue Repair. Our line of soft tissue repair solutions is used by surgeons to repair and reconstruct damaged ligaments and tendons resulting from sports injuries, trauma and disease. These more traditional sports medicine solutions include screws, sutures, suture anchors, grafts and other surgical systems that facilitate surgical procedures on the shoulder, knee, hip, upper and lower extremities, and other soft tissues.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Regenerative Solutions. Our portfolio of orthopedic regenerative solutions leveraging our proprietary technologies based on HA and Hyaff, which is a solid form of HA. These products include Tactoset Injectable Bone Substitute, an HA-enhanced injectable bone repair therapy designed to treat insufficiency fractures and for augmenting hardware fixation, such as suture anchors and Hyalofast, a biodegradable support for human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells used for cartilage regeneration and as an adjunct for microfracture surgery. Tactoset is commercialized principally in the United States, whereas Hyalofast is CE Mark approved and currently available outside the United States in over 30 countries within Europe, South America, Asia, and certain other international markets. In the United States, Hyalofast is a pipeline product under clinical trial studies and is not available for commercial sale. For additional information, please see the section captioned “Item 1. Business—Research and Development.”
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We currently commercialize Bone Preserving Joint Technologies, Soft Tissue Repair products, and Tactoset (from our Regenerative Solutions portfolio) in the United States by selling to hospitals and ASCs, through an independent network of sales representatives and distributors, and utilize our distributor network for sales in certain international markets.
 
Non-Orthopedic

Our Non-Orthopedic product family consists of legacy HA-based products that are marketed principally for non-orthopedic applications. These products include Hyalobarrier, an anti-adhesion barrier indicated for use after abdomino-pelvic surgeries, Hyalomatrix, used for the treatment of complex wounds such as burns and ulcers, as well as products used in connection with the treatment of ears, nose and throat disorders, and ophthalmic products, including injectable, high molecular weight HA products such as Anikavisc and Nuvisc, used as viscoelastic agents in ophthalmic surgical procedures such as cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. These Non-Orthopedic products are sold through commercial sales and marketing partners around the world.
 
Sales Channels
 
A majority of our products are used by clinicians and surgeons in one of three environments: office-based procedures usually focused on injections, hospital operating rooms and ASCs, which are clinics outside of a normal hospital setting that are often at least partially physician-owned. These medical care delivery environments typically require different commercial approaches and have distinct call points, which requires diversity in our sales approach. For instance, our OA Pain Management product family and certain products in our Non-Orthopedic category are almost entirely utilized in an office-based setting while our Joint Preservation and Restoration and certain of our Non-Orthopedic products are almost exclusively consumed in hospital operating rooms or ASCs.
 
As a result of these distinctions, we employ multiple sales models in the United States to ensure that we are meeting the needs of our customers and other healthcare system stakeholders. For many years, we have maintained a mutually beneficial commercial partnership with Mitek, which sells Orthovisc and Monovisc in the United States. For this arrangement with Mitek, we sell the Orthovisc and Monovisc products that we manufacture to Mitek, and also receive from Mitek a royalty on their end user sales of these products in the United States. We have U.S. commercial partnerships for other products in our OA Pain Management and Non-Orthopedic product families. Under these commercial partnerships, we sell our products directly to our partners, who perform the vast majority of the downstream sales and marketing activities to customers and end-users. In addition to a transfer price, we may also structure our arrangements to receive a royalty on end user sales.
 
    7 

  

With our expanded commercial infrastructure as a result of the Parcus Medical and Arthrosurface acquisitions, we sell our Joint Preservation and Restoration family directly to clinicians, including hospitals and ASCs, through our Anika sales team and large network of independent third-party distributors. During 2020, we completed the initial integration of our U.S. commercial organization including effectively cross training our sales team to sell the consolidated Joint Preservation and Restoration product portfolio. Within this framework, we employ selling models that seek to maximize the benefit for our company and customers, including in certain instances, contracts with group purchasing organizations and certain fixed-price delivery models.
 
Outside of the United States, we market and sell our products using a worldwide network of commercial partners to provide a solid foundation for future revenue growth and territorial expansion. Our relationships with these partners are generally structured such that we sell our products to these partners directly while they, with global support from our team, perform the in-country sales and marketing activities to drive growth and adoption of our products locally. We expect to generally maintain this model for the foreseeable future, while also selectively evaluating other options and being opportunistic about adopting other sales models, including direct sales, in certain jurisdictions.
 
We believe that our overall sales approach provides our business with a strong base to drive revenue growth as we continue to grow and scale our commercial infrastructure. We will continue to focus on expanding our own commercial capabilities, including with respect to market access, innovative sales and delivery models, and improved logistics management.
 
Manufacturing
 
We manufacture all of our HA-based products, including all of our OA Pain Management products and certain additional products, at our facility in Bedford, Massachusetts, where we have developed significant manufacturing expertise around procedures such as homogenized mixing and filling of highly-viscous liquids and manipulation of solid HA into scaffolds or other presentations. We manufacture most of our soft tissue repair products at our facility in Sarasota, Florida and we manufacture our bone preserving joint products and certain elements of our soft tissue repair portfolio utilizing third-party contract manufacturing organizations.
 
The raw materials necessary to manufacture our products are generally available from multiple sources. However, we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain key raw materials and a small number of suppliers for certain other materials, components, parts and disposables required for the manufacturing and delivery of these products. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our supply chain as the companies that produce our products, product components or otherwise support our manufacturing processes, the distribution centers where we manage our inventory, or the operations of our logistics and other service providers, including third parties that sterilize and store our products, are disrupted, temporarily close or experience worker shortages for a sustained period of time. Any prolonged interruption of operations or significant reduction in the capacity or performance capability at any of our manufacturing facilities, or at any of our key suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. For additional information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our manufacturing operations, please refer to the section captioned “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to the COVID-19 Pandemic. “Our operations are located in areas impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and those operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic”, and “Our global supply chain may be materially adversely impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.”
 
Research and Development 
 
Our research and development efforts consist of the development of new medical applications for our technology platforms, including new implant designs, the development of intellectual property with respect to our technology platforms and new products, the management of clinical trials for certain product candidates, the preparation and processing of applications for regulatory clearances and approvals, and process development and scale-up manufacturing activities for our existing and new product development initiatives. For 2021, 2020, and 2019, research and development expenses were $27.3 million, $23.4 million and $16.7 million, respectively. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to clinical studies in the United States for Cingal and Hyalofast, certain European post-market clinical studies and regulatory efforts, and activities associated with new product development in our research and development pipeline, including a full year of activities following the acquisitions of Arthrosurface and Parcus Medical in early 2020. We anticipate that we will continue to commit significant resources to research and development activities, primarily for new product development, pre-clinical activities and clinical trials.
 
Our new product development efforts focus on products in four large and growing orthopedic markets to drive long-term growth: OA pain management, regenerative solutions, sports medicine soft tissue repair and bone preserving joint technologies. In order to better inform and target our research and development investment, we routinely interact with key external stakeholders, including clinicians, to encompass customer and patient insights in our development process that help ensure we bring needed solutions to the market. In the near term, our general new product development will be focused on enhancements to existing products such as Tactoset Injectable Bone Substitute, new soft tissue fixation and regenerative solutions and extremities products like our WristMotion® Total Wrist Arthroplasty product that achieved 510(k) clearance during 2020 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or FDA) and launched commercially in 2021, and clinical development to enable us to commercialize our Cingal and Hyalofast products in the U.S. market (these products are currently sold only outside the United States). As we move forward, we plan to continue to invest in novel and meaningful new products for our target markets based on our core capabilities, including further expanding our regenerative HA technology platform.
 
Our development focus for OA pain management will continue to be on bringing Cingal, our third-generation, single-injection viscosupplement product, to the U.S. market. While we have conducted previous clinical trials for Cingal, including a trial that supported CE Mark approval for Cingal, the FDA has indicated an additional Phase III trial is necessary to support U.S. regulatory approval. In 2020, we initiated a pilot study to confirm our trial design to increase our probability of success in a Phase III trial and generate data that ultimately will be needed to support FDA approval and clearances. We completed enrollment for the Cingal pilot study in November 2021. We expect to finalize the review of the data related to the pilot trial in the middle of 2022. The results of the data will inform the design of a possible pivotal trial which would be expected to begin thereafter. Given the evolving environment, we will continue to update clinical trial timelines as we have more visibility with respect to the length and regional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our Cingal pilot study, please refer to the section captioned “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our development activities, preclinical studies and clinical trials, which could significantly impair our long-term business plans and operating results.”

Development for our Joint Preservation and Restoration product family is focused in several areas. We continue to progress the ongoing clinical trial to support approval in the United States for Hyalofast, our single stage, off the shelf, cartilage repair therapy, currently sold only outside the United States. We are actively pursuing multiple solutions to accelerate patient enrollment, including initiating sites in Mexico, Indonesia, and the Philippines which has been delayed due to COVID-19. We are also focused on the development of additional solutions and line extensions for our soft tissue repair and bone preserving joint technologies business, largely within the faster-growing extremities segments such as the shoulder. These include continued progress on a therapy targeted at rotator cuff repair utilizing our proprietary solid HA technology, as well as other programs that leverage our HA expertise to augment or improve our current offerings.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We seek patent and trademark protection for our key technologies, products and product improvements, both in the U.S. and in select foreign countries. When determined appropriate, we enforce and plan to enforce and defend our patent and trademark rights. While we rely on our patent and trademark portfolio to provide us with competitive advantages as it relates to our existing and future product lines, it is not our sole source of protection. We also rely upon trade secrets and continuing technological innovations to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Governmental Regulation
 
The clinical development, manufacturing, and marketing of our products are subject to governmental regulation in the United States, the European Union, and other territories worldwide. Various statutes, regulations and interpretations thereof, directives, and guidelines, including the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in the United States, govern the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, premarket clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, advertising, and promotion of our products. Product development and approval/clearance within these various regulatory frameworks can take a number of years and generally involves the expenditure of substantial resources. Pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers are also inspected regularly by the FDA and other applicable regulatory bodies.
 
Medical products regulated by the FDA are generally classified as drugs, biologics, or medical devices, and the current classification standards for our current or future products may be altered over time. Drugs and biologic products undergo rigorous preclinical testing prior to beginning clinical trials. Clinical trials for new drugs or biologic products include Phase I trials in healthy volunteers to understand safety, dosage tolerance, and pharmacokinetics, Phase II trials in a limited patient population to identify initial efficacy and side effects, and Phase III pivotal trials to statistically evaluate the safety and efficacy of the product. Medical devices intended for human use are classified into three categories (Class I, II or III) on the basis of the controls deemed reasonably necessary by the FDA to assure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices typically do not require prior approval by a regulatory authority. Class II devices are cleared for marketing under the pre-market notification 510(k) regulatory pathway, which may include clinical testing. Class III devices require pre-market approval based on valid scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness, including evidence elicited through appropriate clinical testing. The failure to adequately demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of a product under development can delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product. In order to gain marketing approval, we must submit to the relevant regulatory authority for review information on the quality aspects of the product as well as the non-clinical and clinical data. The FDA undertakes this review in the United States. Regardless of classification, medical device manufacturers are subject to multiple regulations and standards specifying that a quality system must provide oversight to the design and manufacture of devices intended for human use.
 
In the European Union, medical devices must be CE Marked in order to be marketed. CE marking a device involves working with a Notified Body, and in some cases a Competent Authority, to demonstrate that the device meets all applicable requirements of the Medical Devices Directive and that the Quality Management System is compliant. Europe’s Medical Device Directive, or MDD, has been replaced by the European Medical Device Regulation, or MDR, enacted in 2017, and became effective in May 2021. MDR requirements will phase in on a product-by-product basis as certifications under MDD lapse and will require all products to undergo review and approval under these new regulations no later than May 2024, which will generally require increased levels of clinical support as compared to MDD requirements. Drug approval in the European Union follows one of several possible processes: (i) a centralized procedure involving members of the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use; (ii) a “mutual recognition procedure” in which an individual country's regulatory agency approves the product followed by “mutual recognition” of this approval by regulatory agencies of other countries; or (iii) a decentralized procedure in which the approval is sought through the regulatory agencies of multiple countries at the same time.

Approval timelines can range from several months to several years, or applications can be denied entirely. Product or product component classifications as drugs, biologics, or medical devices may change over time due to new regulations or augmented interpretation of data or current regulations. The approval process can be affected by a number of factors. For example, additional studies or clinical trials may be requested during the review, which may delay marketing approval and involve unbudgeted costs. As a condition of approval, the regulatory agency may require post-marketing surveillance to monitor for adverse effects, and may require other additional studies, as it deems appropriate. After approval for an initial indication, further clinical studies are generally necessary to gain approval for any additional indications. The terms of any approval, including labeling content, may be more restrictive than expected and could affect the marketability of a product.
 
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, including, without limitation, issuing an FDA Form 483 notice of inspectional observations or a warning letter, imposing civil money penalties, suspending or delaying issuance of approvals, requiring product recall, imposing a total or partial shutdown of production, withdrawal of approvals or clearances already granted, pursuing product seizures, consent decrees or other injunctive relief, or criminal prosecution through the Department of Justice. The FDA can also require us to repair, replace, or refund the cost of products that we manufactured or distributed. Outside the United States, regulatory agencies may exert a range of similar powers.
 
We are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false claims, and transparency reporting laws. Similar laws and regulations pertaining to sales, marketing and advertising practices exist in the other geographic areas where we operate.
 
We are also subject to various laws and regulations concerning data privacy in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, in the European Union. These regulations impose several requirements on the processing, administration, security, and confidentiality of personal data and empower enforcement agencies to impose large penalties for noncompliance.
 
Environmental Laws
 
We believe that we are in compliance with all foreign, federal, state, and local environmental regulations with respect to our manufacturing facilities. The cost of ongoing compliance with such regulations does not have a material effect on our operations. 
Competition
 
We compete with many companies including large pharmaceutical firms and large and specialized medical device companies across our product lines. For our OA Pain Management products, our principal competitors include Sanofi Genzyme, Zimmer Biomet, Inc., Bioventus Inc., and Ferring Pharmaceuticals, as well as other companies that are commercializing or developing competitive products. Our key competitors for our Joint Preservation and Restoration products include Arthrex, Inc., the DePuy Synthes Companies of Johnson & Johnson, Smith & Nephew PLC., Stryker Corporation, and Zimmer Biomet, Inc., as well as certain smaller organizations that focus on subsets of the larger industry, such as Catalyst OrthoScience, Treace Medical, Paragon 28 and Shoulder Innovations. Many of the larger companies have substantially greater financial resources, larger research and development staffs, more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations, and more experience in the regulatory processes than we have. We also compete with academic institutions, government agencies, and other research organizations that may be involved in the research and development and commercialization of products. Many of our competitors also compete against us in securing relationships with collaborators for their research and development and commercialization programs.
 
We compete with other market participants primarily on the efficacy of our products, our products’ reputation for safety, and the breadth of our overall product portfolio. Other factors that impact competition in our industry are the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, the availability of manufacturing supplies, raw materials and finished product supply, marketing and sales capability, reimbursement coverage, product pricing, and patent protection. Some of the principal factors that may affect our ability to compete in our target markets include:
 

● | The quality and breadth of our continued development of our product portfolio;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our ability to complete successful clinical studies and obtain FDA marketing and foreign regulatory approvals prior to our competitors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our ability to successfully source raw materials and components from suppliers at price points that are in-line with our financial objectives, as well as deliver them on schedule to meet the needs of our operational and commercial organizations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our ability to continue to build our commercial infrastructure, integrate our sales channels and execute our sales strategies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    10 

  


● | The execution by our key partners of their commercial strategies for our products and our ability to manage our relationships with those key partners;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | The availability of capital resources to fund strategic activities related to the significant expansion of our business or product portfolio, including through acquisitions of third parties or certain assets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are aware of a number of companies that are developing and/or marketing competitive products. In some cases, competitors have already obtained product approvals, submitted applications for approval, or commenced human clinical studies, either in the United States or in certain foreign countries. All of our products face substantial competition. There is a risk that we will be unable to compete effectively against our current or future competitors. Additionally, legislation and regulation aimed at curbing rising healthcare costs has resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to create larger companies, including hospitals, with greater market power. In turn, this has led to greater and more intense competition in the provision of products and services to market participants. Important market makers, like group purchasing organizations and integrated delivery networks, have increased their negotiating leverage, and if these market makers demand significant price concessions or if we are excluded as a supplier by these market makers, our product revenue could be adversely impacted.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business is generally not seasonal in nature due to the nature of our product mix and sales channels and strategies.
 
Human Capital Management
 
We believe that creating a diverse, talented, and inclusive workplace is a central aspect to our culture, employee recruitment, retention and engagement, innovation, operational excellence and overall performance. In turn, this culture and drive for performance is an important factor in our ability to attract and retain key talent. Our culture is centered around our fundamental values of:

● | People: We engage and invest in each other in a community that values diversity and inclusion.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Innovation: We are agile and entrepreneurial in developing and delivering meaningful solutions to our healthcare stakeholders within our target markets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Quality: We strive for the highest quality and compliance in everything we do.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Teamwork: We operate with mutual respect and trust, and are collaborative as we grow together.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Integrity: We live up to our promises and do the right thing, every day.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accountability: We are empowered and accountable to deliver results and value to all of our stakeholders.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Talent Acquisition and Management
 
Our industry requires complex processes for product development and commercialization, each of which requires deep expertise and experience across a broad array of disciplines. Medical device companies therefore compete for a limited number of qualified applicants to fill specialized positions. This requires competitive compensation and benefits packages and an attractive culture in order to attract and retain skilled employees to support the growth and success of the company.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 297 fulltime employees in the United States and EMEIA. We expect to continue to add employees in 2022 and beyond as we grow our business.
 
We believe that our employees’ understanding of how their work contributes to our overall strategy and performance is key to our success. In order to communicate with respect to these important topics in a manner that is engaging to our team, we utilize a variety of channels. These include all-employee town hall meetings with senior management, regular email updates from our chief executive officer and other key members of the executive team, as well as presentations to our employees by invited clinicians, who use our products, participate and share their experiences from a customer’s perspective. In addition, to assess employee perceptions in areas such as inclusion, professional development/training, reward/recognition, equity, engagement and overall organizational satisfaction, we conduct company-wide employee engagement surveys using an external survey platform. Our management team evaluates the results and identifies potential opportunities for improvement. As a result of employee feedback, we have established an employee communications taskforce chartered with improving communications and employee engagement across the business and introduced new e-learning programs to expand employee development.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 
We are committed to a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace where all employees, regardless of their gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, age, sexual orientation or identity, education or disability are valued, respected and supported. In 2021, in alignment with our commitment to comply with key elements of the MassBio CEO Pledge for a More Equitable and Inclusive Life Science Industry, we delivered on some of the key deliverables of our multiyear approach. This included the development and communication of a corporate Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy Statement as well as the creation of a Diversity Dashboard. The Diversity Dashboard tracks the current diversity within the organization and is shared with the Board of Directors to provide engagement and oversight at the highest levels of the organization. We will continue to enhance the diversity of our workforce through focused talent acquisition goals and development plans.
Employee Development
 
The ongoing development of our employees continues to be a catalyst for our growth and success as a company. A large number of our employees have obtained advanced degrees in their professions. We support our employees’ further development with individualized development plans, mentoring, coaching, group training, conference attendance. We also provide financial support, including tuition reimbursement for qualified programs, as well as access to a broad-based learning management platform for self-directed learning and improvement.
Competitive Pay and Benefits
 
To attract and retain qualified employees and key talent, we offer our employees total rewards packages consisting of base salary, a cash bonus, and a comprehensive benefit package. We also provide equity compensation for certain employees based on various criteria, including their level within our company. All employees globally are eligible to participate in the annual incentive cash bonus plan or a sales incentive plan which are aligned to both corporate and individual performance. Bonus opportunity and equity compensation increase as a percentage of total compensation based on level of responsibility. Our employee stock purchase plan, introduced in 2021, gives eligible employees the opportunity to purchase shares in Anika at a discounted rate. Bravo, our global online employee recognition program, provides the opportunity for both peer to peer and manager to employee recognition, and has been well received by our employees.
Health and Safety
 
We remain focused on promoting the total wellness of our employees including resources, programs and services to support their physical, mental and financial wellness. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have augmented certain of our normal business practices to ensure that we promote health and safety for our employees. A cross functional COVID-19 Pandemic Task Force has been in place since the start of the pandemic. We have established safety policies and protocols, and we regularly update our employees with respect to any changes. In 2020, we transitioned much of our workforce to work remotely, in order minimize the risk of infection of those who must be onsite to perform their jobs, including our manufacturing team. We also have adjusted attendance policies to encourage those who may be ill to stay home. To further protect our on-site employees, we have provided personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies. Additionally, we engaged a third-party firm to conduct a proactive facility assessment and upgraded our air filtration systems to be more effective against COVID-19 transmission, thus enhancing the safety of our workforce while on the job. We have also provided general information updates and support for our employees to ensure that they have resources and information to protect their health and that of those around them, including their families and co-workers.
Product Liability
 
The testing, marketing, and sale of human health care products entail an inherent risk of allegations of product liability, and we cannot assure that substantial product liability claims will not be asserted against us. Although we have not received any material product liability claims to date, we cannot assure that if material claims arise in the future, our insurance will be adequate to cover all situations. Moreover, we cannot assure that such insurance, or additional insurance, if required, will be available in the future or, if available, will be available on commercially reasonable terms. Any product liability claim, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
