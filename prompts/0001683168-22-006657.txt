Summary
 
B2Digital, Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (“we,” “us,” or, the “Company”), was incorporated in the State of Delaware on June 3, 2004.
 
We are led by a management team headed by our Chairman and CEO, Greg P. Bell. Our management team has over 30 years of global experience developing more than 20 companies in the sports, television, entertainment, digital distribution, and banking transaction industries. As part of our growth strategy, we intend to continue to develop and acquire assets meeting our business model with the goal of becoming a premier vertically integrated live event sports company and fitness brand with many locations throughout the U.S.
 
We are the premier development league for mixed martial arts (“MMA”). We operate in two major branded segments: The B2 Fighting Series and The Official B2 Training Facilities Network, which is comprised of ONE MORE Gym. We primarily derive revenues from live event ticket sales, pay-per-view ticket sales, content media marketing, and fitness facility memberships.
 
The Live Events segment (the B2 Fighting Series) is primarily engaged with scheduling, organizing, and producing live MMA events, marketing those events, and generating both live audience and PPV ticket sales, as well as creatively marketing the archived content generated through its operations in this segment. We own all media rights, merchandising rights, digital distribution networks of the B2 Fighting Series. We also plan to generate additional revenues over time from endorsement deals with global brands as its audience grows. The B2 Fighting Series is licensed in 18 U.S. states to operate LIVE MMA Fights. Most B2 Fighting Series events sell out at the gate.
 
The B2 Training Facilities segment operates primarily through our ONE More Gym brand. We currently operate two ONE More Gym locations. ONE MORE Gym locations include specialized MMA training resources and serve a recruiting function for our Live Events segment.
