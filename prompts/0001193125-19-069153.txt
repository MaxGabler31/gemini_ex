Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving the lives of patients who face challenges associated with their existing treatments for rare and serious chronic disease. Employing our proprietary Transient Permeability Enhancer, or TPE, technology platform, we seek to develop oral medications that are currently available only as injections. We are currently evaluating oral octreotide capsules, conditionally trade-named MYCAPSSA, our sole TPE platform-based clinical product candidate, in two Phase 3 clinical trials in adult patients for the treatment of acromegaly to potentially support regulatory approval in the United States and European Union. Acromegaly is a rare and debilitating condition that results in the bodys production of excess growth hormone. Octreotide is an analog of somatostatin, a natural inhibitor of growth hormone secretion. The current standard of care for patients diagnosed with acromegaly and not otherwise cured by surgical removal of the pituitary tumor consists of lifelong, once-monthly injections of an extended release somatostatin analog. We believe that octreotide capsules, if approved by regulatory authorities, will be the first somatostatin analog available for oral administration. Octreotide capsules have been granted orphan designation in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of acromegaly. The worldwide market for injectable somatostatin analogs is approximately $2.7 billion annually, of which we estimate approximately $810 million represents annual sales for the treatment of acromegaly. We retain worldwide rights to develop and commercialize octreotide capsules with no royalty obligations to third parties. 
 In September 2017, we initiated a third Phase 3 clinical trial for oral octreotide capsules for the maintenance therapy of adult patients with acromegaly following our agreement with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, on the design of the trial, reached through a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, in August 2017. The trial, referred to as CHIASMA OPTIMAL, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, nine-month trial expected to enroll 50 adult acromegaly patients designed to support regulatory approval of octreotide capsules in the United States. In October 2018, we completed enrollment in the CHIASMA OPTIMAL trial, randomizing a total of 56 patients. We expect to release top-line data from this trial in the third quarter of 2019. If the data from CHIASMA OPTIMAL is positive, we plan to resubmit our New Drug Application, or NDA, by year-end 2019. We expect the FDA will aim to complete its review of our anticipated NDA, if accepted

  for filing, within six months based on our expectation that the NDA will be designated a Class 2 resubmission by FDA to address its April 2016 complete response letter, or CRL, to our original NDA. 
 We are also conducting an international Phase 3 clinical trial, referred to as MPOWERED, of oral octreotide capsules for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with acromegaly to support regulatory approval in the European Union. The MPOWERED trial is a randomized, open-label and active-controlled 15-month trial initially designed to enroll up to 150 patients. In July 2018, we completed the enrollment of 135 adult acromegaly patients into the run-in phase of the trial. The European Medicines Agency, or EMA, requested that a minimum of at least 80 patients who are responders to octreotide capsules following the six-month run-in phase be randomized to either remain on octreotide capsules or return to injectable somatostatin receptor ligands (octreotide or lanreotide), and then followed for an additional nine months. In October 2018, 80 patients were randomized following the six-month run-in phase in the MPOWERED trial. In October 2018, we also elected to resume enrollment in the trial in an effort to enroll up to 15 additional patients exclusively located in the United States in order to gain further U.S. investigator and patient experience with octreotide capsules. We expect to complete enrollment in MPOWERED in the second quarter of 2019 and to release top-line data from the MPOWERED trial in the second half of 2020. 
 In order to prepare for our planned NDA resubmission following our anticipated successful completion of the CHIASMA OPTIMAL trial, we believe we have reached an understanding with the FDA on the required NDA content including the integrated summaries of safety and efficacy data from our three Phase 3 clinical trials of oral octreotide capsules. We continue to believe that the data from the CHIASMA OPTIMAL trial alone is designed to address the efficacy concerns raised by the FDA in its CRL to our first NDA submission and that the FDA only expects to review safety data from the MPOWERED trial as part of its review of our planned NDA resubmission. We anticipate that our planned NDA resubmission will be classified by the FDA for a six-month review period. Any future requirement by the FDA to submit additional data including the efficacy data from our MPOWERED clinical trial as part of our planned NDA resubmission may delay or prevent the filing, review or approval of our NDA. 
 Our octreotide capsules product candidate is the first somatostatin analog formulated for oral administration to complete a Phase 3 clinical trial. In November 2014, we completed a multinational, open-label Phase 3 clinical trial of oral octreotide capsules for the treatment of acromegaly. We submitted our original NDA for octreotide capsules in June 2015. In April 2016, the FDA issued a CRL which indicated that the review of our application was complete and that our NDA was not ready for approval in its present form. In June 2016, we participated in an End of Review meeting with the FDA to discuss the concerns the FDA raised in the CRL. In its CRL, the FDA advised us that it did not believe our NDA had provided substantial evidence of efficacy to warrant approval and advised us that we would need to conduct another clinical trial in order to overcome this deficiency. The FDA expressed concerns regarding certain aspects of our single-arm, open-label Phase 3 clinical trial and strongly recommended that we conduct a randomized, double-blind and controlled trial that enrolls patients from the United States and is of sufficiently long duration to ensure that control of disease activity is stable at the time point selected for the primary efficacy assessment. In addition, the FDA advised that, during a site inspection, certain deficiencies were conveyed to the representative of one of our suppliers that would need to be resolved before approval. While the FDA did not note any safety concerns related to octreotide capsules in the CRL, it subsequently indicated in the June 2016 End of Review meeting minutes that the size, duration, dropout rate and absence of a control group in our first Phase 3 trial were factors limiting an overall safety assessment. In the End of Review meeting minutes, the FDA reiterated its strong recommendation for a randomized, double-blind and controlled trial, and introduced the concept of a placebo control as a design element that could address some of the FDAs concerns. 
 In August 2017, we reached agreement with the FDA under a SPA of a new Phase 3 clinical trial of octreotide capsules in adult acromegaly patients, designed to address the concerns previously raised in the CRL and support a potential resubmission of our NDA for octreotide capsules in acromegaly. The trial, referred to as CHIASMA OPTIMAL (Octreotide capsules vs. Placebo Treatment In MultinationAL centers), which we initiated in 
 
2 


  September 2017, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, nine-month clinical trial expected to enroll 50 adult acromegaly patients (at least 20% of whom must be recruited from the United States) whose disease is biochemically controlled, based upon levels of insulin-like growth factor 1, or IGF-1, a byproduct of increased growth hormone, or GH, levels caused by acromegaly, on injectable somatostatin analogs at baseline (average IGF-1 £ 1.0 x upper limit of normal, or ULN). The patients must also have confirmed active acromegaly following their last surgical intervention based upon an elevated IGF-1 at that time of ³ 1.3 x ULN. In October 2018, we completed enrollment in this trial with 56 acromegaly patients in 17 countries, including 21 from the United States. The patients in this trial were randomized on a 1:1 basis to octreotide capsules or placebo. Patients will be dose titrated from 40 mg per day to up to a maximum of 80 mg per day, equaling two capsules in the morning and two capsules in the evening. Patients who meet predefined withdrawal criteria or withdraw from oral treatment in either treatment arm for any reason during the course of the trial will be considered treatment failures; those patients will be offered their original treatment of injections and monitored for the remainder of the trial. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients who maintain their biochemical response compared to placebo at the end of the nine-month double-blind, placebo-controlled period as measured using the average of the last two IGF-1 levels £ 1.0 x ULN. 
 In May 2018, we reached further agreement with the FDA under a SPA Agreement Modification letter providing that the hierarchical secondary endpoints that will be considered by the FDA in evaluating the totality of evidence for octreotide capsules treatment effect now are: 
 

 | Proportion of patients who maintain GH response at week 36 compared to screening;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Time to loss of response: IGF-1 > 1.0× ULN;
--+--------------------------------------------


 | Time to loss of response: IGF-1 > 1.3×ULN; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


 | Proportion of patients requiring rescue treatment.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 We anticipate that the FDA will review the totality of the data collected from the CHIASMA OPTIMAL trial, including both primary and secondary endpoints, together with the data from our other clinical trials of octreotide capsules, and whether the data collected are sufficiently robust to support the interpretability of these analyses, in determining whether to approve any NDA we may submit for octreotide capsules. There can be no assurance that the data collected from the CHIASMA OPTIMAL trial will be sufficient to support approval of any NDA we may submit to allow us to commercialize octreotide capsules in the United States. An open-label extension phase is planned following the nine-month study, which could enable patients who completed the randomized phase to commence or continue receiving octreotide capsules and for us to collect long-term safety information. The results of the extension phase are not required as the basis for an efficacy claim. 
 In March 2016, we initiated an additional international Phase 3 clinical trial of octreotide capsules in acromegaly in support of potential approval in the European Union. The trial, referred to as MPOWERED (Maintenance of Acromegaly Patients with Octreotide Capsules Compared With Injections -Evaluation of REsponse Durability), is designed to show parallel comparative safety and effectiveness as required by the EMA. In late 2016, following the FDAs position that the MPOWERED clinical trial would not be sufficient to address the concerns raised in the CRL, we modified certain elements of the MPOWERED trial in an effort to preserve patients, sites and other resources necessary to conduct the CHIASMA OPTIMAL Phase 3 trial, which was designed to address the FDAs concerns, and produce data packages suitable for submission in both the United States and the European Union. We expect to complete enrollment in MPOWERED in the second quarter of 2019 and to release top-line data from the MPOWERED trial in the second half of 2020. Assuming positive data from MPOWERED, and subject to the successful outcome of our planned NDA, we expect to submit a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, to the EMA. 
 Acromegaly is a condition caused by a benign tumor of the pituitary gland that releases excess GH, which in turn elevates IGF-1. These elevated hormone levels result in a number of painful and disfiguring symptoms, including some acute, such as headaches, joint pain and fatigue, and some long-term, such as enlarged hands, feet and 
 
3 


  internal organs, as well as altered facial features. If not treated promptly, acromegaly can lead to serious illness and is associated with premature death, primarily due to cardiovascular disease. According to data published by the Mayo Clinic in 2013, the mortality rate of people afflicted by acromegaly who go untreated is two to three times higher than that of the general population. 
 The current standard of care for patients diagnosed with acromegaly and not otherwise cured by surgical removal of the pituitary tumor consists of lifelong, once-monthly injections of an extended release somatostatin analog, primarily octreotide or lanreotide. These products contain a viscous formulation and are typically administered by a healthcare professional with large-gauge needles into the muscle or deep subcutaneously, that is, deeply under the skin. While injectable somatostatin analogs are generally effective at reducing GH and IGF-1 levels and therefore providing disease control, the injections are associated with significant limitations and patient burdens, including suboptimal symptom control, pain, injection-site reactions and other injection-related side effects, inconvenience, lost work days and emotional issues. We believe that approximately 8,000 adult acromegaly patients are chronically treated with somatostatin analogs in the United States, and that approximately 90% of these patients are managed by fewer than 1,000 patient care centers. Patients with acromegaly undergoing treatment in the United States are generally treated by endocrinologists at a small number of academic institutions with pituitary experts (pituitary centers), regional academic centers or hospital systems (regional referral centers) and some community endocrinologists. 
 We retain worldwide rights to develop and commercialize octreotide capsules with no royalty obligations to third parties. If approved, we may commercialize octreotide capsules ourselves in the United States and we plan to explore the strategic merits of collaboration opportunities for commercializing octreotide capsules in the European Union and the rest of the world. Octreotide capsules are currently protected by issued patents lasting until at least 2029 in the United States, the European Union, United Kingdom, Japan and several other jurisdictions, and by pending patent applications in additional jurisdictions that will last until 2029, if granted. We are also pursuing additional patent applications relating to particular uses, dosages and packaging for octreotide capsules. On March 26, 2019, a United States patent which is directed to specific methods of using octreotide capsules is due to be granted. This patent, once granted, will expire in 2036. 
 Strategy 
 Our goal is to become a successful patient-focused biopharmaceutical company by developing and commercializing, ourselves or through others, octreotide capsules for acromegaly. Our strategy to pursue this goal includes the following elements: 

 | Obtain U.S. regulatory approval of octreotide capsules for the treatment of acromegaly. We designed the CHIASMA OPTIMAL trial to address the concerns contained in the CRL and have secured agreement on the protocol and statistical analysis plan with the FDA under SPA procedures. We expect to release top-line data from this trial in the third quarter of 2019, and assuming favorable results, we expect to resubmit our NDA to the FDA by the end of 2019 to potentially secure regulatory approval in the United States for MYCAPPSA in mid-2020.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Obtain European Union regulatory approval of octreotide capsules for the treatment of acromegaly. To support approval in the European Union, we initiated the Phase 3 MPOWERED clinical trial in March 2016, with a protocol that has been accepted by the EMA, to evaluate the comparative safety and efficacy of octreotide capsules in adult acromegaly patients. We currently expect to release top-line data from this trial in the second half of 2020, and assuming favorable results, and pending the successful outcome of our planned NDA, we expect to submit our MAA to the EMA to potentially secure approval in the European Union for MYCAPSSA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Explore collaboration opportunities in the European Union and the rest of the world for octreotide capsules in acromegaly. At the appropriate time, we intend to explore one or more collaborations to commercialize octreotide capsules in acromegaly outside of the United States. However, depending on

our evaluation of the strategic merits of these collaboration opportunities, we may decide to retain commercial rights in key markets and undertake commercialization preparation and activities ourselves, if required regulatory approvals are obtained.

Our Product Candidate, Octreotide Capsules (MYCAPSSA) in Acromegaly 
 Product Candidate Overview 
 Octreotide capsules are a novel oral formulation of octreotide developed utilizing our TPE platform. We are developing octreotide capsules as a liquid-filled solid gelatin capsule formulation which is intended to be taken twice a day. We expect that acromegaly patients who are prescribed octreotide capsules, if approved, will receive a 28-day supply of capsules, which may be stored at room temperature by the patient for up to one month. Based on the aggregate data from our previously completed clinical trials and the ongoing randomization rate of responders following the six-month run-in phase of our Phase 3 MPOWERED clinical trial, we believe octreotide capsules have the potential to induce biochemical response (inhibition of GH and IGF-1) while improving symptoms and reducing the burden of disease and treatment in patients afflicted with acromegaly. 
 Our product candidate, octreotide capsules, has completed one Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of acromegaly and 11 pharmacology and pharmacokinetic (PK) Phase 1 studies. In August 2015, our NDA for octreotide capsules as a maintenance therapy for acromegaly in the United States was accepted by the FDA for filing. In April 2016, the FDA issued a CRL to our NDA. In the CRL, the FDA advised us that it did not believe our NDA had provided substantial evidence of efficacy to warrant approval and advised us that we would need to conduct another clinical trial in order to overcome this deficiency. The FDA expressed concerns regarding certain aspects of our single-arm, open-label Phase 3 clinical trial and strongly recommended that we conduct a randomized, double-blind and controlled trial that enrolls patients from the United States and be of sufficiently long duration to ensure that control of disease activity is stable at the time point selected for the primary efficacy assessment. In addition, the FDA advised that, during a site inspection, certain deficiencies were conveyed to the representative of one of our suppliers that would need to be resolved before approval. In June 2016, we participated in an End of Review meeting with the FDA where the FDA reiterated its concerns raised in the CRL. In the minutes from the End of Review Meeting, the FDA indicated that some of its concerns could potentially be addressed through a placebo-controlled study design. In December 2016, we were informed that the supplier referred to in the CRL had recently received its Establishment Inspection Report, or EIR, from the FDA. The receipt of the EIR is an indication that the FDA has concluded its inspection of the supplier and as of the date of its report considers outstanding deficiencies resolved. In September 2017, we initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial for oral octreotide capsules for the maintenance therapy of adult patients with acromegaly following our agreement with the FDA on the design of the trial, reached through a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, in August 2017. The trial, referred to as CHIASMA OPTIMAL, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, nine-month trial expected to enroll 50 adult acromegaly patients designed to address the concerns raised in the CRL and support regulatory approval of octreotide capsules in the United States. In October 2018, we completed enrollment in this trial with 56 acromegaly patients in 17 countries, including 21 from the United States, which exceeded our original SPA-agreed enrollment goal of 50 patients. 
 The EMA has advised us that a clinical trial demonstrating non-inferiority of octreotide capsules compared to injectable somatostatin analogs as active controls will be required prior to regulatory approval in the European Union. We agreed on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol with the EMA and, in March 2016, we initiated an international Phase 3 clinical trial, referred to as MPOWERED, of oral octreotide capsules for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with acromegaly to support regulatory approval in the European Union. Following the FDAs position that the MPOWERED clinical trial will not be sufficient to address the concerns in the CRL, we modified certain elements of the MPOWERED trial in an effort to preserve patients, sites and other resources necessary to conduct the Phase 3 CHIASMA OPTIMAL trial addressing the FDAs concerns and produce data packages that could be suitable for submission in both the United States and the European Union. The EMA requested that a minimum of at least 80 patients who are responders to octreotide capsules following the

  six-month run-in phase be randomized to either remain on octreotide capsules or return to injectable somatostatin receptor ligands (octreotide or lanreotide), and then followed for an additional nine months. In October 2018, 80 patients were randomized following the six-month run-in phase in the MPOWERED trial. Further, in October 2018, we elected to resume enrollment in the trial in an effort to enroll up to 15 additional patients exclusively located in the United States in order to gain further U.S. investigator and patient experience with octreotide capsules. 
 Overview of Acromegaly 
 Acromegaly results from the overproduction of GH, most often due to the growth of a benign tumor in the pituitary gland in middle-aged adults. GH, in turn, stimulates the production of IGF-1 in the liver which stimulates the growth of bones and other tissues. Progression of acromegaly can result in significant health problems such as hypertension, enlargement of the heart, or cardiomyopathy, sleep apnea, type-2 diabetes, and abnormal growths in the colon and uterus. Acromegaly is associated with a number of symptoms, some acute, such as headaches, joint pain and fatigue, and some long-term, such as enlarged hands, feet and internal organs, as well as altered facial features. Because acromegaly is uncommon and physical changes occur gradually, the condition is often not recognized immediately, sometimes not for years. If not treated promptly, acromegaly can lead to serious illness and is associated with premature death, primarily due to cardiovascular disease. However, both surgical and drug treatments are available for acromegaly that can reduce the risk of complications and premature death and significantly improve symptom control. 
 Surgery is often the first line of therapy for acromegaly and, in most cases, surgical removal of the pituitary tumor can result in normalization of GH and IGF-1 levels. In many other cases, however, the levels of GH remain elevated even after surgery due to residual tumor and many patients therefore also require a therapeutic intervention. The bodys natural inhibitor of excess GH secretion is somatostatin, a peptide hormone. Octreotide and lanreotide, analogs of somatostatin with a significantly longer half-life in the blood than natural somatostatin, have achieved widespread adoption by physicians treating patients afflicted with acromegaly. These somatostatin analogs are routinely administered by injection by a healthcare professional. If not administered with proper technique, the injection may not effectively deliver the medication. There is currently no oral formulation of a somatostatin analog on the market and none, we believe, in clinical development except our octreotide capsules product candidate. 
Incidence and Prevalence of Acromegaly and Current Treatment Landscape 
 There are an estimated 69,000 individuals with acromegaly worldwide. The U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH, estimates that there are roughly 20,000 individuals with acromegaly in the United States, based on its published prevalence of an estimated 60 cases per million. In 13 studies of acromegaly prevalence since 1980, an average of approximately 75 cases per million was determined, suggesting roughly 24,000 individuals with acromegaly in the United States. However, data presented at the Endocrine Societys Annual Meeting in 2015 suggest that pituitary tumors may be more prevalent than previously thought, and that the global prevalence of acromegaly may be higher, between 85 and 118 cases per million people. NIH also cites an annual incidence of three to four new cases per million each year. Data from a 2017 study by Lavrentaki et. al. suggest that the global prevalence of acromegaly may be between 28 and 137 cases per million people. 
 According to publicly available financial reports, injectable forms of octreotide and lanreotide generate worldwide sales of approximately $2.7 billion annually for the treatment of acromegaly, neuroendocrine tumors and some other smaller indications. We believe approximately $810 million of this total represents the annual sales for the treatment of acromegaly. The great majority of these sales come from once-monthly long acting formulations that must be administered by intramuscular or deep subcutaneous injections with large-gauge needles. Although we are targeting acromegaly with octreotide capsules, we believe that this product candidate, if approved in acromegaly, has the potential to become a standard of care in other indications currently treated with injectable somatostatin analogs.

 Current Therapeutic Options and Their Limitations 
 For acromegaly patients not cured by surgery, the current standard of care involves injectable somatostatin analogs. These therapies are associated with significant patient limitations and burdens. Currently, the first therapeutic treatment options are octreotide LAR, marketed by Novartis AG, or Novartis, which is administered monthly and intramuscularly using a large gauge needle, and lanreotide depot, another long-acting analog of somatostatin marketed by Ipsen SA, or Ipsen, which is administered monthly using a deep subcutaneous injection. Immediate release octreotide, while available, is more rarely used. For patients not controlled on these somatostatin analogs, the typical second line of treatment options (which may also be acceptably used as first line therapy) includes pegvisomant daily injections, marketed by Pfizer, Inc., or Pfizer, and pasireotide LAR, which is another somatostatin analog marketed by Novartis, which is administered monthly via intramuscular injection. 

Current Injectable Treatment Options for Acromegaly
Product | Company | Route | Needle (length/gauge) | Status 
Octreotide LAR | Novartis | Intramuscular | 1.5/19 or 20 G | Marketed
Lanreotide Depot | Ipsen | Deep Subcutaneous | 0.79/18 or 19 G | Marketed
Pasireotide LAR | Novartis | Intramuscular | 1.5/20 G | Marketed
Pegvisomant | Pfizer | Subcutaneous | 1/21-27 G | Marketed

 Injections of these somatostatin analogs present several issues related to patient comfort and convenience as well as breakthrough, or returning, symptoms of the disease near the end of the dosing cycle prior to the next scheduled injection. These issues include: 
 

 | Suboptimal control. In a published patient-reported outcomes survey that we conducted in 195 acromegaly patients receiving injected somatostatin analogs, or our patient survey, 52% of patients reported that the treatment effects begin to wane near the end of the monthly cycle prior to the next injection, and 32% of controlled patients still experienced some symptoms.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Pain. Injections with somatostatin analogs require a large-gauge needle to slowly inject a viscous solution into the muscle or deep into subcutaneous tissue. Patients report these injections to be very painful. Often, this pain persists for several days after the injection. In our patient survey, 70% of patients said they experienced pain during the injection and approximately half of these patients experienced continuing pain days later.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Injection-site reactions. Patients frequently experience hardness, nodules and swelling at the site of the injection as well as bruising and inflammation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Lack of convenience. The treatment effectiveness is dependent on proper delivery technique and thus the injections are typically administered by a healthcare professional. The monthly injection schedule for injectable somatostatin analogs and the associated travel to the healthcare provider is inconvenient for many patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Emotional impact. In our patient survey, 36% of patients said that they felt a loss of independence due to the requirement for chronic injections that typically require them to visit a healthcare professional.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Lost work days. In our patient survey, 16% of patients said that the treatment burden associated with the injectable therapies caused them to regularly miss work for injections. These patients missed an average of 11 days a year.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Utilizing the Acromegaly Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, or Acro-TSQ, a patient-reported symptom assessment tool developed and copyrighted by us, screening data from 70 eligible patients in the MPOWERED trial who treated their acromegaly with octreotide LAR or lanreotide depot were collected and analyzed in 2018. The findings include: 

 | Ongoing symptoms. 66% of patients reported ongoing acromegaly symptoms, of which 83% reported some symptoms all the time.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
7 


 
 | Worsening symptoms. 50% indicated some symptoms worsen towards the end of the monthly injection interval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Interference with life. Symptoms interfered with daily life (91%) and leisure activities (86%).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | GI side effects. More than 50% reported gastrointestinal, or GI, side effects (median duration five days following each injection) that interfered with daily life.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Worsening GI effects. GI side effects were worse in patients with more active symptoms but did not correlate with IGF-1 levels or treatment dose.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since injectable somatostatin analogs are used in other diseases beyond acromegaly, these limitations and burdens are also associated with the treatment of the other indications. If approved in acromegaly, we believe oral octreotide capsules have the potential to become a standard of care in these other indications. 
 Clinical Program for Octreotide Capsules in Acromegaly 
 United States Regulatory Pathway 
 We previously sought regulatory approval of octreotide capsules for the maintenance therapy of acromegaly in the United States utilizing the FDAs 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. The 505(b)(2) pathway enables us to rely, in part, on the FDAs prior findings of safety and efficacy of an approved product, or published literature, in support of an NDA. In the case of octreotide capsules in acromegaly, the approved product to which our prior NDA submission referred is the short-acting subcutaneous injectable formulation of octreotide that was the original product approved by the FDA before the long-acting formulation was developed. Since this formulation of octreotide was approved by the FDA in generic form and is therefore no longer proprietary, we are not aware of any third party from which we would be required to obtain any license or acquire any rights to commercialize octreotide capsules, if approved. As described in more detail below, we have completed a series of Phase 1 clinical trials, including a trial to demonstrate that the systemic octreotide exposure from octreotide capsules, developed utilizing our TPE technology, is comparable to that of octreotide administered in the short-acting subcutaneous injectable formulation. We have also completed a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the bioactivity of octreotide capsules in healthy subjects, and a Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of octreotide capsules in patients with acromegaly, consisting of seven months of treatment plus an optional six-month extension phase. 
 In December 2014, we met with the FDA to discuss our clinical development of octreotide capsules, including the full 13-month data from our first Phase 3 clinical trial. At this meeting, the FDA advised us that it had not identified an issue that would preclude us from submitting an NDA for review. However, the FDA did advise us that interpreting efficacy from a voluntary long-term extension study is subject to limitations and therefore the data at the seven-month time point in our Phase 3 clinical trial would carry more weight in the efficacy evaluation than the extension data. The FDA also informed us that, in its view, a single-arm study was not as informative as a controlled study, such as an active control trial using a non-inferiority design, and that the interpretability of the efficacy findings we submitted from our single-arm study, and whether these findings are robust enough to warrant approval, would be review issues as the FDA evaluated our NDA. In August 2015, our NDA for octreotide capsules for maintenance therapy in acromegaly was accepted for filing by the FDA. 
 In April 2016, the FDA issued a CRL to our NDA. In the CRL, the FDA advised us that it did not believe our NDA had provided substantial evidence of efficacy to warrant approval and advised us that we would need to conduct another clinical trial in order to overcome this deficiency. The FDA expressed concerns regarding certain aspects of our single-arm, open-label Phase 3 clinical trial and strongly recommended that we conduct a randomized, double-blind and controlled trial that enrolls patients from the United States and be of sufficiently long duration to ensure that control of disease activity is stable at the time point selected for the primary efficacy assessment. In addition, the FDA advised that, during a site inspection, certain deficiencies were conveyed to the representative of one of our suppliers that would need to be resolved before approval. In December 2016, we

  were informed that the supplier had recently received its Establishment Inspection Report, or EIR, from the FDA. The receipt of the EIR is an indication that the FDA has concluded its inspection of the supplier and as of the date of its report considers outstanding deficiencies resolved. In June 2016, we participated in an End of Review meeting with the FDA where the FDA reiterated its concerns raised in the CRL. In the minutes from the End of Review Meeting, the FDA indicated that some of its concerns could potentially be addressed through a placebo-controlled study design. 
 Special Protocol Assessment and CHIASMA OPTIMAL Phase 3 Clinical Trial 
 In August 2017, we reached agreement with the FDA under a SPA of a new Phase 3 clinical trial of octreotide capsules in adult acromegaly patients, designed to address the concerns previously raised in the CRL and support a potential resubmission of our NDA for octreotide capsules in acromegaly. The CHIASMA OPTIMAL trial, which we initiated in September 2017, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, nine-month clinical trial in 50 adult acromegaly patients (at least 20% of whom must be recruited from the United States) whose disease is biochemically controlled, based upon levels of insulin-like growth factor, IGF-1, a byproduct of increased GH levels caused by acromegaly, on injectable somatostatin analogs at baseline (average IGF-1 £ 1.0 x ULN). The patients must also have confirmed active acromegaly following their last surgical intervention based upon an elevated IGF-1 at that time of ³ 1.3 x ULN. The patients in the trial were randomized on a 1:1 basis to octreotide capsules or placebo. Patients will be dose titrated from 40 mg per day to up to a maximum of 80 mg per day, equaling two capsules in the morning and two capsules in the evening. Similar to the requirements of our first completed Phase 3 clinical trial and the MPOWERED trial, patients will be required to take octreotide capsules at least one hour prior to a meal or two hours after a meal. Patients who meet predefined withdrawal criteria or withdraw from oral treatment in either treatment arm for any reason during the course of the trial will be considered treatment failures; those patients will be offered their original treatment of injections and monitored for the remainder of the trial. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients who maintain their biochemical response compared to placebo at the end of the nine-month double-blind, placebo-controlled period as measured using the average of the last two IGF-1 levels £ 1.0 x ULN. In May 2018, we reached further agreement with the FDA under a SPA Agreement Modification letter providing that the hierarchical secondary endpoints that will be considered by the FDA in evaluating the totality of evidence for octreotide capsules treatment effect now are: 

 | Proportion of patients who maintain GH response at week 36 compared to screening;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Time to loss of response: IGF-1 > 1.0×ULN;
--+-------------------------------------------


 | Time to loss of response: IGF-1 > 1.3×ULN; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


 | Proportion of patients requiring rescue treatment.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 An open-label extension phase is planned following the nine-month study, which could enable patients who completed the randomized phase to commence or continue receiving octreotide capsules and for us to collect long-term safety information. The results of the extension phase are not required as the basis for an efficacy claim.

 CHIASMA OPTIMAL Phase 3 Clinical Trial Design 
 

We initiated the CHIASMA OPTIMAL trial in September 2017 and activated more than 50 clinical sites dedicated to CHIASMA OPTIMAL. In October 2018, we completed enrollment in this trial with 56 acromegaly patients. We expect to release top-line data from this trial in the third quarter of 2019. If the data from CHIASMA OPTIMAL is positive, we plan to resubmit our NDA by year-end 2019. We expect the FDA will aim to complete its review of our anticipated NDA, if accepted for filing, within six months based on our expectation that the NDA will be designated a Class 2 resubmission by FDA to address its April 2016 complete response letter, or CRL, to our original NDA. 
 We anticipate that the FDA will review the totality of the data collected from the CHIASMA OPTIMAL trial, including both primary and secondary endpoints, together with the data from our other clinical trials of octreotide capsules, and whether the data collected are sufficiently robust to support the interpretability of these analyses, in determining whether to approve any NDA we may submit for octreotide capsules. There can be no assurance that the data collected from the CHIASMA OPTIMAL trial will be sufficient to support approval of any NDA we may submit to allow us to commercialize octreotide capsules in the United States. 
 European Regulatory Pathway 
 We also intend to seek regulatory approval of octreotide capsules for the treatment of acromegaly in the European Union utilizing the hybrid application pathway, which is analogous to the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway in the United States. In addition to the clinical data we previously submitted to the FDA in 2015, the EMA has advised us that a clinical trial demonstrating non-inferiority of octreotide capsules compared to injectable somatostatin analogs as active controls will be required prior to regulatory approval by EMA. We also anticipate that the EMA will expect to review the safety and efficacy data from the CHIASMA OPTIMAL trial in any MAA we may file. Our MPOWERED Phase 3 clinical trial protocol has been accepted by the EMA and we initiated this trial in March 2016. 
MPOWERED Phase 3 Clinical Trial 
 Comparative effectiveness is an important regulatory consideration in the European Union. After agreeing to the clinical trial protocol with the EMA, we initiated an international Phase 3 clinical trial of octreotide capsules in acromegaly in March 2016 to show parallel comparative safety and effectiveness. 
 This trial is called MPOWERED, Maintenance of Acromegaly Patients with Octreotide Capsules Compared With Injections -Evaluation of REsponse Durability. This trial is an open-label, randomized, active-controlled study of octreotide capsules in patients who have been classified in the study as responders to a once-a-month

10 


  injectable somatostatin analog based on criteria comparable to the criteria utilized in our completed Phase 3 clinical trial. This trial is intended to demonstrate non-inferiority, comparing efficacy responses as between two randomized groups of patients who demonstrated response to octreotide capsules. In July 2018, we completed the enrollment of 135 adult acromegaly patients into the run-in phase of the MPOWERED trial. The EMA requested that a minimum of at least 80 patients who are responders to octreotide capsules following the six-month run-in phase be randomized to either remain on octreotide capsules or return to injectable somatostatin receptor ligands (octreotide or lanreotide), and then followed for an additional nine months. In October 2018, 80 patients were randomized following the six-month run-in phase in the MPOWERED trial. Further, in October 2018, we elected to resume enrollment in the trial in an effort to enroll up to 15 additional patients exclusively located in the United States in order to gain further U.S. investigator and patient experience with octreotide capsules. As such, we now expect to enroll up to 150 total patients in the trial in the United States, Europe, Russia and other foreign countries. Each patient will initially receive a daily dose of 40 mg of octreotide capsules, which will be increased up to a maximum of 80 mg daily dose if lower doses are not effective. Similar to the requirements of our first completed Phase 3 clinical trial and the CHIASMA OPTIMAL trial, patients will be required to take octreotide capsules at least one hour prior to a meal or two hours after a meal. 
 The primary efficacy endpoint for this trial is the proportion of patients who are biochemically controlled throughout the nine-month randomized-controlled phase measuring IGF-1 with responders defined as patients who achieve an IGF-1 level less than 1.3 times the ULN adjusted for age, the same IGF-1 efficacy criteria utilized in our first, completed Phase 3 clinical trial. Measurements of IGF-1 will be taken throughout the randomized phase of the trial and a time weighted average of these biochemical measures will be calculated. In addition, assessment of symptom control and patient reported outcomes are expected to be reported. 
 In October 2018, 80 patients identified as responders to octreotide capsules (IGF-1 <1.3 x ULN and GH<2.5 ng/mL) following the six-month run-in phase had been randomized (2:3) to either go back to their original long-acting injectable somatostatin analog or remain on octreotide capsules at the appropriate dose identified during the run-in phase and then followed for an additional nine months. After completing the randomized controlled phase, patients will be offered the opportunity to participate in a withdrawal phase sub-study to assess evidence of active disease and the requirement for long term treatment. We expect that all eligible patients will have the option of entering an extension phase during which period these patients would receive octreotide capsules at the dose identified during the run-in phase. 
 Patients who do not respond during the run-in phase will not enter the randomized phase but will be switched back to long-acting injectable somatostatin analog and followed for an additional three months or, in selected centers, may be offered the opportunity to determine if they can respond to a combination of octreotide capsules with a second oral agent called cabergoline. Cabergoline is used for the treatment of mild acromegaly. It has a different mechanism of action and publications have suggested it may have an additive effect to somatostatin analogs. This sub-study, which the EMA did not accept as part of the final protocol for comparative effectiveness, is unlikely to be sufficient to gain regulatory approval for the combination of both drugs but may provide useful information to physicians.

 MPOWERED Phase 3 Design to Support EMA Application 
 

In late 2016, the FDA advised us that the MPOWERED clinical trial will not be sufficient to address the concerns identified by the FDA in the CRL. Consequently, we modified certain elements of the MPOWERED study in an effort to preserve patients, sites and other resources necessary to conduct the Phase 3 CHIASMA OPTIMAL trial, which was designed to address the FDAs concerns, and produce data packages that could be suitable for submission in both the United States and the European Union. We expect to complete enrollment in MPOWERED in the second quarter of 2019 and to release top-line data from the MPOWERED trial in the second half of 2020. 
 Completed Phase 3 Clinical Trial 
 In March 2012, we initiated a Phase 3 multi-center, open-label, baseline-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of octreotide capsules in patients with acromegaly who responded to and tolerated treatment with somatostatin analogs. We completed this trial in November 2014 and the results were published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism in February 2015 and presented at the Endocrine Societys Annual Meeting in March 2015. To date, octreotide capsules is the first and only somatostatin analog formulated for oral administration to complete a Phase 3 clinical trial. In addition, the results were submitted with our NDA for octreotide capsules in June 2015. In the CRL to our NDA, the FDA expressed concerns regarding certain aspects of the companys single-arm, open-label Phase 3 clinical trial and strongly recommended that we conduct a randomized, double-blind and controlled trial that enrolls patients from the United States and is of sufficiently long duration to ensure that control of disease activity is stable at the time point selected for the primary efficacy assessment. In the minutes from our End of Review Meeting, the FDA indicated that some of its concerns could potentially be addressed through a placebo-controlled study design, which we have sought to address with CHIASMA OPTIMAL. 
Trial Design 
 A total of 155 patients with acromegaly, each of whom was classified according to the study parameters as a responder to a long-acting injectable somatostatin analog, were enrolled in the trial. Two weeks after their last monthly injection of the long-acting injectable somatostatin analog, patients were reassessed to obtain baseline IGF-1 and GH levels. Both the screening and baseline measurements were performed while patients were still on active injection therapy. The 155 patients enrolled in the trial are referred to as the intent to treat, or ITT, group. 
 After baseline levels were obtained, no less than one month following their last monthly injection of the long-acting injectable somatostatin analog, a core treatment period with octreotide capsules was initiated. This core 
 
12 


  treatment period consisted of a dose-escalation phase of at least two months in duration, designed to find an appropriate dose of octreotide capsules for each individual patient, and a fixed-dose phase of up to five months in duration, during which period the appropriate therapeutic dose identified in the dose-escalation phase was maintained. Since data from the prior clinical trials we conducted before this initial Phase 3 trial demonstrated a significant reduction in bioavailability when octreotide capsules were administered with a high-fat meal, patients in this Phase 3 clinical trial were required to fast for at least one hour before and at least one to two hours after each dose. 
 Patients who entered the core treatment phase of the trial initially received a 40 mg daily dose (administered in two pills a day), which was increased to daily doses of 60 mg or 80 mg on an as-required basis to maintain biochemical response and/or symptom control, at the discretion of the investigator. For each patient, the core treatment phase lasted for seven months after his or her first dose of octreotide capsules. Patients could then opt to continue treatment with octreotide capsules during an extension period of up to an additional six months, with a two-week period for final follow-up. Four patients dropped out of the trial after receiving at least one dose of octreotide capsules but before a biochemical response could be measured, resulting in a modified intent to treat, or mITT, group of 151 patients. 
 The primary objective of the trial was to determine the efficacy of octreotide capsules in patients with acromegaly, as measured by effect on IGF-1 and GH levels, with responders defined as patients who achieve an IGF-1 level less than 1.3 times the ULN, adjusted for age and an integrated GH level over two hours less than 2.5 ng/mL. Secondary objectives included assessment of safety and tolerability of octreotide capsules, and comparison of efficacy of octreotide capsules versus long-acting injectable somatostatin analog. 
 Completed Phase 3 Clinical Trial Design 
 

Trial Results 
 Of the 155 patients enrolled, four were not evaluable and of the 151 in the mITT group, 49 patients discontinued, the majority during the dose-escalation phase. Of the 151 patients in the mITT group, patients discontinued for a variety of reasons, including treatment failures because the patient could not be controlled in the study on 80 mg, the highest dose available (24); withdrawals due to adverse events (18); or patient choice, sponsor request and lost to follow up (7). Of the 110 patients who completed the dose-escalation phase, 52 patients, or 47%, were receiving the 40 mg daily dose, 25 patients, or 23%, were receiving the 60 mg dose, and 33 patients, or 30%, were receiving the 80 mg dose.

 After completion of the dose-escalation phase, the remaining 110 patients entered the fixed dose phase of the core treatment period and continued on octreotide capsules at their respective doses until seven months after first dosing. A total of 102 patients completed the fixed dose phase of the trial, 88 of whom, or 86%, voluntarily chose to remain on octreotide capsules during the six-month extension phase, for a total of 13 months of treatment after first dosing. A total of 82 patients completed the six-month extension phase of the trial. 
 Applying a last-observation carried forward, or LOCF, methodology, 65% of patients in the mITT group were classified as responders at the end of the seven-month core treatment phase, which was the primary endpoint for the trial. Applying a worst-case imputation method, whereby all patients who withdrew from the study prematurely (regardless of reason) are treated as non-responders, 53% of patients were classified as responders at the end of the seven-month core treatment phase. By the end of the six-month extension phase, or 13 months after first dosing, utilizing LOCF the responder rate was 62% in the mITT group. Of the 110 patients who completed the dose-escalation phase, and therefore received an optimized dose of octreotide capsules, 75% were classified as responders. For all 151 patients included in the mITT group, the responder rate on long-acting injectable somatostatin analogs was 89% at baseline, prior to initiation of octreotide capsules. Endocrinologists indicated to us that effectiveness in at least 50% of patients treated would be sufficient for an oral treatment to generally be prescribed by physicians. 
 Overall Phase 3 Response in mITT Group vs. Baseline 
 

We further assessed the quality of the responses to octreotide capsules in the patients studied. The quality of the patient responses on octreotide capsules was comparable to the quality of the responses on injectable therapies. In the mITT group, mean GH levels for patients on octreotide capsules were below the baseline values on injectable therapies at all time points assessed through the end of the extension phase. The median GH level in the mITT group at baseline was 0.77 ng/mL, which dropped to 0.40 ng/mL within two hours of the first dose of octreotide capsules and 0.49 ng/mL by the end of the extension phase, 13 months later. IGF-1 levels were stably maintained below 1.3 times the ULN for up to 13 months in the mITT group.

 GH and IGF-1 Response in mITT Group Throughout the Duration of the Phase 3 Trial 
 

We also assessed control of acromegaly symptoms, the incidence of symptoms, and the severity and number of symptoms in patients using octreotide capsules in a retrospective analysis performed after completion of the trial. At baseline, 81% of patients in the mITT group, the majority of whom were classified as responders, still had acromegaly symptoms, such as headaches, excessive perspiration, muscle weakness and/or joint pain and swelling. Patients who completed 13 months of treatment reported significantly fewer acromegaly symptoms at the conclusion of the trial than at the time of their baseline screening, and this result was statistically significant, with p-values of less than 0.020. P-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of clinical results. A p-value of 0.05 or less is generally considered to represent statistical significance, meaning that there is a less than 1-in-20 likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance. There was also a reduction in the severity of symptoms reported. In addition, a questionnaire conducted in a subset of the patients in the clinical trial reported that breakthrough symptoms of acromegaly were experienced by 36% of patients receiving injections at baseline compared to 22% at 13 months on octreotide capsules.

The safety profile of octreotide capsules in the trial was consistent with the known safety profile of octreotide and the disease burden of acromegaly, with the most common adverse events observed in the gastrointestinal system, such as nausea and diarrhea, the nervous system, such as headaches, and the musculoskeletal system, such as joint pain, but without adverse injection-site reactions. No new or unexpected safety signals were observed in the study. While the FDA did not note any safety concerns related to octreotide capsules in the CRL, it subsequently indicated in the End of Review meeting minutes that the size, duration, dropout rate and absence of a control group in our Phase 3 clinical trial were factors limiting an overall safety assessment. 
 We only performed statistical analysis on the symptom reductions for our Phase 3 trial of octreotide capsules in acromegaly and did not perform statistical analysis related to the biochemistry, specifically the reduction in GH and IGF-1 levels. 
 Completed Phase 1 Clinical Trials of Octreotide Capsules 
 Together with a group of academic collaborators, we conducted a series of Phase 1 clinical trials to demonstrate that the bioavailability of octreotide capsules, developed utilizing our TPE technology, is comparable to the bioavailability of octreotide administered in the short-acting subcutaneous, or sc, formulation. These trials demonstrated similar pharmacokinetics for octreotide capsules and octreotide 0.1 mg sc injection and that a 20 mg oral dose of octreotide capsules produced systemic exposure comparable to octreotide 0.1 mg sc injection in healthy volunteers. There was no effect of route of administration on octreotide elimination, and the mean elimination half-life (t1/2) was comparable with the two treatments. However, these studies also demonstrated that the bioavailability of octreotide capsules is approximately 90% lower when it is taken with a high-fat meal rather than in the fasted state. Accordingly, our current Phase 3 clinical trials require patients to take octreotide capsules at least one hour prior to a meal or two hours after a meal.

 Pharmacokinetics of Octreotide capsules vs. SC Octreotide in Phase 1 Trial 
 

In addition, to demonstrate the bioactivity of octreotide capsules, as measured by reduction in GH levels, we conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial in 16 healthy volunteers. In this crossover study, a single 20 mg dose of octreotide capsules was shown to suppress mean GH levels below 0.25 ng/mL (p < 0.05). This is similar to the effect seen in published results using octreotide injections. 
 Suppression of GH Levels in Healthy Volunteers 
 

Also in this trial, we evaluated the ability of octreotide capsules to suppress GH levels in healthy subjects whose production of GH had been transiently stimulated by dosing with growth hormone-releasing hormone, or GHRH, and arginine. GHRH and arginine are used in routine clinical testing for deficiencies in GH production. In a healthy person, their administration leads to a large increase in GH levels, which is what was observed in this trial. A single 20 mg dose of octreotide capsules lowered the levels of GH by 80% (p < 0.001) following dosing with GHRH and arginine. 
 Data from our Phase 1 bioavailability and bioactivity clinical trials were published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism in July 2012. 
 A total of 11 clinical pharmacology studies have evaluated the safety of octreotide capsules. In all of these studies, the safety profile of octreotide capsules was consistent with the known safety profile of the short-acting octreotide 0.1 mg sc injection. No new or unexpected safety issues were detected during any of the clinical 
 
17 


  pharmacology studies. In particular, no new safety issues related to the novel formulation or route of administration were observed. While the FDA did not note any safety concerns related to octreotide capsules in the CRL, it subsequently indicated in the End of Review meeting minutes that the size, duration, dropout rate and absence of a control group in our Phase 3 clinical trial were factors limiting an overall safety assessment. 
 Other Potential Indications for Octreotide Capsules 
 If we receive regulatory approval for octreotide capsules in acromegaly, we may pursue the development of octreotide capsules in other indications. At this time, we do not currently have the personnel or financing to simultaneously pursue the development of octreotide capsules in indications other than acromegaly. 
Our Proprietary Transient Permeability Enhancer Technology Platform 
 Our Transient Permeability Enhancer, or TPE, technology is a proprietary platform, developed internally by our scientists, that enhances the absorption through the intestinal wall of drugs that otherwise would not be absorbed efficiently by that route. Using our TPE technology, we can transiently and reversibly open the so-called tight junctions between the cells lining the inner intestinal wall, enabling drug molecules to be absorbed intact. Our TPE formulation is a suspension of water-soluble particles containing a precise combination of medium-chain fatty acid salts and drug substance in a fat-soluble medium. In creating a TPE formulation, we make no chemical modifications to the drug substance. 
 Oral delivery of peptides and nucleic acids is limited due to their inherent vulnerability to digestive processes and their poor intestinal absorption. The same intestinal absorption limitation applies to certain small molecules that have poor bioavailability. The cells at the surface of the intestine, columnar epithelial cells, are connected by tight junctions that form a barrier preventing permeation by water-soluble molecules as well as by viruses and bacteria. Our TPE technology induces the transient opening of these tight junctions, allowing peptides and other macromolecules up to a certain size, but not toxins, viruses and bacteria, to cross the intestinal barrier and enabling access to the blood. 
 The permeability of intestinal tight junctions is known to be altered by a number of dietary factors such as fatty acids, polysaccharides and flavonoids. Transient, reversible opening of the tight junctions and an increase in epithelial permeability are a normal part of intestinal physiology. These permeability adjustments allow the gut to balance two opposing functions: creating a barrier to the passage of microorganisms while facilitating the absorption of nutrients following a meal. In developing the TPE platform, our goal was to establish the ability to reproducibly induce transient increases in the permeability of tight junctions, allowing absorption of specifically formulated drug molecules. 
 We have conducted extensive nonclinical studies to demonstrate the ability of our TPE technology to increase the permeability of the intestinal epithelial layer and therefore absorb molecules of different shapes, sizes and doses. As a result of these studies, we believe that our TPE technology can be applied to multiple additional peptide drug products as well as small molecules with poor bioavailability.

 Our TPE Platform 
 

Although not currently staffed or sufficiently financed to do so, if octreotide capsules are approved in acromegaly, we may seek to use our TPE platform to develop other oral medications to help improve the lives of patients suffering from other debilitating diseases that are currently being treated with injectable therapies. If we pursue new peptide-based drugs to develop using our TPE platform, to potentially reduce the development time and expenses and overall level of investment required, where possible, we may focus our efforts on drugs for which we may utilize the FDAs 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway in the United States and the hybrid application pathway, which is analogous to the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, in the European Union. In March 2017, the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development reported that the FDAs 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for new drug applications in the United States has not led to shorter approval times. With octreotide capsules, we brought a TPE-based product candidate from concept to the first clinical trial within 18 months and then initiated our first Phase 3 clinical trial approximately two years later. 
 Prior License Agreement with Roche 
 In January 2013, we entered into a license agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., collectively Roche, for the development and commercialization of octreotide capsules. Under the terms of the license agreement, we had responsibility for continued clinical development through completion of our initial Phase 3 clinical trial, establishment of commercial-scale manufacturing and completion of ongoing nonclinical activities. Roche assumed responsibility for development and commercialization thereafter. The agreement provided for an upfront payment of $65.0 million, future consideration of up to $530 million in development and commercial milestones, and the right to receive tiered, double-digit royalties on net sales of octreotide capsules. 
 In January 2014, we received the clinical results from the seven-month core treatment period of the octreotide capsules Phase 3 clinical trial. These results did not include the six-month extension period of the trial, which allowed patients the opportunity to choose to continue on oral therapy. In May 2014, Roche conducted a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA. In July 2014, Roche elected to terminate the license agreement and transitioned octreotide capsules and all materials related to the clinical development programs back to us. We subsequently entered into a termination agreement with Roche, which included our purchase of active pharmaceutical ingredient for future manufacturing of octreotide capsules and a trademark associated with octreotide capsules for an aggregate of $5.1 million payable over three years. We have made all such payments and have no further obligations to Roche. 
 In October 2014, we completed analyses of the full 13-month clinical results from our Phase 3 clinical trial of octreotide capsules. Subsequently, in December 2014, we met with the FDA to discuss our clinical development of octreotide capsules, including the full 13-month data from our Phase 3 clinical trial. At this meeting, the FDA advised us that it had not identified an issue that would preclude us from submitting an NDA for review. 
 
19 


  However, the FDA did advise us that interpreting efficacy from a voluntary long-term extension study is subject to limitations and therefore the data at the seven-month time point in our Phase 3 clinical trial would carry more weight in the efficacy evaluation than the extension data. The FDA also informed us that, in its view, a single-arm study was not as informative as a controlled study, such as an active control trial using a non-inferiority design, and that the interpretability of the efficacy findings we submitted from our single-arm study, and whether these findings are robust enough to warrant approval, would be review issues as the FDA evaluated our NDA. We submitted our NDA to the FDA in June 2015. In April 2016, the FDA issued a CRL to our NDA. 
 Commercialization Strategy 
 We retain worldwide rights to develop and commercialize octreotide capsules with no royalty obligations to third parties. If approved, we may commercialize octreotide capsules ourselves in the United States employing a strategy that differentiates our product and is tailored to the needs of patients and their physicians. Prior to the receipt of the CRL, we conducted market research with endocrinologists, nurses and patients with acromegaly and other pre-commercial activities in the United States to better understand satisfaction levels and key unmet needs with respect to current treatments for acromegaly and to build awareness of octreotide capsules. In surveys commissioned by us, more than 80% of patients with acromegaly expressed a preference for an oral treatment, and endocrinologists surveyed predicted that an oral treatment would ultimately become the preferred treatment option. Endocrinologists indicated that effectiveness in at least 50% of patients treated would be sufficient for an oral treatment to generally be prescribed by physicians. To assess the attitudes of commercial third-party payors toward reimbursement for octreotide capsules, in 2010 we conducted research with 12 such payors collectively representing 111 million covered lives. Payors representing nearly 90% of these covered lives said they would reimburse an oral treatment assuming pricing was in a range comparable to the existing injectable therapy market leader, octreotide. Additional U.S. payor and pricing research will be necessary to inform our commercialization strategy if any NDA we may submit for octreotide capsules in acromegaly is approved. 
 Based on our evaluation of the acromegaly market in 2016, we believe the U.S. market for acromegaly treatments is concentrated. We believe that approximately 8,000 adult acromegaly patients are chronically treated with somatostatin analogs in the United States, and that approximately 90% of these patients are managed by fewer than 1,000 patient care centers. Patients with acromegaly undergoing treatment in the United States are generally treated by endocrinologists at a small number of academic institutions with pituitary experts (pituitary centers), regional academic centers or hospital systems (regional referral centers) and some community endocrinologists. We believe we will be able to market octreotide capsules, if approved, to these patient care centers. We believe that the clinical benefits, if demonstrated, and preferences of patients and healthcare professionals for an oral therapy together with our planned patient-centric approach could enable octreotide capsules, if approved, to become a new standard of care in acromegaly. 
 Subject to resolution of our planned NDA and assuming positive data in our ongoing Phase 3 MPOWERED clinical trial, we intend to submit an MAA to the EMA to enable us to commercialize octreotide capsules in the European Union. We plan to explore the strategic merits of collaboration opportunities for commercializing octreotide capsules in the European Union and the rest of the world in order to maximize the availability of the product candidate, if approved, to patients. However, depending on our evaluation of the strategic merits of these collaboration opportunities, we may decide to retain commercial rights in key markets. 
 Manufacturing 
 We depend on third-party suppliers and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for all of our required raw materials and drug substance and to manufacture and package drug product for clinical use and commercial use, if approved. If octreotide capsules are approved, we plan to establish a distribution channel in the United States utilizing third-party logistics and specialty pharmacies to distribute product directly to patients who have been prescribed octreotide capsules.

 We have qualified Novetide Ltd., a subsidiary of Teva API Pharmaceuticals Industries (TAPI) Ltd., in Israel, and Bachem Americas Inc., in the United States, as suppliers of the generic active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, octreotide acetate. 
 All excipients, or substances formulated together with the API, used in manufacture of octreotide capsules are readily available. The octreotide API is formulated with our TPE technology by Lyophilization Services of New England Inc. and filled into capsules and enteric-coated by Capsugel, a division of Lonza, in Scotland. All manufacturers periodically undergo inspections by regulatory authorities. 
 Octreotide capsules are intended to be refrigerated and our NDA included primary stability data covering 24 months under these storage conditions. We have also obtained data regarding additional one-month storage at room temperature. The FDA has previously indicated that the testing parameters for our control strategy and product release and stability specifications are acceptable. The manufacturing process for the API has been validated at both of our API manufacturers and octreotide capsules manufactured at our CMOs as well as final product packaging has also been validated. In the CRL, the FDA advised that, during a site inspection, certain deficiencies were conveyed to the representative of one of our suppliers that would need to be resolved before approval of our NDA. In December 2016, we were informed that the supplier had recently received its EIR from the FDA. The receipt of the EIR is an indication that the FDA has concluded its inspection of the supplier and as of the date of its report considers outstanding deficiencies resolved. We expect that our suppliers will be subject to additional regulatory inspections in the future, including in connection with the FDAs review of any NDA we may submit in the future seeking approval of octreotide capsules in acromegaly. 
 Competition 
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change as researchers learn more about diseases and develop new technologies and treatments. Our potential competitors include primarily large pharmaceutical, biotechnology companies and specialty pharmaceutical companies. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of octreotide capsules, if approved, and any other product candidates we may develop are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of administration, price and reimbursement and effectiveness of our promotional activities. 
 The standards of care for patients suffering from acromegaly all involve injectable therapies, other than cabergoline, an oral agent used for the treatment of mild acromegaly. Novartis markets octreotide LAR, which is administered monthly and intramuscularly using a large gauge needle. Ipsen markets lanreotide, another long-acting analog of somatostatin, like octreotide, which is administered monthly using a deep subcutaneous injection. Both therapies, which are most frequently the first drug treatment options for patients, involve side effects related to the injections and inconvenience due to the timing and requirements of the injections. Pfizer markets pegvisomant daily injections and Novartis also markets pasireotide LAR, which is another somatostatin analog administered via intramuscular injection. Pegvisomant daily injections and pasireotide LAR are significantly more costly than injectable octreotide and lanreotide. The label for pasireotide LAR includes a warning about hyperglycemia and diabetes, which can sometimes be severe. The label advises healthcare professionals administering pasireotide LAR to monitor glucose levels periodically during therapy and to monitor glucose levels more frequently in the months that follow initiation or discontinuation of therapy and following dose adjustment. We are aware of other companies involved in early-stage nonclinical and clinical studies of similar somatostatin analogs, but most involve administration via injection. Most notably, Camurus AB is developing CAM2029, a subcutaneous octreotide depot for the potential treatment of neuroendocrine tumors and acromegaly. Published reports indicate that Camurus AB intends to initiate a Phase 3 acromegaly trial in the second half of 2019. MidaTech Pharma PLC also recently conducted its first in human study of Q-Octreotide (MTD201), Midatechs injectable treatment for acromegaly built on its Q-Sphera sustained release platform technology. In 2018, Crinetics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced the planned initiation of two Phase 2 clinical trials in 2019 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CRN00808 in acromegaly patients. CRN00808 is a nonpeptide somatostatin agonist designed to be taken orally once per day. In May 2017, Dauntless

  Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately held biopharmaceutical company, announced positive results from its two-part, Phase 1 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study evaluating DP1038, a novel formulation of octreotide acetate for intranasal administration. In 2018, Ionis Pharmaceuticals initiated a Phase 2 trial of IONIS-GHR-LRx, its growth hormone receptor antagonist to control growth hormone production in acromegaly patients. We are also aware of other companies such as Rani Therapeutics (RaniPillTM capsule containing octreotide) and Strongbridge Biopharm (valdoreotide, or COR-005) who may also be actively developing products for the maintenance treatment of acromegaly. If any or a combination of the other product candidates in development for acromegaly receive regulatory approval before, or in a similar timeframe as, our octreotide capsules, or demonstrate superior clinical results to octreotide capsules, we may encounter significant difficulties with our commercial launch of octreotide capsules, if approved. 
 Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval of drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors drugs, or drugs they may develop in the future, may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render octreotide capsules or any future product candidates we may develop obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing octreotide capsules or any future product candidates we may develop. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval of ours. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and more advanced technologies become available. If we are unable to compete effectively, our opportunity to generate revenue from the sale of octreotide capsules or any future product candidates we may develop, if approved, will be adversely affected. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to compositions, methods of treatment, and dosage regimens identified in the course of our business. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions. 
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and patent scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors. 
 
22 


 Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, to determine priority of invention. 
 Patents 
 As of March 7, 2019, our patent portfolio includes five patents issued in the United States; one patent application for which an issue fee has been paid, and which is due to be granted on March 26, 2019; patents issued in foreign jurisdictions; patent applications pending in the United States; and patent applications pending in various foreign jurisdictions. These patents and patent applications include narrow and broad claims directed to polypeptide compositions including octreotide compositions formulated with our TPE technology; capsules containing such compositions; methods of treatment using such compositions; and methods of making various compositions with our TPE technology. This patent family includes three issued U.S. patents and one pending patent application with claims directed to enteric-coated oral dosage form comprising octreotide compositions, capsules containing octreotide compositions, and methods of treating various conditions with related octreotide compositions. Other patents in this family have issued in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom, and patent applications are pending in other jurisdictions, including Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel and Korea, Mexico, Russia, Australia, and Japan. Patents in this family are expected to expire in 2029, absent any adjustments or extensions. This patent family includes an issued U.S. patent with claims relating to enteric-coated oral dosage form comprising polypeptide compositions. 
 We also own a family of patent applications directed to a dosage regimen for octreotide and also directed to methods of treating acromegaly with certain octreotide-containing compositions and dosage regimens, which has entered the National Phase. There are pending applications in the United States and abroad. Patents issuing from any U.S. nonprovisional and foreign-filed applications claiming priority to this PCT application are expected to expire in 2036, absent any adjustments or extensions. This patent is due to be granted on March 26, 2019 and will expire in 2036. 
 Additionally, we own two U.S. utility patents directed to proprietary packaging for distribution of octreotide capsules which are expected to expire in 2035, absent any adjustments or extensions. We also own two U.S. design patents, which have been granted in several other jurisdictions and are expected to expire in the U.S. in 2030 and 2033. 
 Finally, we own a family of patents application directed to further uses of our TPE technology which have entered the National Phase. Patents issuing from any U.S. nonprovisional and foreign-filed applications claiming priority to this PCT application are expected to expire in 2035, absent any adjustments or extensions. 
 Patent Term 
 The base term of a U.S. utility patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority. The base term of a U.S. design patent is 14 years from issuance for designs filed before the Patent Law Treaties Implementation Act of 2012 which took effect on May 13, 2015 and 15 years from issuance for designs filed after May 13, 2015. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the USPTO. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent. 
Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, 
 
23 


  packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products such as our product candidate, octreotide capsules. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. 
 United States Drug Development 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, voluntary product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Octreotide capsules must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before it may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

 | completion of extensive nonclinical, or preclinical, laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDAs Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical study related regulations, sometimes referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


 | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDAs current good manufacturing practice requirements, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drugs identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct development stages: nonclinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the nonclinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or published literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to 
 
24 


  the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated. 
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers and/or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsors control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completion. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
 Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, and may overlap. Phase 1 generally involves a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these studies is to assess the metabolism, pharmacological action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug. Phase 2 trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy. Phase 3 trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase 3 trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. 
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting, written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsors initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical 
 
25 


  trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. The clinical trial sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 NDA and FDA Review Process 
 Following trial completion, trial data are analyzed to assess safety and efficacy. The results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA in an NDA along with proposed labeling for the product and information about the manufacturing process and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality, results of analytical testing conducted on the chemistry of the drug, and other relevant information. The NDA is a request for approval to market the drug and must contain proof of safety and efficacy, which is demonstrated by extensive nonclinical and clinical testing. The application includes both negative or ambiguous results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before marketing a drug in the United States. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. An NDA applicant must submit to the FDA a pediatric study plan typically 60 days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. Because octreotide capsules received orphan drug designation for the treatment of acromegaly, we do not need to comply with the requirements of PREA at this time. If, however, we seek other indications for octreotide capsules or pursue approval of any other product candidate that does not have orphan drug designation, we may need to comply with PREA or otherwise seek a waiver. 
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt and within 30 days of receipt for an NDA resubmission. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. The decision to accept the NDA for filing means that the FDA has made a threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from the receipt of an NDA for a non-new molecular entity in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 
26 


 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMPs to assure and preserve the products identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application or request a hearing. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. 
 There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a drug product for marketing in the United States, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 FDAs NDA Resubmission Policy Following a Complete Response Letter 
 Under the FDAs policies and procedures, an NDA that is resubmitted following the issuance of a CRL will be evaluated by the FDA to determine whether the resubmission addresses all of the deficiencies raised in the CRL. 
 
27 


  If so, the FDA will classify the resubmission as either Class 1 or Class 2. The FDA will review and act on Class 1 resubmissions within two months of the NDA receipt date and on Class 2 resubmissions within six months of the NDA receipt date. As the resubmission of an NDA that involves the safety and efficacy data of a new Phase 3 clinical trial does not meet the criteria of a Class 1 resubmission, we expect that our NDA for octreotide capsules, if resubmitted, will qualify as a Class 2 resubmission, if it is determined to address all of the deficiencies raised in our CRL. Data from CHIASMA OPTIMAL, if positive, should support our NDA resubmission in the United States, which we anticipate resubmitting by year-end 2019. 
 505(b)(2) Approval Process 
 Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA provides an alternate regulatory pathway for the FDA to approve a new drug and permits reliance for such approval on published literature or an FDA finding of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product. Specifically, section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon published literature and/or the FDAs findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug. Typically, 505(b)(2) applicants must perform additional trials to support the change from the previously approved drug and to further demonstrate the new drugs safety and effectiveness. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 Our product candidate, octreotide capsules, is based upon an already approved version of the same drug in an immediate-release formulation for subcutaneous injection, rather than a new chemical entity product candidate. Accordingly, we expect to be able to rely on information from previously conducted studies involving the immediate-release subcutaneous octreotide product in our clinical development plans and our NDA resubmission, if resubmitted. 
 Post-Marketing Requirements 
 Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse events with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, and product sampling and distribution requirements in accordance with the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, a part of the FDCA. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process. 
 Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion and advertising, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. In addition, a pharmaceutical company must comply with restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drugs approved labeling (known as off-label use), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. 
 In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. We rely on third parties for the production of clinical quantities of octreotide capsules and expect to rely on third parties for the production of commercial quantities of our octreotide capsules, in both cases in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and 
 
28 


  documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. 
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a products approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDAs policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development and impact approved products already on the market. 
 Other Regulatory Matters 
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, voluntary recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or effectiveness of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. 
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the voluntary recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
 Orphan Designation and Exclusivity 
 The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Alternatively, orphan drug designation may be available if the disease or the condition affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable

  expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. 
 Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product is the first to receive FDA approval of the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. 
 U.S. Marketing Exclusivity 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDA provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, adds six months of exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection and patent term, and may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a trial. 
 Other Regulations 
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection and fire hazard control. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. 
European Orphan Designation and Exclusivity 
 In the European Union, the European Commission, after reviewing the opinion of the EMAs Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community, or when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of such products in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the products. Additionally, orphan drug designation is only available where no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). 
 In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Market exclusivity would not prevent the approval of a similar drug that is shown to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior. 
 
30 


 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government healthcare program administrative authorities, managed care organizations, private health insurers, and other entities. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Therefore, our products, if approved, may not obtain market acceptance unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. 
 The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved. Moreover, a third-party payors decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved or that any required patient cost-sharing amount will be acceptable to the patient. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor and among the insured lives of an individual payor depending upon the benefits applicable to the insured person. One third-party payors decision to cover a particular drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process. 
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular drug products and are increasingly challenging the prices charged for drug products and medical services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new drug products are typically made by CMS, an agency within the HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new drug product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors and coverage and reimbursement levels for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. In many countries, the prices of drug products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of drug products under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for drug products may be reduced compared with the United States. 
 The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have also shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including 
 
31 


  price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies share of sales to federal health care programs. Some of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. For example, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA, including eliminating a tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The Trump administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018 the same judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal. It is unclear how this decision and any subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. Thus, the full impact of the Affordable Care Act, or any law replacing elements of it, on our business remains unclear. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals. 
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health develop research plans and periodically report on the status of the research and related expenditures to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for governmental or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitors product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates, if and once approved. 
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower. 
 Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws and Other Regulatory Matters 
 In the United States, among other things, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products are potentially subject to regulation and enforcement by various federal, state and local authorities in 
 
32 


  addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, state attorneys general and other state and local government agencies. Our current and future business activities, including for example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with healthcare regulatory laws, including the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal False Claims Act, as amended, the privacy regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended, physician payment transparency laws, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the intent standard under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal False Claims Act. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti-kickback laws, and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future business activities, including our sales and marketing practices and/or our future relationships with endocrinologists and other healthcare providers might be challenged under anti-kickback laws, which could harm us. 
 The Federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent. This statute has been interpreted to prohibit presenting claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding 
 
33 


  information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been found liable under the Federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $11,181 and $22,363 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the Federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the Federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the Federal False Claims Act. 
 Similarly, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 Additionally, HIPAA created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
 The ACA included a provision commonly referred to as the Sunshine Act, which requires certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and report annually certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any transfer of value provided, as well as any ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Covered manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. The information reported is publicly available and searchable on the CMS website. There are also an increasing number of state and foreign laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states or foreign governments on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state, federal or foreign authorities. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. We are engaging in significant efforts to establish systems and processes in order to comply with these laws and regulations. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements would result in significant civil monetary penalties. 
 In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes certain of HIPAAs privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as an entity that performs certain functions that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
 In addition to HIPAA and HITECH, other federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, 
 
34 


  use and disclosure of personal information. For example, in June 2018 California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act which takes effect on January 1, 2020 and will broadly define personal information, give California residents expanded privacy rights and protections, provide civil penalties for violations, and create a private right of action and statutory damages for victims of data breaches. Other states are considering similar laws. Many state laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Various foreign countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. 
 The failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements subjects us to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Even if we are not determined to have violated applicable regulatory or legal requirements, government investigations into alleged violations typically requires the expenditure of significant resources and could generate negative publicity, which could harm our business. 
 Affordable Care Act and Other Reform Initiatives 
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. 
 In March 2010, the ACA was enacted. The ACA includes measures that have significantly changed, and are expected to continue to significantly change, the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following: 
 

 | The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services in exchange for state Medicaid coverage of most of the manufacturers drugs. ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic products to 23.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, and adding a new rebate calculation for line extensions (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, with the exception of childrens hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs used in orphan indications. In addition, because 340B pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid drug rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discounts to increase. The ACA imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic agents to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D beneficiaries in the coverage gap (i.e., donut hole). The required discount was increased to 70% on January 1, 2019 pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.

35 


 
 | The ACA imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The ACA included the Sunshine Act, which required certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to track and annually report to CMS certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any transfer of value provided, as well as any ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The ACA established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The ACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation through 2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, that while not a law, is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the ACA. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called Cadillac tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plan, the annual fee imposed on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the donut hole. Congress may consider other legislation to modify, repeal, or replace elements of the ACA. Thus, the full impact of the ACA, or any law replacing elements of it, on our business remains unclear. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislations automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional congressional action is taken. In January 2013, former President Barack 
 
36 


  Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may adversely affect our future profitability. 
 European Union Drug Development 
 In the European Union, octreotide capsules and any future product candidates we may develop will also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if marketing authorizations from the competent regulatory agencies have been obtained. 
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of nonclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. 
 On April 16, 2014, the European Commission adopted Clinical Trial Regulation EU No. 536/2014 in an effort to ensure that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical. The new regulation, among other things, will implement a streamlined application procedure with a single entry point for review, harmonize the process for assessing applications for clinical trials, simplify reporting procedures, and increase transparency regarding clinical trials and their outcomes. The regulation, however, will not become applicable until six months after the European Commission publishes a notice of the confirmation of the full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System through an independent audit. Until then, the current law, Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, continues to govern all clinical trials performed in the EU. 
 European Union Drug Review and Approval 
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations: 
 The Community MA, is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, such as octreotide capsules, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. 
 National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved 
 
37 


  simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e. in the RMS and the Member States Concerned). 
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug review and approval, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time in the EEA and other foreign territories may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
 Employees 
 As of March 1, 2019, we had 18 full-time employees located in the United States and in Israel. While none of our employees are represented by a labor union or party to any collective bargaining agreement, certain provisions of the collective bargaining agreements between the Histadrut (General Federation of Labor in Israel) and the Coordination Bureau of Economic Organizations (including the Industrialists Associations) are applicable to our employees in Israel by extension orders issued by the Israel Ministry of Economy (previously the Israeli Ministry of Trade, Industry and Labor). 
 Israeli labor laws principally govern the length of the workday, minimum wages for employees, procedures for hiring and dismissing employees, determination of severance pay, annual leave, sick days, advance notice of termination of employment, equal opportunity and anti-discrimination laws and other conditions of employment. Subject to certain exceptions, Israeli law generally requires severance pay upon the retirement, death or dismissal of an employee, and requires us and our employees to make payments to the National Insurance Institute, which is similar to the U.S. Social Security Administration. Our Israeli employees have defined-benefit pension plans that comply with applicable Israeli legal requirements, which also include the mandatory pension payments required by applicable law and allocations for severance pay. 
 Although we experienced two separate reductions in force in 2016 aggregating greater than 60% of our workforce following our receipt of the CRL, we have never experienced any employment-related work stoppages and believe our relationship with our remaining employees is good. 
 Research and Development 
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, our total research and development expense was $22.4 million compared to $17.9 million and $31.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to increased costs related to the CHIASMA OPTIMAL clinical trial which we initiated in September 2017, and the MPOWERED trial and were partially offset by reduced personnel costs associated with the transition of our former Chief Development Officer from a full-time employee to a member of the board of directors of both our company and our Israeli subsidiary. The decrease in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to approximately $7.4 million of API purchases and pre-commercial manufacturing validation activities during 2016, that did not reoccur in 2017, as well as reduced compensation-related costs and other research and development program efforts following the reductions of force in June and August 2016. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in clinical trial costs of $1.3 million.
