Regulation
Our business is heavily regulated and we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations, including Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government and other contracts. These regulations set forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government and impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting and include procurement, import and export, security, contract termination and adjustment, and audit requirements. In addition, these regulations govern contract pricing and reimbursable costs by, among other things, requiring certification and disclosure of cost or pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations, defining allowable and unallowable costs, and otherwise governing the right to reimbursement under various flexibly priced contracts. These laws and regulations impose specific cost accounting practices that may increase accounting and internal control costs associated with compliance with government standards. The U.S. government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time. Our compliance with these regulations is monitored by the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA).
The U.S. government has the ability to cancel contracts at any time through a termination for the convenience of the U.S. government. Most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and contract profit for work performed when the U.S. government issues a termination for convenience.
Some of our operations and service offerings involve our access to and use of personally identifiable information and protected health information, which activities are regulated by extensive federal and state privacy and data security laws requiring organizations to provide certain privacy protections and security safeguards for such information.
Internationally, we are subject to foreign government laws and regulations, and U.S. government laws, regulations, and procurement policies and practices (including laws and regulations relating to bribery of foreign government officials, import and export control, investments, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings). We are also susceptible to varying political and economic risks.
In order to help ensure compliance with these complex laws and regulations, we have established policies and procedures that address our approach to meeting these requirements and also administer a robust ethics and compliance training program to maintain a compliance-oriented workforce.
These regulations and risks affecting our business are described in more detail under “Risk Factors” in this report.
Contracts
We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government and other contracts. The U.S. government procurement environment has evolved due to statutory and regulatory procurement reform initiatives. Budgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have increasingly caused many U.S. government agencies to purchase services and solutions using contracting processes that give them the ability to select multiple winners or pre-qualify certain contractors to provide various services or solutions on established general terms and conditions rather than through single award contracts. The predominant contracting methods through which U.S. government agencies procure services and solutions include the following:
Single Award Contracts. U.S. government agencies may procure services and solutions through single award contracts, which specify the scope of work that will be delivered and identify the contractor that will provide the specified services. When an agency has a requirement, interested contractors are solicited, qualified and then provided with a request for proposal. The process of qualifying prospective bidders, soliciting proposals and evaluating contractor bids requires the agency to maintain a large, professional procurement staff and the bidding and selection process can take a year or more to complete. This method of contracting may provide the contractor with greater certainty of the timing and amounts to be received at the time of contract award because it generally results in the customer contracting for a specific scope of work from the single successful awardee.

SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION

Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts. The U.S. government uses IDIQ contracts to obtain commitments from contractors to provide certain services or solutions on pre-established terms and conditions. The U.S. government then issues task orders under the IDIQ contracts to purchase the specific services or solutions it needs. IDIQ contracts are awarded to one or more contractors following a competitive procurement process. Under a single award IDIQ contract, all task orders under that contract are awarded to one pre-selected contractor. Under a multi-award IDIQ contract, task orders can be awarded to any of the pre-selected contractors, which can result in further limited competition for the award of task orders. Multi-award IDIQ contracts that are open for any government agency to use for the procurement of services are commonly referred to as “government-wide acquisition contracts.” IDIQ contracts often have multi-year terms and unfunded ceiling amounts that enable, but not commit, the U.S. government to purchase substantial amounts of services or solutions from one or more contractors. At the time an IDIQ contract is awarded (prior to the letting of any task orders), a contractor may have limited or no visibility as to the ultimate amount of services or solutions that the U.S. government will purchase under the contract, and, in the case of a multi-award IDIQ, the contractor from which such purchases may be made.
U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule Contracts. The GSA maintains listings of approved suppliers of services and solutions with pre-negotiated prices for use throughout the U.S. government. In order for a company to provide services under a GSA Schedule contract, a company must be pre-qualified and awarded a contract by the GSA. When an agency uses a GSA Schedule to meet its requirements, the agency (or the GSA on behalf of the agency) conducts the procurement and bidders are limited to GSA Schedule-qualified contractors. GSA Schedule contracts are designed to provide the user agency with reduced procurement time and lower procurement costs. Similar to IDIQ contracts, at the time a GSA Schedule contract is awarded, a contractor may have limited or no visibility as to the ultimate amount of services or solutions that customers will ultimately purchase under the contract.
Contract Types
Generally, the type of contract used for the acquisition of our services and solutions is determined by or negotiated with the U.S. government and may depend on certain factors, including: the type and complexity of the work to be performed; degree and timing of the responsibility to be assumed by the contractor for the costs of performance; the extent of price competition; and the amount and nature of the profit incentive offered to the contractor for achieving or exceeding specified standards or goals. We generate revenues under several types of contracts, including the following:
•Cost-reimbursement contracts provide for reimbursement of our direct contract costs and allocable indirect costs, plus a fee (contract profit). This type of contract is generally used when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use a fixed-price contract. Cost-reimbursement contracts usually subject us to lower risk and generally require us to use our best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within a specified time and amount of costs.
•Time-and-materials (T&M) contracts typically provide for negotiated fixed hourly rates for specified categories of direct labor plus reimbursement of other direct costs. This type of contract is generally used when there is uncertainty of the extent or duration of the work to be performed by the contractor at the time of contract award or it is not possible to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. On T&M contracts, we assume the risk of providing appropriately qualified staff to perform these contracts at the hourly rates set forth in the contracts over their period of performance.
•Firm-fixed price (FFP) contracts provide for a predetermined price for specific solutions. These contracts offer us potential increased profits if we can complete the work at lower costs than planned. While FFP contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, these contracts also increase our exposure to reduced profits or losses from increased or unexpected costs.
Our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract, the nature of services or solutions provided, as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees is finally determined. Given the relative amount of risk assumed by the contractor, cost-reimbursement and T&M contracts generally have lower profitability than FFP contracts. For the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract for the last three fiscal years, see “Other Key Performance Measures—Contract Types” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this report.

Backlog
Backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts as work is performed. Our backlog consists of funded backlog and negotiated unfunded backlog. At January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021 our total backlog was $24.1 billion and $21.5 billion, respectively. For a complete description of our backlog, see “Other Key Performance Measures—Net Bookings and Backlog” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this report.
Competition
Competition for contracts is intense and we often compete against a large number of established multinational companies, which may have greater name recognition, financial resources and larger technical staffs than we do. We also compete against smaller, more specialized companies that concentrate their resources on particular areas, as well as the U.S. government’s own capabilities. As a result of the diverse requirements of the U.S. government, we frequently collaborate with other companies to compete for large contracts and bid against these same companies in other situations. Our principal competitors include the following:
•the engineering and technical services divisions of large defense contractors that provide IT services in addition to other hardware systems and products, which include companies such as General Dynamics Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, and Raytheon Technologies Corporation;
•contractors focused principally on technical and IT services, such as Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., CACI International, Inc., Leidos Holdings, Inc., ManTech International Corporation, and Serco Group plc;
•diversified commercial providers that also provide U.S. government IT services, such as Accenture plc and International Business Machines Corporation; and
•contractors providing supply chain management and other logistics services, such as Agility Logistics Corporation and SupplyCore.
We compete on various factors, which include: our technical expertise and qualified and/or security-cleared personnel; our ability to deliver innovative cost-effective solutions in a timely manner; successful program execution on previous programs; our reputation and standing with customers; pricing; and the size and geographic presence of our Company.
Competition within the government services industry has intensified, which has led to fewer sole-source awards and an increased emphasis on cost competitiveness and affordability. In addition, procurement initiatives to improve efficiency, refocus priorities, increase small business awards and enhance best practices could result in fewer new opportunities for our industry as a whole, which would intensify competition within the industry as companies compete for a more limited set of new programs.
Patents and Proprietary Information
Our technical services and solutions are not generally dependent on patent protection, although we do selectively seek patent protection. We claim a proprietary interest in certain of our solutions, software programs, methodologies and know-how. This proprietary information is protected by copyrights, trade secrets, licenses, contracts and other means. We selectively pursue opportunities to license or transfer our technologies to third parties.
In connection with the performance of services, the U.S. government has certain rights to inventions, data, software codes and related material that we develop under U.S. government-funded contracts and subcontracts. Generally, the U.S. government may disclose or license such information to third parties, including, in some instances, our competitors. In the case of some subcontracts that we perform, the prime contractor may also have certain rights to the programs and solutions that we develop under the subcontract.

People and Culture
Overview
SAIC’s purpose is to advance the power of technology and innovation to serve and protect our world. We achieve our purpose with and through our people, who are fundamental to our success. Our values underpin our culture and are at the heart of how we operate:
•Passion: Love what you do
•Empowerment: Decide and act
•Integrity: Be real
•Inclusion: Embrace differences
•Innovation: Think courageously
Attracting and retaining top talent is an essential element of SAIC’s business strategy and our value proposition for our shareholders, customers, and employees. To deliver on this strategy, we seek to be a company that provides meaningful work and purpose, and creates a fulfilling and differentiated experience for our employees. Our investments in our employees drive a productive, innovative and inclusive culture, where our people are empowered to be their best authentic selves and to do their best work. 
As of January 28, 2022, we employed approximately 26,000 employees, of which 93% are full time with the majority located in the United States. 
To cultivate a differentiated employee experience, we are focused on fostering a flexible work environment, strengthening diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I), and enhancing employee well-being.
Fostering flexibility
The pandemic has caused people to re-evaluate their priorities and expectations about work. Flexibility of work schedule and location is a key reason why people join and stay at companies, and we are creating an environment at SAIC where our employees can use the power of flexibility to thrive. 
We implemented flexible work schedules including a 4-day workweek and other schedule options and increased remote and hybrid work opportunities. Our definition of flexibility is not a one-size fits all, rather it is tailored and nurtured through the engagement between our employees and their leaders. 
Flexibility has helped us widen the talent pool and attract and retain highly skilled people in extremely sought after disciplines such as science, technology, engineering and cybersecurity. During fiscal 2022, we hired more than 5,800 new employees and kept voluntary turnover below our industry’s average rate. 
Strengthening diversity, equity, and inclusion
Our ongoing diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts demonstrate our continuing promise to share our intentions, to hold ourselves accountable, and to be transparent about both our progress and our areas of opportunity. We believe diversity creates unparalleled innovation and is critical to the delivery of exceptional business results. 
We seek to drive tangible change through our commitments to:
1.Fight racism, bias, and prejudice in our workplace.
2.Make SAIC more inclusive and diverse. 
3.Support non-profit organizations that are uplifting people of color in our communities. 
4.Measure and hold ourselves accountable for results. 
The strength of our leadership is greatest when it fully reflects the diversity of our workforce. In fiscal 2022, we established goals to achieve parity in the representation of women and people of color between our leadership and non-leadership roles within five years. We made meaningful progress toward our goals this year, with women now representing 27% of our leadership and people of color representing 22%. 
While we have achieved parity between women in leader and non-leader roles and made considerable progress toward our people of color leader representation goal, we know there is more work to be done. To hold ourselves 

SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION

accountable for results, SAIC’s executive compensation incentive plans are tied to meeting our diversity goals. As of January 28, 2022, our diversity representation was:

SAIC Leaders | 27% Women | 22% People of Color
SAIC Non-leader Employees | 27% Women | 33% People of Color

To build our diversity pipeline, we instituted a new approach to ensure SAIC job descriptions, recruiting tools and processes eliminated the potential for bias, and we required a diverse slate of candidates for leadership roles. We launched the AcceleratHER Women's Leadership Academy, a nomination-based development and mentoring program focused on accelerating the advancement of SAIC's high-potential women. 
Among our efforts to fight racism, bias, and prejudice in the workplace, we added unconscious bias training as a requirement for all new employees and continued to require that all leaders complete our “From Unconscious Bias to Inclusion” training course.
As an important demonstration of SAIC’s commitment to advance diversity, equity and inclusion, we added Juneteenth as a paid holiday for our employees, being one of the first in our industry to do so. Our employees are encouraged to actively participate in our multiple employee resource groups (ERG) where they can enhance their personal networks and their sense of belonging. This year, we added a new accessibility ERG to advocate and support employees and their family members with visible and non-visible disabilities including mental health and neurodiversity.
Our progress on our DE&I initiatives has been recognized: SAIC is a Forbes 2022 Best Large Employers; a Forbes America’s Best Employers for Veterans; a Human Rights Campaign Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality; and a Forbes Best Employers for Diversity. We are honored that 23% of our employees are veterans of the U.S. armed forces.
Enhancing employee well-being
Through our annual culture survey, we gather confidential feedback from our employees to learn how we can improve our efforts to provide an exceptional employee experience. To ensure all levels of management understand employee sentiment, every individual leader receives aggregated results to develop an action plan to address their team’s needs. Strengths and opportunities are identified leading to focused investments to build on our cultural strengths and address areas for improvement. Training to upskill our leaders in coaching, enhancing team well-being, and engaging hybrid teams inclusively was implemented this year as a result of survey feedback.
Additionally, we invest in our people through technical and professional skills training, leadership development programs, higher education programs and tuition assistance programs for continuing education or industry certification. In fiscal 2022, our employees completed approximately 134,000 hours of training including 55,000 hours of ethics and compliance training. Our leaders completed over 11,000 hours of leadership development training. 
SAIC provides wide-ranging options to support employees’ well-being, including an Employee Assistance Program and a wellness program. This year, based on employee feedback, we substantially raised paid family leave to further support parents and multi-generational families and offered company-subsidized backup child and elder care. Additionally, for the second year in a row, SAIC is fully covering the increased costs of employee premiums in the Company’s medical insurance plans and holding employee premiums flat.
Employee health and safety is paramount to our business and contributes to our employees’ well-being. We encourage employees to prevent workplace hazards and engage in health and wellness initiatives. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our priority has been the safety and well-being of our employees and business partners. We continue to closely monitor COVID-19 matters and provide comprehensive resources and programs for managing through the pandemic, working virtually and handling associated stress as well as sharing timely information on the topic.

Seasonality
The U.S. government’s fiscal year ends on September 30. It is not uncommon for U.S. government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions leading up to the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds, which may favorably impact our third fiscal quarter. In addition, revenues may be unfavorably impacted during our fourth fiscal quarter due to a greater number of holidays and higher utilization of vacation time.
Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations. 
SAIC is committed to being a good steward of the environment through assessing, mitigating and reducing the impact we have on the world around us. Due to the nature of our business, SAIC has limited exposure to environmental risks, yet we set self-imposed goals related to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy conservation, recycling and other important environmental initiatives. In 2014, SAIC set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 15% by 2025 and exceeded that goal by reaching the reduction of 25% in 2016. To further encourage cuts to our carbon footprint, we used 2019 as a new baseline and made significant progress in reducing emissions in 2020. Specifically, direct emissions from owned or controlled sources (Scope 1) were 25% below 2019 emissions levels, and indirect emissions from purchased electricity (Scope 2) were 21% below 2019 levels. For energy conservation, SAIC’s efforts are sharply focused on electrical energy consumption. We track and evaluate electricity consumption and efficiency at those facilities over which we have operational control. In calendar year 2020, partially due to decreased facility use as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, SAIC reduced its electrical energy consumption by 3% from 2019 levels, with a total consumption of 34,813,703 kWh. 
For additional information regarding environmental matters, see SAIC's 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report, which is expected to be issued during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and will be available on our website at www.saic.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference into and is not a part of this report.
Although we do not currently anticipate that compliance costs or the liabilities associated with environmental laws or climate change will adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations and/or cash flows, it is possible that we may incur material costs or liabilities in the future. These regulations and risks are described in more detail under “Risk Factors” in this report.
