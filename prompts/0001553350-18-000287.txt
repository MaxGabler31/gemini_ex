ITEM 1. 
BUSINESS.

We are a digital marketing and data management platform delivering the tools to reach and reveal valuable audiences. Our machine-learning technology analyzes marketing data to identify brands and content owners' core consumers and their characteristics across marketing channels. Through an omnichannel approach that integrates all aspects of the advertising experience into one platform, we discover new and measurable opportunities that amplify campaign performance and maximize profits. We derive our revenues from:

·
 sales of digital advertising campaigns to advertising agencies and brands;
 ·
 sales of media inventory through real-time bidding, or RTB, exchanges;
 ·
 sale and licensing of our SRAX Social platform and related media; and,
 ·
 creation of custom platforms for buying media on SRAX for large brands.

The core elements of our business are:

·
 Social Reality Ad Exchange or "SRAX"  Real Time Bidding sell side and buy side representation is our technology which assists publishers in delivering their media inventory to the RTB exchanges. The SRAX platform integrates multiple market-leading demand sources, including OpenX, Pubmatic and AppNexus. We also build custom platforms that allow our agency partners to launch and manage their own RTB campaigns by enabling them to directly place advertising orders on the platform dashboard and view and analyze results as they occur;

·
 SRAXmd serves ads to both Healthcare Professionals and Patients using patent-pending process and technology. Powerful first and third-party data allow us to reach more than 400,000 Healthcare Professionals and Patients with real-time ad targeting, serving banner and video ads to personal devices. Advertising agencies and pharmaceutical clients contract with us directly to secure ad space and to license the MOSEE ad targeting platform on an annual basis.

·
 SRAX Social is a social media and loyalty platform that allows brands to launch and manage their social media initiatives. Our team works with customers to identify their needs and then helps them in the creation, deployment and management of their social media presence; and

·
 SRAXfan tools enable brands and agencies to connect with sports fans at home, the stadium or out-of-home at gathering locations, such as bars, restaurants, and universities, during live sporting events.

·
 SRAXauto tools enable targeting and engagement with potential auto buyers at dealerships, auto shows, and at home across desktop and mobile environments.

We offer our customers several pricing options including cost-per-thousand-impression, commonly referred to as CPM, whereby our customers pay based on the number of times the target audience is exposed to the advertisement, and on a monthly service fee.

Marketing and sales

We market our services through our in-house sales team, which is divided into two distinct activities. One group is responsible for brand advertisers and advertising agencies, and the other is responsible for publisher acquisition and management. Our in-house marketing is focused on social media, including Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, public relations (PR), industry events and the creation of white papers which assist in our marketing efforts and are used as lead generation tools for our sales team. We also attend industry specific events such as AdTech, AdExchanger, and Salesforce annual events and local events in Los Angeles and New York.

We rely on our publishing partners to provide the media inventory that we sell and use to promote our marketing campaigns as well as to assist in driving user traffic to these campaigns.

Intellectual property

We currently rely on a combination of trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends on the protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We also enter into proprietary information and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and commercial partners and control access to, and distribution of, our software documentation and other proprietary information. Prior to our acquisition of Five Delta in December 2014, in October 2014 it filed a U.S. patent for a method and system for bidding and performance tracking using online advertisements and provisional status has been granted under 62/060,247. In addition, it claimed the benefit of a pending U.S. patent number 61/604,348 for online advertising scoring. The provisional patent application has now been converted to a non-provisional patent application number 12/960,435 and is awaiting examination by the U.S. Patent Office.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include companies who focus on the RTB market and companies who are focused on providing social media applications on a managed and self-service basis. We believe we compete based on both our ability to assist our customers to obtain the best available prices as well as our excellent customer service. The barrier to entry to our industry is low. We believe that in the future we will face increased competition from these companies as they expand their operations as well as new entrants to our industry. Most of the entities against which we compete, or may compete, are larger and have greater financial resources than our company. Competition for advertising placements among current and future suppliers of Internet navigational and informational services, high-traffic websites and Internet service providers, as well as competition with other media for advertising placements, could result in significant price competition, declining margins and reductions in advertising revenue. In addition, as we continue our efforts to expand the scope of our services, we may compete with a greater number of publishers and other media companies across an increasing range of different services, including vertical markets where competitors may have advantages in expertise, brand recognition and other areas. If existing or future competitors develop or offer products or services that provide significant performance, price, creative or other advantages over those offered by us, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected. We also compete with traditional advertising media, such as direct mail, television, radio, cable, and print, for a share of advertisers' total advertising budgets. Many current and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, greater access to advertising space on high-traffic websites, and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, and marketing resources. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we fail to compete successfully, we could lose customers or media inventory and our revenue and results of operations could decline.

BIGToken, Inc.

During the third quarter of 2017, we also announced the launch of the BIGToken project (BIGToken), an advertising-based platform initiative intended to reward consumers, by the issuance of a BIGToken who voluntarily opt-in to allow marketers greater access to their personal information. During the first quarter of 2018 we completed the incorporation of Big Token, Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary in the state of Delaware. The core of the project is our blockchain identification graph platform or BIG. The BIG platform and BIGToken is intended to generate higher quality marketing opportunities for advertisers that we believe will pay a premium to have access to better, consumer self-generated data. 

In March of 2018, we announced the Alpha launch of the BIG platform to a select group of individuals and entities. Users participating in our BIGToken Alpha will be able to create an account, integrate third party accounts and answer serves in order to create an initial data graph. Participants in the Alpha will be awarded points as opposed to a BIGToken. Although the Alpha launch was a major milestone for the BIGToken project, there can be no assurance that we will complete final development of the BIGToken project or if developed, that it will be successful. 

Government regulation

Aspects of the digital marketing and advertising industry and how our business operates are highly regulated. We are subject to a number of domestic and, to the extent our operations are conducted outside the U.S., foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and through other electronic means, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In particular, we are subject to rules of the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, and potentially other federal agencies and state laws related to our advertising content and methods, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or CAN-SPAM Act, which establishes certain requirements for commercial electronic mail messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial electronic mail messages that follow a recipient's opt-out request or are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content, and federal and state regulations covering the treatment of member data that we collect from endorsers.

U.S. and foreign regulations and laws potentially affecting our business are evolving. We have not yet developed an internal compliance program nor do we have policies in place to monitor compliance. Instead, we rely on the policies of our publishing partners and advertising clients. If we are unable to identify all regulations to which our business is subject and implement effective means of compliance, we could be subject to enforcement actions, lawsuits and penalties including, but not limited to, fines and other monetary liability or injunction that could prevent us from operating our business or certain aspects of our business. In addition, compliance with the regulations to which we are subject now or in the future may require changes to our products or services, restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business or cause users to abandon products or aspects of our services. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The FTC adopted Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising in October 2009. These guides recommend that advertisers and publishers clearly disclose in third-party endorsements made online, such as in social media, if compensation was received in exchange for said endorsements. Because some of our marketing campaigns entail the engagement of consumers to refer other consumers in their social networks to view ads or take action, and both we and the consumer may earn cash and other incentives, and any failure on our part to comply with these guides may be damaging to our business. We currently do not take any steps to monitor compliance with these guides. In the event of a violation, the FTC could potentially identify a violation of the guides, which could subject us to a financial penalty or loss of endorsers or advertisers. 

In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California's Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.


3


We are also subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of user data. Any failure by us to comply with these privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. In addition, the interpretation of data protection laws, and their application to the Internet is unclear and in a state of flux. There is a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country, or region to region, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect users' privacy and data could result in a loss of confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of customers, which could adversely affect our business.

We generally only receive user data authorized through the Facebook user API. Access to such information, in addition to being limited in scope by Facebook policies and procedures, requires the affirmative authorization of the participating user, as stipulated by Facebook. In a campaign, we post a privacy policy and user agreement, which describe the practices concerning the use, transmission and disclosure of member data in connection with such campaign. Any failure by us to comply with our privacy policy and user agreement could result in proceedings against us by users, customers, governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business.

Many states have passed laws requiring notification to subscribers when there is a security breach of personal data. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the United States Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection. We partner with providers of data to acquire this data and we do not own this data. In addition, data protection laws in Europe and other jurisdictions outside the United States may be more restrictive, and the interpretation and application of these laws are still uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for linking to third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.

Our users communicate across social and/or web-based channels. These communications are governed by a variety of U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. In the United States, the CAN-SPAM Act establishes certain requirements for the distribution of "commercial" email messages for the primary purpose of advertising or promoting a commercial product, service, or Internet website and provides for penalties for transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content or that do not give opt-out control to the recipient. The FTC is primarily responsible for enforcing the CAN-SPAM Act, and the U.S. Department of Justice, other federal agencies, state attorneys general, and Internet service providers also have authority to enforce certain of its provisions.

The CAN-SPAM Act's main provisions include:


· | prohibiting false or misleading email header information; 
· | prohibiting the use of deceptive subject lines; 
· | ensuring that recipients may, for at least 30 days after an email is sent, opt out of receiving future commercial email messages from the sender, with the opt-out effective within 10 days of the request;
· | requiring that commercial email be identified as a solicitation or advertisement unless the recipient affirmatively assented to receiving the message; and 
· | requiring that the sender include a valid postal address in the email message. 


The CAN-SPAM Act preempts most state restrictions specific to email marketing. However, some states have passed laws regulating commercial email practices that are significantly more punitive and difficult to comply with than the CAN-SPAM Act, particularly Utah and Michigan, which have enacted do-not-email registries listing minors who do not wish to receive unsolicited commercial email that markets certain covered content, such as adult content or content regarding harmful products. Some portions of these state laws may not be preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act.

Violations of the CAN-SPAM Act's provisions can result in criminal and civil penalties, including statutory penalties that can be based in part upon the number of emails sent, with enhanced penalties for commercial email senders who harvest email addresses, use dictionary attack patterns to generate email addresses, and/or relay emails through a network without permission.

With respect to text message campaigns, for example, the CAN-SPAM Act and regulations implemented by the FCC pursuant to the CAN-SPAM Act, and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, also known as the Federal Do-Not-Call law, among other requirements, prohibit companies from sending specified types of commercial text messages unless the recipient has given his or her prior express consent. We, our users and our advertisers may all be subject to various provisions of the CAN-SPAM Act. If we are found to be subject to the CAN-SPAM Act, we may be required to change one or more aspects of the way we operate our business.

If we were found to be in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act, other federal laws, applicable state laws not preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act, or foreign laws regulating the distribution of commercial email, whether as a result of violations by our users or any determination that we are directly subject to and in violation of these requirements, we could be required to pay penalties, which would adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our reputation and our business.

In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees, or infrastructure.

Employees

At March 31, 2018, we had 49 full-time employees. We also contract for the services of an additional approximately 60 individuals from a third-party provider in Mexicali, Mexico. There are no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees. 

Our history

We were originally organized in August 2009 as a California limited liability company under the name Social Reality, LLC, and we converted to a Delaware corporation effective January 1, 2012. Social Reality, LLC began business in May, 2010. Upon the conversion, we changed our name to Social Reality, Inc.

Acquisition of Steel Media

On October 30, 2014, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of Steel Media from Mr. Richard Steel pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated October 30, 2014, by and among our company, Steel Media and Mr. Steel. Additional information on the terms of our acquisition of Steel Media can be found in Note 2 to the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. 
Acquisition of Five Delta

On December 19, 2014, we acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Five Delta pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Share Acquisition and Exchange Agreement dated December 19, 2014 by and among Social Reality, Five Delta and the stockholders of Five Delta. Additional information on the terms of our acquisition of Five Delta can be found in Note 2 to the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. 

Additional information
 
We file annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or the Commission). The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the Commission at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549, on official business days during the hours of 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the Commission at 1-800-SEC-0330.

ITEM 1.A 
RISK FACTORS.

Please consider the following risk factors carefully. If any one or more of the following risks were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and the market price of our securities could decrease significantly. Statements below to the effect that an event could or would harm our business (or have an adverse effect on our business or similar statements) mean that the event could or would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, which in turn could or would have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Although we have organized the risk factors below under headings to make them easier to read, many of the risks we face involve more than one type of risk. Consequently you should read all of the risk factors below carefully before making any decision to acquire or hold our securities.

Any investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Investors should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, and all other information in this Form 10-K and in any reports we file with the SEC after we file this Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase or hold our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business. The occurrence of any of the risks described in this Form 10-K could harm our business. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties, and investors may lose part or all of their investment.

Risks Related to our Business

We have a history of losses and there are no assurances we will report profitable operations in the foreseeable future.

We reported net losses of $6,658,882 and $4,248,233 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. At December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $21,148,706. Our future success depends upon our ability to continue to grow our revenues, contain our operating expenses and generate profits. We do not have any long-term agreements with our customers. There are no assurances that we will be able to increase our revenues and cash flow to a level which supports profitable operations. In addition, our operating expenses increased 3.2% in 2017 from 2016. As described elsewhere herein, in 2017 we made certain changes in our operations to limit growth of operating expenses and focus our resources in areas of our operations which we believe have the greatest potential to increase our revenues. We may continue to incur losses in future periods until such time, if ever, as we are successful in significantly increasing our revenues and cash flow beyond what is necessary to fund our ongoing operations and pay our obligations as they become due. If we are able to significantly increase our revenues in future periods, the rapid growth which we are pursuing will strain our organization and we may encounter difficulties in maintaining the quality of our operations. If we are not able to grow successfully, it is unlikely we will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to pay our operating expenses and service our debt obligations, or report profitable operations in future periods.

Our independent registered public accounting firm has substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern.

At December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $21,148,706. Primarily as a result of our recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows and our accumulated deficit, our independent registered public accounting firm has included in its report for the year ended December 31, 2017, an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon, among other factors, our ability to obtain sufficient financing to support our operations.

Our operations rely on various third party vendors and if we lose these vendors it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. 

We rely on third party vendors to provide us with media inventory to facilitate sales of advertising, the majority of which are engaged on a per order basis. Due to our lack of working capital, we are delinquent on payments to several of these media suppliers. While we will attempt to negotiate payment terms and forbearance agreements with these vendors on a case by case basis, many of these vendors may cease providing services to our company and may seek legal remedies against us. Any loss of these vendors or ligation arising out of our failure to satisfy our obligations to any of these vendors could disrupt our business and have a material negative effect on our operations.


6


Our success depends upon our ability to maintain our technology platforms and expand our product offerings. We do not have any long-term contracts with our customers.

We derive our revenue from the core elements of our business which includes the SRAXmd platform. The SRAXmd platform is a highly-specialized ad targeting and data platform specifically geared toward healthcare brands, agencies and medical content publishers and relies on a limited number of customers. The loss of any one customer that uses the SRAXmd platform could adversely impact the results of operations and cash flows in future periods from this platform.

Our success is dependent upon our ability to effectively expand and manage our relationships with our publishers. We do not have any long-term contracts with our publishing partners.

We do not generate our own media inventory. Accordingly, we are dependent upon our publishing partners to provide the media which we sell. We depend on these publishers to make their respective media inventories available to us to use in connection with our campaigns that we manage, create or market. We are not a party to any long-term agreements with any of our publishing partners and there are no assurances we will have continued access to the media. Our growth depends, in part, on our ability to expand and maintain our publisher relationships within our network and to have access to new sources of media inventory such as new partner websites and Facebook pages that offer attractive demographics, innovative and quality content and growing Web user traffic volume. Our ability to attract new publishers to our networks and to retain Web publishers currently in our networks will depend on various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to introduce new and innovative products and services, our pricing policies, and the cost-efficiency to Web publishers of outsourcing their advertising sales. In addition, the number of competing intermediaries that purchase media inventory from Web publishers continues to increase. In the event we are not able to maintain effective relationships with our publishers, our ability to distribute our advertising campaigns will be greatly hindered which will reduce the value of our services and adversely impact our results of operations in future periods.

If we were to lose access to the Facebook platform, our SRAX Social growth would be limited and we could lose our existing revenue from these sources.

Facebook currently provides access to companies to build applications on their platform. We have built our SRAX Social platform to use the Facebook application programming interface, or APIs. The loss of access to the Facebook platform would limit our ability to effectively grow a portion of our operations. We are subject to Facebook's standard terms and conditions for application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation of applications on the Facebook platform. Facebook reserves the right to change these terms and conditions at any time. Our business would be harmed if Facebook:


· | discontinues or limits access to its platform by us and other application developers; 
· | modifies its terms of service or other policies, including fees charged to, or other restrictions on, us or other application developers, or changes how the personal information of its users is made available to application developers on the Facebook platform or shared by users;
· | establishes more favorable relationships with one or more of our competitors; or 
· | develops its own competitive offerings. 


We have benefited from Facebook's strong brand recognition and large user base. Facebook has broad discretion to change its terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers, and any changes to those terms of service may be unfavorable to us. Facebook may also change its fee structure, add fees associated with access to and use of the Facebook platform, change how the personal information of its users is made available to application developers on the Facebook platform or restrict how Facebook users can share information with friends on their platform. In the event Facebook makes any changes in the future, we may have to modify the structure of our campaigns which could impact the effectiveness of our campaigns and adversely impact our results of operations in future periods. 


7


If we lose access to RTB inventory buyers our business may suffer.

In an effort to reduce our dependency on any one provider of advertising demand, we created a platform that utilizes feeds from a number of demand sources for our inventory. We believe that our proprietary technology assists us in aggregating this demand, as well as providing the tools needed by our publishing partners to evaluate and track the effectiveness of the demand that we are aggregating for them. In the event that we lose access to a majority of this demand, however, our revenues would be impacted and our results of operations would be materially adversely impacted until such time, if ever, as we could secure alternative sources of demand for our inventory.

We depend on the services of our executive officers and the loss of any of their services could harm our ability to operate our business in future periods

Our success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers, including Christopher Miglino, Kristoffer Nelson and Joseph Hannan. We are a party to an employment agreement with each of Mr. Miglino, and Mr. Hannan, and an "at will" agreement with Mr. Nelson. Although we do not expect to lose their services in the foreseeable future, the loss of any of them could materially harm our business and operations in future periods until such time as we were able to engage a suitable replacement.

If advertising on the Internet loses its appeal, our revenue could decline.

Our business model may not continue to be effective in the future for a number of reasons, including:


· | a decline in the rates that we can charge for advertising and promotional activities; 
· | our inability to create applications for our customers; 
· | Internet advertisements and promotions are, by their nature, limited in content relative to other media; 
· | companies may be reluctant or slow to adopt online advertising and promotional activities that replace, limit or compete with their existing direct marketing efforts;
· | companies may prefer other forms of Internet advertising and promotions that we do not offer; 
· | the quality or placement of transactions, including the risk of non-screened, non-human inventory and traffic, could cause a loss in customers or revenue; and 
· | regulatory actions may negatively impact our business practices. 


If the number of companies who purchase online advertising and promotional services from us does not grow, we may experience difficulty in attracting publishers, and our revenue could decline.

Additional acquisitions may disrupt our business and adversely affect results of operations.

We may pursue acquisitions in an effort to increase revenue, expand our market position, add to our technological capabilities, or for other purposes. However, any future acquisitions would likely involve risk, including the following:


· | the identification, acquisition and integration of acquired businesses requires substantial attention from management. The diversion of management's attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition process could hurt our business;
· | the anticipated benefits from an acquisition may not be achieved, we may be unable to realize expected synergies from an acquisition or we may experience negative culture effects arising from the integration of new personnel; 
· | difficulties in integrating the technologies, solutions, operations, and existing contracts of the acquired business; 
· | we may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company, technology, or solution; 

 
8




· | to pay for future acquisitions, we could issue additional shares of our Class A common stock or pay cash, raised through equity sales or debt issuance. The issuance of any additional shares of our Class A common stock would dilute the interests of our current stockholders, and debt transactions would result in increased fixed obligations and would likely include covenants and restrictions that would impair our ability to manage our operations; and
· | new business acquisitions can generate significant intangible assets that result in substantial related amortization charges and possible impairments. 


While our general growth strategy includes identifying and closing additional acquisitions, we are not presently a party of any agreements or understandings. There are no assurances we will acquire any additional companies.

Failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price.

We have previously provided, and may provide in the future, public guidance on our expected financial results for future periods. Although we believe that this guidance provides investors with a better understanding of management's expectations for the future and is useful to our stockholders and potential stockholders, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may not always be in line with or exceed the guidance we have provided. For example, we did not meet our 2016 revenue guidance. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our Class A common stock may decline.

Risks Related to Ownership of our Securities

We do not know whether an active, liquid and orderly trading market will develop for our offered securities or what the market price of our offered securities will be and as a result it may be difficult for you to sell your shares of our Class A common stock. 

Prior to October 13, 2016 our Class A common stock was quoted on the OTCQB Tier of the OTC Markets and it was thinly traded. On October 13, 2016, our Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market and since that date a trading marketing in our stock has been developing. While an active trading market in our Class A common stock has developed since that time, it may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of your shares. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our Class A common stock and may impair our ability to enter into collaborations or acquire companies or products by using our shares of Class A common stock as consideration. The market price of our offered securities may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 

The trading price of the shares of our Class A common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus, these factors include: 


· | the success of competitive products; 
· | actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors; 
· | announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;
· | regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries; 
· | the recruitment or departure of key personnel; 
· | the level of expenses; 
· | actual or anticipated changes in estimates to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts; 

 
9




· | variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;
· | fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us; 
· | inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares; 
· | announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts; 
· | sales of our Class A common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders; 
· | additional issuances of securities upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants; 
· | market conditions in the technology sectors; and 
· | general economic, industry and market conditions. 


In addition, the stock market in general, and advertising technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of these risks could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of the shares of our Class A common stock. 

We may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention. 

The market price of the shares of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. To the extent that any claims or suits are brought against us and successfully concluded, we could be materially adversely affected, jeopardizing our ability to operate successfully. Furthermore, our human and capital resources could be adversely affected by the need to defend any such actions, even if we are ultimately successful in our defense. 

Failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price.

We have previously provided, and may provide in the future, public guidance on our expected financial results for future periods. Although we believe that this guidance provides investors with a better understanding of management's expectations for the future and is useful to our stockholders and potential stockholders, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may not always be in line with or exceed the guidance we have provided. For example, we did not meet our 2016 or 2017 revenue guidance. If our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our Class A common stock may decline.

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock.

As described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, our management has determined that, as of December 31, 2016, we did not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework as a result of identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2017, management has determined that we have yet to fully remediate the previously identified material weaknesses. While we have never been required to restate our consolidated financial statements, the existence of the continuing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting increases the risk that a future restatement of our consolidated financial statements is possible.

Delaware law contains anti-takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts that could be beneficial to our stockholders.

Provisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may make the acquisition of our company and the removal of incumbent officers and directors more difficult by prohibiting stockholders holding 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from acquiring us, without our board of directors' consent, for at least three years from the date they first hold 15% or more of the voting stock.

The two class structure of our Class A common stock could have the effect of concentrating voting control with a limited group.

Our authorized capital includes two classes of common stock which have different voting rights. Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. The shares of our Class B common stock were originally held by two of our executive officers who were the founders of our company, but these shares were converted into shares of our Class A common stock in October 2013. While there are presently no shares of Class B common stock outstanding, in the future our board could choose to issue shares to one or more individuals or entities. As a result of the voting rights associated with the Class B common stock, those individuals or entities could have significant influence over the management and affairs of the company and control over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets, for the foreseeable future. This concentrated voting control could limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could adversely affect the price of our Class A common stock.

If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the trading price of our Class A common stock and trading volume could decline. 

The trading market for our shares of our Class A common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. A small number of securities and industry analysts currently publish research regarding our Company on a limited basis. In the event that one or more of the securities or industry analysts who have initiated coverage downgrade our securities or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our shares of Class A common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the trading price of our shares of Class A common stock and trading volume to decline. 

The elimination of monetary liability against our directors and officers under Delaware law and the existence of indemnification rights held by our directors and officers may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors and officers.

Our certificate of incorporation eliminates the personal liability of our directors and officers to our company and our stockholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer to the extent permissible under Delaware law. Further, our bylaws provide that we are obligated to indemnify any of our directors or officers to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law. We are also parties to separate indemnification agreements with certain of our directors and our officers which, subject to certain conditions, require us to advance the expenses incurred by any director or officer in defending any action, suit or proceeding prior to its final disposition. Those indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against our directors or officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against any of our current or former directors or officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even if such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit us or our stockholders.

Risks Related to the BIG Platform and BIGToken Project

There can be no assurance that BIGTokens will ever be issued.
 
The Company recently announced its intent to develop the BIG Platform as a means of securing higher quality user data. The Company anticipates that a material part of the platform will be the issuance of BIGTokens to users. There can be no assurance that it will do so. Should the Company fail to issue the BIGTokens, the attractiveness of the BIG Platform may be materially affected and we will not recognize the benefits of the project.

There is currently no trading market for BIGTokens, and a trading market may never develop.
 
If the BIGTokens are ultimately issued, there is currently no trading market available for the BIGTokens, no Designated Exchange and peer-to-peer transfers will not be permitted unless and until holders are notified otherwise by the Company and informed of the requirements to and conditions do so. As a result of recent regulatory developments, conventional crypto exchanges are currently unwilling to list securities tokens, such as the proposed BIGTokens.  As a result, if and when issued and they become transferable, BIGTokens may only be tradable on very limited range of venues, including U.S. registered exchanges or regulated alternative trading systems for which a Form ATS has been properly submitted to the SEC.  Currently, the Company is unaware of any operational ATS or exchange capable of supporting secondary trading in BIGTokens, when issued. Additionally, even if the BIGTokens are issued and become transferable, we may rely on technology, including smart contracts, to implement certain restrictions on transferability in accordance with the federal securities laws.  There can be no assurance that such technology will function properly, which could result in technological limitations on transferability and expose the Company to legal and regulatory issues. As a result of these technological, legal and regulatory considerations, a market for the BIGToken may never be developed and, if developed, may, for a variety of technological, legal and regulatory reasons, never become operational or efficient.  In the event that a market for the BIGToken does not develop, the value of the BIGTokens would be materially adversely affected which could also have a materially adverse affect on our BIG Platform and the anticipated benefits therefrom.

Regulatory authorities may never permit a trading system on which the BIGToken could trade to become operational.
 
Numerous regulatory authorities, including FINRA and the SEC, would need to permit the a trading system on which the BIGToken could trade to become operational.  If FINRA, the SEC or any other regulatory authority objected to such system or exchange, such regulatory authorities could prevent the system or exchange from ever becoming operational.  Any such regulatory issues would have a material adverse impact on our BIG Platform project.

The potential application of U.S. laws regarding investment securities to the tokens is unclear.
 
Securities, such as the BIGToken are novel and the application of U.S. federal and state securities laws is unclear in many respects. Because of the differences between the securities such as the BIGToken and traditional investment securities, there is a risk that issues that might easily be resolved by existing law if traditional securities were involved may not be easily resolved for securities such as the BIGToken. In addition, because of the novel risks posed by securities such as the BIGToken, it is possible that securities regulators may interpret laws in a manner that adversely affects their value.  For example, if applicable securities laws restrict the ability for BIGTokens to be transferred, this would have a material adverse effect on the value of the BIGToken, which could result in a material impact on the BIG Platform project. 

The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and offerings of digital assets, such as the BIGToken, is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development and the value of the BIG Platform.
 
Regulation of digital assets, like the anticipated BIGTokens, cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies and cryptocurrency exchanges, is currently undeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve as government agencies take greater interest in them, varies significantly among international, federal, state and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty.  Various legislative and executive bodies in the United States and in other countries may in the future adopt laws, regulations, or guidance, or take other actions, which may severely impact the permissibility of securities such as the BIGToken, tokens generally and, in each case, the technology behind them or the means of transaction in or transferring them.  Our failure to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or that are subject to interpretations that may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines.
 
Cryptocurrency networks, distributed ledger technologies, and coin and token offerings also face an uncertain regulatory landscape in many foreign jurisdictions such as the European Union, China and Russia.  Various foreign jurisdictions may, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect securities such as the proposed BIGToken.  Such laws, regulations or directives may conflict with those of the United States or may directly and negatively impact our BIG Platform.  The effect of any future regulatory change is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and materially adverse to the adoption and value of the BIGTokens, when and if issued, and the financial performance of our BIG Platform when and if developed.

The further development and acceptance of blockchain networks, which are part of a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate.  The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of blockchain networks and blockchain assets would have an adverse material effect on the successful development and adoption of BIGTokens.
 
The growth of the blockchain industry in general, as well as the blockchain networks on which the BIG Platform and BIGTokens will rely, are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.  The factors affecting the further development of the cryptocurrency and cryptosecurity industry, as well as blockchain networks, include, without limitation:
 
·
 worldwide growth in the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies, cryptosecurities and other blockchain technologies;

·
 government and quasi-government regulation of cryptocurrencies, cryptosecurities and other blockchain assets and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of blockchain networks or similar systems;

·
 the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of cryptocurrency or cryptosecurities networks;

·
 changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;

·
 the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, or trading assets including new means of using government-backed currencies or existing networks;

·
 general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to cryptocurrencies and cryptosecurities; and

·
 a decline in the popularity or acceptance of cryptocurrencies or other blockchain-based tokens would adversely affect the BIGToken, when and if issued, and have a materially adverse affect on the BIG Platform.
 
The cryptocurrency and cryptosecurities industries as a whole have been characterized by rapid changes and innovations and are constantly evolving.  Although they have experienced significant growth in recent years, the slowing or stopping of the development, general acceptance and adoption and usage of blockchain networks and blockchain assets may deter or delay the acceptance and adoption of the Tokens.
