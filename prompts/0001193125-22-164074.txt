 The Company’s manufacturing and distribution facilities are located in Kentucky and Florida. 
 The Company continues to explore opportunities to expand its product offerings in the display industry. The Company anticipates that this expansion will be achieved by adding new products or by acquiring existing companies that would enhance the Company’s position in the display industry. Management continually evaluates product trends externally in the industry and internally in the divisions in which the Company operates. 
Segment Information 
 We operate and manage our business as one segment. The four divisions have similarities such as the types of products and markets served. Therefore, we believe they meet the criteria for aggregation under the applicable authoritative guidance and, as such, are reported as one segment within the Consolidated Financial Statements.

  These product lines are used by the military branches such as the Navy and Air Force and various government agencies such as the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy. VDC also supplies direct view video walls into both the Command and Control and Broadcast markets 
 This portion of the Company’s operations, which contributed approximately 58% of fiscal 2022 consolidated net sales, involves the design, engineering, and manufacturing of digital projector display units. The Company customizes these units for specific applications, including ruggedization for military uses or size reduction due to space limitations in industrial and medical applications. Because of the Company’s flexible and cost efficient manufacturing, it is able to handle low volume orders that generate higher margins. 
 This portion of the Company’s operations targets niche markets where competition from major multinational electronics companies tends to be lower. The prime customers for these products include defense, security, training, and simulation areas of the United States of America (U.S.) and foreign militaries as well as the major defense contractors such as the Boeing Company, L-3 Communications Corporation, DRS Laurel Technologies, and others. Flight simulator displays are produced to provide a full range of flight training simulations for military and commercial applications. 
 Cyber Secure Products 
 The Company acquired the AYON Cyber Security (“ACS”) division in March 2012. ACS was formerly known as Hetra Products and most recently as StingRay56 before becoming part of Video Display Corporation. ACS specializes in advanced TEMPEST technology, also known as Emanation Security (EMSEC), products and custom engineering solutions to include extreme environmental performance and survivability technologies (MIL-STD-810 and DO-160) in support of military forces, intelligence agencies, prime contractors and niche commercial sectors worldwide. ACS has a long history of specializing in TEMPEST technology. In addition to its TEMPEST products and services, the business also provides various contract services to government agencies and prime contractors. Services performed include design and testing solutions for defense and niche commercial uses worldwide. This division represented approximately 9% of fiscal 2022 consolidated net sales. 
 CRTs and Phosphor Products 
 Since its organization in 1975, the Company has been engaged in the distribution and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) using new and recycled CRT glass bulbs, primarily in the replacement market, for use in data display screens, including computer terminal monitors, medical monitor equipment and various other data display applications and in television sets. 
 The Company’s CRT manufacturing operation of new and recycled CRTs is conducted at a facility located in Lexington, Kentucky (Lexel). The Company offers CRTs from other manufacturers at this facility as well. This division represented approximately 14% of fiscal 2022 consolidated net sales. 
 The Company maintains the capability of manufacturing and remanufacturing monochrome CRTs for Flight Simulators and Medical Monitors. In addition, our Lexel operation manufactures highly specialized CRTs called a Direct-View Storage Tubes (DVSTs) for military radar applications. All CRTs manufactured by the Company pass rigorous testing and quality requirements. The Medical Monitors are tested in accordance with standards from Underwriters Laboratories. Major customers for our CRT products include GE Healthcare, Leonardo DRS, Richardson Electronics, Flight Safety and many more. 
 The Company also distributes new CRTs and other electronic tubes purchased from OEMs. The Company sells CRTs into the replacement market which sometimes takes five to seven years to develop; these purchased inventories sometimes do not sell as quickly as other inventories. Bulk CRT purchases have declined over the past few years as the Company is managing current inventory levels against the anticipated reduction in future CRT demand due to the growth of flat panel technology. 
 The Company’s Lexel operation also provides a wide variety of products for the scientific community in the way of phosphor coated substrates. This is an area of potential growth for the Company as advances in the scientific community are made and the demand for phosphor coated substrates increase worldwide. These products are used in many applications including CCD imaging, RHEED/LEED view ports, Digital X-Ray Imaging, Electron Microscopy, Alpha detectors for Neutron generators, and Spectrometry to name a few. Some of our major customers for these products include Bruker, Photonis, and all the US National Laboratories.

  Other Computer Products 
 The Company acquired a small keyboard company on October 23, 2017. The Company long term plans are to use this as a platform to manufacture cyber-secure keyboards as part of the cyber security division. This division was 19% of the 2022 consolidated net sales. 
Patents and Trademarks 
 The Company holds patents with respect to certain products and services. The Company also sells products under various trademarks and trade names. The Company believes that success in its industry primarily will be dependent upon incorporating emerging technology into new product line introductions, frequent product enhancements, and customer support and service. 
Seasonal Variations in Business 
 Historically, there has not been seasonal variability in the Company’s business. 
 Working Capital Practices 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has sustained losses for three of the last five years. The accumulated losses reported has resulted from a combination of lower revenues at certain divisions without a commensurate reduction of expenses. The Company’s working capital and liquid asset position is presented as follows: 

 | February 28,2022 | | February 28,2021 | 
Working capital | $ | 509 | | $ | 3,601
Liquid assets | $ | 245 | | $ | 293 


Management’s plans with regard to improving working capital includes increasing marketing efforts in its ruggedized displays, TEMPEST services and small specialty displays. The Company is developing new products for customers in the TEMPEST sector of its business. Also, the Company has expanded its cyber security business by adding a second testing chamber and a new testing machine for testing tempest products. The Company is aggressively seeking new business for this sector of its business and just completed and had accredited its new AIS system allowing it to increase the business in cyber testing services to supplement the product side of the business. 
 The Company has streamlined its operations and is focusing on increasing revenues by executing initiatives such as upgrading its sales and marketing efforts including a more user friendly website to market all the product lines it sells and email blasts to targeted customers with specific product lines. These efforts have not increased revenues to date as the Company’s business typically has longer lead times from initial contact to a sale. The pandemic has also slowed down the process of obtaining new business as many of our customers and potential customers are still working from home. Furthermore, supply chain challenges have slowed down production of certain products due to long lead times on critical items of production, impacting cash flow. 
 The Company moved the corporate accounting functions to the Cocoa, Florida location which allows the Company to become more efficient and save money on reducing redundant operations. The Company has not automatically replaced employees who have left the Company while it works to increase business. The Company reduced expenses further by closing the Tucker, Georgia facility on March 31, 2022. 
 If additional and more permanent capital is required to fund the operations of the Company, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to obtain the capital on terms favorable to the Company, if at all.
