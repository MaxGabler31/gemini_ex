 We distribute human tissue, bovine and porcine animal tissue, metal and synthetic implants through various distribution channels. We operate in one reportable segment composed of four lines of business. Effective January 1, 2018, the reporting of our lines of business is composed of four franchises or lines of business: spine; sports; OEM and international. Our previous lines of business were composed of: spine; sports medicine and orthopedics; surgical specialties; cardiothoracic; international; and OEM. Additionally, effective January 1, 2018, the other revenues category is included in the OEM line of business. The prior year comparable revenue information has been restated to conform to the current year presentation. We believe that the change in the reporting of our lines of business is aligned with our focused strategy of reducing complexity and better understanding of our lines of business. Discrete financial information is not available for these four lines of business. The following table presents revenues from these four franchises and their

 Corporate Information 
 We were incorporated in 1997 in Florida as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the University of Florida Tissue Bank, (UFTB). We began operations on February 12, 1998 when UFTB contributed to us its allograft processing operations, related equipment and technologies, distribution arrangements, research and development activities and certain other assets. At the time of our initial public offering in August 2000, we reincorporated in the State of Delaware. In July 2013, we completed our acquisition of Pioneer Surgical Technology, Inc. (Pioneer) and, in connection with the acquisition, changed our name from RTI Biologics, Inc. to RTI Surgical, Inc. In August 2017, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets related to our Cardiothoracic closure business (the CT Business) to A&E Advanced Closure Systems, LLC (a subsidiary of A&E Medical Corporation) (A&E). On January 4, 2018, we acquired Zyga Technology, Inc. (Zyga) through the merger of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries with and into Zyga. On November 1, 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Paradigm Spine, LLC (Paradigm) in a cash and stock transaction. Our principal offices are located at 11621 Research Circle, Alachua, Florida, and our phone number is (386) 418-8888.Industry Overview 
 Defects in bone and other human tissue can be caused by a variety of sources including trauma, congenital defects, aging, revision of joint replacements, infectious disease, cancer and other similar conditions. The predominant method used to repair injured or defective bone and tissue is surgical intervention, primarily through the use of surgical implants. When considering a surgical procedure for bone or tissue repair, surgeons and patients have a number of treatment options including: 

 | metals and synthetics;
--+-----------------------


 | xenograft tissue from an animal source;
--+------------------------------------------


 | autograft tissue from the patient; and
--+-----------------------------------------


 | allograft tissue from another human donor.
--+---------------------------------------------

 Depending on the specific surgery, surgeons may elect to use any number of these treatment options. We offer a broad line of metal, synthetic, xenograft and allograft solutions to meet their needs. 
 Metals and Synthetics 
 The medical community has used metal and synthetic materials for implant procedures for many years. Metal and synthetic technologies are used to create both surgical implants as well as instruments used in surgical procedures. These implants are used in a variety of procedures in spine, cardiothoracic, trauma and other areas. Typical metals used include surgical stainless steel and titanium. These materials are chosen for their strength and durability. Synthetic implants provide alternative implant options for surgeons and reliable availability due to the variable supply of xenograft, autograft and allograft. One common example of a synthetic material is polyetheretherketone (PEEK). A recent trend has emerged for advanced materials in spinal interbodies. RTI Surgical has a position in that space through its Fortilink family of products, which is produced by additive manufacturing (3-D printing) using a proprietary polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) material called TETRAfuse® 3-D. The Companys exclusive supplier of TETRAfuse® 3-D is Oxford Performance Materials, Inc.

 Xenograft Tissue 
 Xenograft tissue-based implants are common in many areas of medicine including cardiac and vascular procedures, soft tissue repair and wound care. Xenograft based implants are also used in the repair of bone defects in orthopedic surgery as carriers for demineralized bone matrix and bone morphogenic protein products. The production of xenograft implants involves recovering animal tissue, typically from cattle (bovine) or pigs (porcine), processing and sterilization, and then transplanting the xenograft implant into a human patient. 
Autograft and Allograft Tissue 
 Many surgeons use autograft and allograft tissue in their surgical procedures to take advantage of their natural characteristics. Autograft procedures involve a surgeon harvesting tissue from one part of a patients body for transplant to another part of the body. Allograft tissues are recovered from cadaveric donors, processed for certain intended uses and then transplanted by a surgeon into the patients body to make the needed repair. 
 Autograft and allograft bone implants are not only osteoconductive, meaning they provide a scaffold for new bone to attach itself to, but can be osteoinductive as well, meaning they stimulate the growth of new tissue. 
 Marketing and Distribution 
 We market and distribute our implants through direct distribution channels and a combination of both exclusive and non-exclusive OEM distributors depending upon the product category. Our implants are used in the following markets: spine, sports medicine, orthobiologics, trauma, dental, plastic surgery and other surgical specialties. Our implants range from metals, synthetics, allografts and xenografts that are precision machined for specific surgical applications, to grafts conventionally processed for general surgical uses. 
Direct Channels 
 Spine 
 The human spine consists of four regions: cervical (neck region), thoracic (back region attached to the ribs), lumbar (lower back), and sacral (tail bone). We design, manufacture, and distribute surgical implants, instruments, and biologics used in the treatment of conditions affecting the spine caused by degenerative conditions, deformities or traumatic injury. Our principal implant offering includes a wide variety of systems composed of components such as spine screws and rods, spinal spacers, plates, and various biologics offerings all designed to support, enhance, or promote spinal fusion. Our principal implant offerings by market segment are as follows: 

 | Thoracolumbar: Streamline® TL Spinal Fixation System, Quantum® Spinal Fixation System, Streamline® MIS Spinal Fixation System, MIS FusionTM Instrumentation, Contact® Anterior Lumbar Plate System
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Cervical: Streamline® Posterior Cervical Spinal Fixation System, Slimfuse® Anterior Cervical Plate System, Aspect® Anterior Cervical Plate System
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Lateral: Clarity® Retractor System, Lat-FuseTM Lateral Plate System
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Interbody: C PlusTM PEEK IBF System, BulletTM PEEK IBF System, Cross-Fuse II® PEEK VBR/IBF System
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Biologics: The BioSet® DBM, BioReady® DBM, and BioAdapt® DBM families of paste implants
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Synthetics: nanOss® advanced bone graft substitute
--+---------------------------------------------------

Sports 
 Many repetitive use and sports-related injuries can be addressed with allograft implants. The most prevalent surgeries in the knee include repairs to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), articular cartilage repair, and meniscus transplantation. The most prevalent surgeries in the shoulder include rotator cuff repair and articular cartilage repair. Our principal sports medicine allografts are tendons for ligament reconstruction, fresh osteochondral grafts for cartilage repair, and our meniscal allografts for advanced meniscus injuries. Many of our sports medicine tendon allografts utilize our patented pre-shaped technology, which greatly reduces preparation time in the operating room and are generally easier to implant than non pre-shaped allografts. We also distribute Matrix HD human dermis implants for wound repair and soft tissue augmentation and map3® cellular allogeneic bone graft for foot and ankle repair. We also market and distribute implants for abdominal wall repair, and plastic and reconstructive surgery. These implants are processed through our validated Tutoplast tissue sterilization process, which has a proven track record of safety and performance. Principal products include Cortiva human dermis, Fortiva porcine dermis and 
 
3 


  Tutopatch and Tutomesh bovine pericardium. 
 OEM Channels 
 We also market and distribute our implants through relationships with OEM distributors. 
 Our spine interbody allograft implants are marketed and distributed domestically through our non-exclusive relationships with Aesculap Implant Systems, Inc. (Aesculap), Integra Life Sciences Corporation (Integra), Medtronic, PLC (Medtronic), Orthofix International NV (Orthofix), Stryker Spine, a division of Stryker Corporation (Stryker), and Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (Zimmer). 
 Our allograft paste implants are marketed and distributed under Puros® DBM by Zimmer and BIO DBM by Stryker. 
 Our surgical specialty implants are marketed and distributed through distributors including: Integra for dural repair applications; Davol, Inc., a subsidiary of C. R. Bard, Inc. (Davol) for hernia repair and breast reconstruction; Katena Products, Inc. (Katena) for ophthalmology and Coloplast A/S of Denmark (Coloplast) for urology. 
 Our allograft dental implants including cancellous and cortical bone and human and bovine membranes primarily for dental procedures related to augmenting ridge restoration are distributed exclusively by Zimmer. 
 Our trauma implants are distributed through Zimmer and DePuy Synthes (Synthes), a Johnson & Johnson Inc. subsidiary. Zimmer across all implants represents approximately 21% of our total revenues. 
 Effective August 3, 2017, our cardiothoracic hardware implants are distributed through A&E. 
 International 
 Internationally we market and distribute our implants through a direct distribution organization and a network of independent distributors. 
 Cardiothoracic 
 On August 3, 2017, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets related to our CT Business to A&E. We now serve as an OEM to A&E, who provides surgeons cardiothoracic cable and plating systems. The Company retained all rights to its Cardiothoracic biologic implant. Cardiothoracic hardware implants offer increased stability and rigidity for sternal closures, ranging from routine closures to complex, high-risk closures. The cardiothoracic biologic implant reinforces soft tissue where weakness exists in general, as well as for repair of pericardial structures. 
 The BIOCLEANSE® Tissue Sterilization Process 
 We have developed and utilized in the United States the patented BIOCLEANSE® tissue sterilization process, which is an automated, pharmaceutical grade chemical sterilization process for musculoskeletal bone and certain soft tissue. This process is fully validated to kill or inactivate all classes of conventional pathogens, viruses, microbes, bacteria and fungi. Our BIOCLEANSE® process is able to remove greater than 99% of the blood, fats, lipids and other unwanted materials from the tissue we process. An important element of the BIOCLEANSE® process is that while it removes unwanted materials embedded within the tissue, it maintains the tissues structural integrity and compression strength. Studies have shown that bone tissue sterilized with the BIOCLEANSE® process maintains the same compression strength as untreated tissue. 
 The BIOCLEANSE® process has been reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which concluded that BIOCLEANSE® was a validated tissue sterilization process demonstrated to prevent contamination of tissue grafts. To our knowledge, no other tissue sterilization process related to human tissue in our industry has been reviewed or approved by the FDA. It should be noted that the FDA does not have a formal approval process in place for tissue related processing techniques. 
 Two types of preserved allografts are processed using the BIOCLEANSE® process: soft tissue, consisting of tendons and cartilage; and bone tissue, consisting of various configurations of cancellous and cortical bone material. Tendons and cartilage are used to repair/replace native tissue primarily in sports medicine reconstructive surgeries. Processed cortical and cancellous bone materials are used in a wide variety of applications in spine and orthopedic surgeries.

 The TUTOPLAST® Tissue Sterilization Process 
 The TUTOPLAST® tissue sterilization process utilizes solvent dehydration and chemical inactivation to remove blood, lipids and extraneous materials, and inactivate viruses and break down RNA and DNA into fragments not capable of replication and disease transmission while preserving the biological and mechanical properties. 
 Two types of preserved allografts are processed using the TUTOPLAST® process: soft tissue, consisting of fascia lata, pericardium, dermis, sclera and cornea; and bone tissue, consisting of various configurations of cancellous and cortical bone material. Processed pericardium, fascia lata and dermis are collagenous tissue used to repair, replace or line native connective tissue primarily in dental, ophthalmology, urology, plastic and reconstructive surgeries. Dermis is also used in hernia repair and pelvic floor reconstruction. Sclera and cornea are used in ophthalmology procedures such as anterior and posterior segment patch grafting applications for glaucoma, retina and trauma surgery and oculoplastics, as well as contour wrapping of an orbital implant. Processed cortical and cancellous bone material is used in a wide variety of applications in spine, orthopedic and dental surgeries. 
 The CANCELLE® SP DBM Sterilization Process 
 DBM-based pastes and putties are sterilized through the CANCELLE® SP process, which is designed to preserve protein activity. In their final form, the DBM implants serve as bone void fillers in many applications, including spinal, general orthopedic, joint reconstruction and dental surgeries. 
 CANCELLE® SP is a proprietary process that sterilizes DBM pastes and putties while simultaneously allowing them to maintain their osteoinductive (OI) potential, which is verified by 100 percent lot testing after sterilization. The determination of OI potential is made by lot release animal studies or testing for certain protein markers. These tests are not necessarily predictive of human clinical results. Through a combination of oxidative treatments and acid or alcohol washes, debris is removed and pathogens are inactivated. Cleansing rinses remove residual chemicals, maintaining biocompatibility and preserving the utility of the graft. The CANCELLE® SP irradiation dose is delivered terminally for most pastes and putties to achieve device-level sterility (SAL 10-6). 
 Tissue Recovery 
 Tissue recovery is the actual removal of tissue from a donor after legal authorization has been obtained. Authorization is obtained by the tissue recovery group. We contract with independent FDA registered tissue recovery groups that specialize in this activity. Tissue recovery personnel aseptically recover tissue within 24 hours following a donors death, using surgical instruments and sterile techniques similar to those used in hospitals for routine surgery. Recovered tissue is placed on wet or dry ice, then transported by the donor recovery agency to the tissue processor or possibly a research institution. 
 Under U.S. law, human tissue cannot be bought and sold. However, the law permits the recovery of reasonable payments for the provision of certain services, such as those involved in recovering, processing and storing tissue and related to the advancement of tissue processing technologies; all types of activities in which we are involved. 
 Donor recovery groups recover a variety of tissue types from donors including the fibula, femur, tibia, humerus, ilium, pericardium, fascia lata, dermis, costal cartilage, sclera, tendons and ligaments. We believe that our established relationships with recovery organizations are sufficient to meet the ongoing operation demands for the next twelve months. These contracted tissue recovery organizations are responsible for obtaining appropriate authorization and conducting federally-mandated donor screening, such as a donor risk assessment interview (DRAI) with the next of kin. Each donor is evaluated against current acceptance criteria prior to donor tissue being sent to our processing facility. Upon receipt of the tissue, we conduct pre-processing donor screening to determine donor medical suitability for transplantation. Pre-processing screening performed by us includes laboratory testing and a donor medical eligibility assessment. With respect to laboratory testing, we perform an extensive panel of serological and microbiological tests using Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendment (CLIA) approved laboratories and FDA test kits. These results are subject to stringent criteria in order to release the donor tissue to the processing stage. 
 We have relationships with tissue donor recovery agencies across the United States. We also have relationships outside the United States. We believe additional recovery group relationships would be available if needed and consequently that the loss of any one of our sources of donor tissue would not have a material impact on our operating results. 
 We continue to develop new xenograft tissue implants. Implants processed from xenograft tissue are regulated by the 
 
5 


  FDA as devices and require approval or licenses from the FDA prior to marketing in the United States. The sources of our bovine animal tissues are regulated closed herds. We believe that our established relationships with our sources of xenograft animal tissues are sufficient to meet our demands for our ongoing operations for the next twelve months. We believe the continued development of our xenograft implants will help us meet unmet demand for certain allografts and also allow us to develop new biological implants that cannot currently be made due to structural limitations of human tissue. 
 Research and Development 
 Our research and development (R&D) costs for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $14.4 million, $13.4 million and $16.1 million, respectively. In 2018, we continued to invest in our R&D efforts by funding new projects including research and development projects at our facilities in our US locations and in Neunkirchen, Germany. 
 We plan to continue to develop new implants, technologies and surgical techniques within our current markets, and to develop additional technologies for other markets to address unmet clinical needs. We plan to do this by building on our core technology platforms: TETRAfuse® 3-D, BIOCLEANSE®, TUTOPLAST®, CANCELLE® SP, precision machining, assembled grafts, tissue-mediated osteoinduction and our metal and synthetics design and production expertise. We are working to develop differentiated technologies and investing in generating the necessary clinical data to drive demand and support appropriate reimbursement. We operate a dedicated research team working on advanced technologies, and have embedded development/technical teams who work with the business/marketing teams focused on expanding the scope and scale of existing competencies such as tissue machining and sterilization, and metal and synthetics manufacturing to meet specific surgical needs. This approach has resulted in the development of core science platforms, a pipeline of concepts for development and marketing, and focused projects to meet immediate needs. 
 In 2018, we launched 6 new implants and product enhancements in spine, sports, and general orthopedics developed by our research and development teams. January 2018 marked the first clinical use of the Fortilink-TS and Fortilink-L product systems, which were followed by the full commercial launch of the Fortilink-TS system in May 2018. The Fortilink systems are the second and third in a family of devices to incorporate our TETRAfuse 3D Technology. Additionally, 2018 began the manufacture and initial commercial use of the Thorecon sternal closure system in association with our partner A&E. The ViBone biologic product was introduced to the RTI market space through a focused and exclusive partnership with Aziyo Biologics. Enhancements were made to Streamline OCT system, continuing the history of continuously improved features and options; performance improvements were made to our synthetic biologic line with the release of nanOss 3D Plus. 
Intellectual Property 
 Our business depends upon the significant know-how and proprietary technology we have developed. To protect this know-how and proprietary technology, we rely on a combination of trade secret laws, patents, licenses, trademarks and confidentiality agreements. The effect of these intellectual property rights is to define zones of exclusive use of the covered intellectual property. The duration of patent rights generally is 20 years from the date of filing of priority application, while trademarks, once registered, are essentially perpetual. Our trademarks and service marks provide us and our implants with a certain amount of brand recognition in our markets. However, we do not consider any single patent, trademark or service mark material to our business strategy, financial condition or results of operations. We have also entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses relating to a wide array of third-party technologies. In addition, we rely on our substantial body of know-how, including proprietary tissue recovery techniques and processes, research and development, tissue processing and quality assurance. 
 Our proprietary BIOCLEANSE®, TUTOPLAST® and CANCELLE® SP sterilization processes are covered by one or more U.S. and/or foreign patents, patent applications or trade secrets. Other U.S. and foreign holdings include, without limitation, patents, patent applications or trade secrets relating to or covering certain precision machined allograft intervertebral spacers and other spinal implants; matrix compositions including various bone graft substitutes; membrane tissue implants; and ligament, tendon or meniscus reconstruction and repair with certain precision shaped and/or assembled bone and soft tissue implants, synthetic bone graft substitutes; interbody fusion and motion implants; spinal and orthopedic plates; spinal rods, cables and screws and spinal fixation systems and related instrumentation. 
 The medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. As the number of entrants into our market increases, the risk of an infringement claim against us, as well as the risk of a third party infringing on our patents, grows. While we attempt to ensure that our implants and methods do not infringe other parties patents and proprietary rights, our competitors may assert that our implants, and the methods we employ, are covered by patents held by them. In addition, our competitors may assert that future implants and methods we may employ infringe their patents. If third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights, we 
 
6 


  may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling the affected implant. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, involved in litigation relating to our intellectual property. 
 Competition 
 Competition in the medical implant industry is intense and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards. Companies within the industry compete on the basis of design of related instrumentation, efficacy of implants, relationships with the surgical community, depth of range of implants, scientific and clinical results and pricing. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, with much greater resources. 
 Our principal competitors in the conventional allograft market include the Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation (MTF), AlloSource Inc., Community Tissue Services (CTS), LifeLink Tissue Bank (LifeLink), JRF Ortho (JRF), LifeCell, Inc., a subsidiary of Allergan PLC and LifeNet Health, Inc. (LifeNet). Among our competitors in precision machined allograft are MTF, LifeNet and AlloSource. Other companies who process and distribute allograft pastes include Medtronic, AlloSource, Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corp. (Integra), Wright Medical Inc. and MTF. Companies who process and distribute xenograft tissue include Baxter, Inc., LifeCell, Cook Surgical and Medtronic. 
 We consider our principal competitors in the metal and synthetic markets to include Medtronic, Stryker, Zimmer Biomet, Depuy Synthes, Globus Medical Group, Inc. (Globus), K2M Group Holdings Inc. (K2), NuVasive, Inc. (NuVasive), Alphatec Holdings Inc. (Alphatec), Spinal Elements (Spinal), Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc. (Xtant), SeaSpine Holdings Corporation (SeaSpine), and Orthofix International NV (Orthofix). 
  Government Regulation and Corporate Compliance 
 Government Regulation 
 Government regulation plays a significant role in the processing/manufacturing and distribution of allograft tissue implants and medical devices. We procure, where applicable, process/manufacture, and market our allograft tissue implants and medical devices worldwide. Although some standards of harmonization exist, each country in which we do business has its own specific regulatory requirements. These requirements are dynamic in nature and, as such, are continually changing. New regulations may be promulgated at any time and with limited notice. While we believe that we are in material compliance with all existing pertinent international and domestic laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that changes in governmental administrations and regulations, or their interpretation or application, will not adversely affect our operations. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, suspension of production, inability to market current products, criminal prosecution, and/or refusal of the government to authorize the marketing of new products. 
 In the United States, most of our allograft implants are regulated by the FDA solely under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 1270 and 1271, Current Good Tissue Practice for Human Cell, Tissue, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (cGTPs). Xenograft tissues and some of our allograft-containing implants are regulated as medical devices and subject to FDA 21 CFR, Part 820 Current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) for Medical Devices and related statutes from the FDA. In addition, our U.S. operation is subject to certain state and local regulations, as well as compliance to the standards of the tissue bank industrys accrediting organization, the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB). 
 In Germany, allografts are classified as drugs and the German government regulates such implants in accordance with German Drug Law. On April 7, 2004, the European Commission issued a human tissue directive to regulate allografts within the European Union (EU). Our Neunkirchen facility is presently licensed by the German Health Authorities and in compliance with applicable international laws and regulations, allowing us to market our human and animal tissue implants globally. 
 The FDA and international regulatory bodies conduct periodic compliance inspections of both our U.S. and our German processing facilities. All operations are registered with the U.S. FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) for device manufacturing locations and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) for human tissue recovery, processing and distribution locations and are certified to ISO 13485:2003 and transitioning to ISO 13485:2016. The Alachua facility is also accredited by the AATB and is licensed in the states of Florida, New York, California, Maryland, Delaware and Illinois. The Neunkirchen facility is registered with the German Health Authority 
 
7 


  (BfArM) as a pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturer and is subject to German Drug Law. We believe that worldwide regulation of allografts and xenografts is likely to intensify as the international regulatory community focuses on the growing demand for these implants and the attendant safety and efficacy issues of citizen recipients. 
 We currently market and distribute allografts that are subject to the FDAs Human Tissue Intended for Transplantation and Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products regulations. Under these regulations, we are required to perform donor screening and infectious disease testing and to document this screening and testing for each donor from whom we process tissue, and to process tissues in compliance with cGTP. The FDA has authority under the rules to inspect human tissue processing facilities, and to detain, recall, or destroy tissues for which appropriate documentation and evidence of compliance is not available. We are not required to obtain pre-market approval or clearance from the FDA for allografts that meet the regulations definition of human tissue. 
 The FDA may regulate certain allografts as medical devices, drugs, or biologics, which would require that we obtain approval or product licensure from the FDA. This would occur in those cases where the allograft is deemed to have been more than minimally manipulated or indicated for non-homologous use. In general, homologous use occurs when tissue is used for the same basic function that it fulfilled in the donor. The definitional criteria for making these determinations appear in the FDAs rules. If the FDA decides that certain of our current or future allografts are more than minimally manipulated or indicated for non-homologous use, it would require licensure, approval or clearances of those allografts. Allografts requiring such pre-market review are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA. We would be required to list these allografts as a drug, as a medical device, or as a biologic, and to manufacture them in specifically registered or licensed facilities in accordance with FDA regulation Current Good Manufacturing Practices. We would also be subject to post-marketing surveillance and reporting requirements. In addition, our manufacturing facilities and processes would be subject to periodic inspection to assess compliance with cGMPs. Our labeling and promotional activities would be subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain instances, by the Federal Trade Commission. The export of drugs, devices, and biologics is also subject to more intensive regulation than is the case for human tissue implants. 
 Our research, development and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and other countries. Most notably, all of our implants distributed in the United States are subject to the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Services Act as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The regulations that cover our implants and facilities vary widely based on implant type and classification both in the United States, and from country to country. The amount of time required to obtain approvals or clearances from regulatory authorities also differs from country to country. 
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we wish to commercially distribute in the United States will be covered by premarket notification (510(k)) clearance from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II, with the Class II devices typically requiring the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a premarket notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. This process is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval through the lengthy premarket approval application (PMA) process. Manufacturers of most Class II medical devices are required to obtain 510(k) clearance prior to marketing their devices. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a company must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent in intended use and in technological and performance characteristics to another legally marketed 510(k)-cleared predicate device. By regulation, the FDAs performance goals are to clear or deny a 510(k) premarket notification within 90 FDA review days of submission of the application. As a practical matter, clearance may take longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA approval. 
 Class III medical devices are required to undergo the PMA approval process in which the manufacturer must establish the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDAs satisfaction. A PMA application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data as well as information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will typically conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with Quality System Regulations (QSR). FDA reviews of PMA applications generally can take between one and three years, or longer.

 The medical devices that we develop, manufacture, distribute, and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining FDA clearance and other regulatory approvals to develop and market a medical device, particularly from the FDA, can be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. While we believe that we have obtained, or will be able to obtain, all necessary clearances and approvals for the manufacture and sale of our implants and that they are, or will be, in material compliance with applicable FDA and other material regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue such compliance. After an implant is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. Those regulatory requirements may include, as applicable: product listing and establishment registration; Quality System Regulations, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; labeling regulations (including unique device identification (UDI) requirements), and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved, or off-label uses or indications; clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; Medical Device Reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur; post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; the FDAs recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and notices of corrections or removals. 
 We and certain of our suppliers also are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with FDAs QSR and other regulations. If the FDA were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations, the agency could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public Warning Letter to more severe sanctions such as: fines and civil penalties against us, our officers, our employees or our suppliers; unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; delays in clearing or approving, or refusal to clear or approve, our products; withdrawal or suspension of approval of our products or those of our third-party suppliers by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; product recall or seizure; interruption of production; operating restrictions; injunctions; and criminal prosecution. Moreover, governmental authorities outside the United States have become increasingly stringent in their regulation of medical devices, and our products may become subject to more rigorous regulation by non-U.S. governmental authorities in the future. U.S. or non-U.S. government regulations may be imposed in the future that may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. The European Union has nationally transposed regulations based on the European Commission (EC) Medical Device Directives for the control of medical devices with which manufacturers must comply. New medical device regulation (MDR) will replace the medical device directives effective May 26, 2020. Under the current directives and upcoming MDR, manufacturing plants must have received Conformitè Europèene (CE) certification from a notified body in order to be able to sell products within the member states of the European Union. Certification allows manufacturers to stamp the products of certified plants with a CE mark. Products covered by the EC directives that do not bear the CE mark cannot be sold or distributed within the European Union. We have received certification for all currently existing manufacturing facilities and products that we distribute in the European Union. 
 Our products may be reimbursed by third-party payers, such as government programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare or private insurance plans and healthcare networks. Third-party payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device provided to a patient or used in a procedure does not meet applicable payment criteria or if the policy holders healthcare insurance benefits are limited. Also, third-party payers may challenge the medical necessity and prices paid for our products and services. 
 The False Claims Act, Anti-Kickback Statute, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010, as well as state and international anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation, regulate the conduct of medical device companies interactions with the healthcare industry. Among other things, these laws and others generally: (1) prohibit the provision of anything of value in exchange for the referral of patients for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any item or service reimbursed by a federal healthcare program, (including Medicare and Medicaid); (2) require that claims for payment submitted to federal healthcare programs be truthful; and (3) prohibit inappropriate payment to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. RTI maintains a Compliance Program that incorporates the seven fundamental elements as set forth by the Office of the Inspector General within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This facilitates RTIs compliance with requirements regarding the prohibition of inappropriate transfers of value in exchange for referrals or obtaining or retaining foreign business engagements, prohibition regarding the submission of

  inappropriate claims for reimbursement to federal healthcare programs, as well as generally ensuring ethical interactions with the healthcare industry both domestically and internationally. 
 Under Section 6002 of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (known as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act) and similar state and international transparency reporting legislation, RTI is required to collect data regarding payments or other transfers of value to physicians, teaching hospitals, and other persons in the healthcare industry. RTIs Compliance Program ensures all such payments and transfers of value are appropriate per the requirements of applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption legislation and that all required data is reported to relevant governmental entities as called for by applicable transparency reporting legislation. 
 In addition, U.S. federal, state, and international laws protect the confidentiality of certain health information, in particular individually identifiable information such as medical records and restrict the use and disclosure of that protected information. RTI complies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) due to its status as a covered entity related to the provision of a health plan for its employees. RTI is not otherwise regulated by HIPAA, but voluntarily incorporates many HIPAA standards in its corporate policies regarding handling of health data it receives.    At the international level, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU 2016/679) applies to RTIs processing of personal data of residents of the European Union. This law protects processing of all personal data by regulating collection, use, and disclosure as well as privacy and security requirements and imposes penalties for violations. RTI complies with this regulation for both general personal data as well as the higher sensitivity standards for health data and is implementing the standards of this regulation as part of corporate policy for processing of personal data from all jurisdictions. 
 During the third quarter of 2018, we decided to stop procurement, manufacturing and distributing the map3® implants. This activity was completed in the fourth quarter of 2018, with frequent and transparent communication to the FDA. The map3® product is now off the market. 
 Effective May 26, 2020, the European Unions new MDR will replace the current medical device directives. All medical devices currently distributed in the European Union under the medical device directives are likely impacted. The MDR may also include products, such as human tissue, not traditionally considered medical devices in the European Union. Additionally, the MDR, among other things, increases regulatory requirements for several medical device groupings applicable to our implants distributed in the European Union, including strengthening notified body oversight for Class I reusable surgical instruments, and up-classifying spinal devices in contact with the spinal column.
