Item 1. Business
(a) General Development of Business –
Sonoco Products Company ("Sonoco," "the Company," "we," "us," or "our") is a South Carolina corporation originally founded in Hartsville, South Carolina, in 1899 as the Southern Novelty Company. At its beginnings in 1899, a team of 12 people worked from a rented warehouse in Hartsville, South Carolina. The Company’s first product was a cone-shaped paper yarn carrier used for winding and transporting yarn. Since most of the textile cones of that day were wooden, paper cones were a novelty. The Company soon became the leading producer of cones in the United States. The Southern Novelty Company continued to diversify its product line and add new operations around the country. In 1923, the Southern Novelty Company name was changed to Sonoco Products Company, or "Sonoco," using the first two letters from each word of its original name.
Sonoco is now a multi-billion dollar global manufacturer of a variety of consumer, industrial, protective, and healthcare packaging products. The Company has approximately 300 locations in 32 countries, serving some of the world’s best-known brands in some 85 nations. Sonoco is committed to creating sustainable products, services and programs for our customers, employees and communities that support our corporate purpose: Better Packaging. Better Life. Our goal is to bring more to packaging than just the package by offering integrated packaging solutions that help define brand personalities, creating unique customer experiences, and enhancing the quality of products. We seek to help our customers solve their packaging challenges by connecting insights to innovation and developing customized solutions that are tailored to the customer’s goals and objectives.
Sonoco changed its financial reporting structure effective January 1, 2021, to reflect the way it manages its operations, evaluates performance and allocates resources. The revised structure consists of two reportable segments, Consumer Packaging and Industrial Paper Packaging, with all remaining businesses reported as All Other. 
The former Protective Solutions and Display and Packaging segments were eliminated and the underlying businesses and their results were realigned into All Other or, in certain cases, subsumed into the remaining two reportable segments. The Company divested its global display and packaging business in two separate transactions: the European contract packaging business on November 30, 2020 and the U.S. display and packaging business on April 4, 2021. Prior to the divestitures, these businesses were reported in All Other. Information about products and services of these segments and the markets they serve is discussed below under “Description of business.” Segment financial information for prior periods has been recast to conform to the current-year presentation. 
On January 26, 2022, Sonoco completed the acquisition of Ball Metalpack Holding, LLC ("Ball Metalpack"), a leading supplier of sustainable metal packaging for food and household products and the largest aerosol can manufacturer in North America, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.35 billion in cash, subject to customary adjustments, including for working capital, cash and indebtedness.
(c) Description of Business –
Segment Reporting
As noted above, the Company currently reports its financial results in two reportable segments – Consumer Packaging and Industrial Paper Packaging, with all remaining businesses reported as All Other. Further information about the Company’s reportable segments is provided in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We anticipate that the operations of Ball Metalpack will be included in the Consumer Packaging segment in future periods.
Consumer Packaging
The Consumer Packaging segment accounted for approximately 42%, 43% and 41% of the Company’s consolidated net sales in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The operations in this segment consisted of 83 plants throughout the world as of December 31, 2021.

Sonoco uses approximately 46% of the paper it manufactures, and the remainder is sold to third parties. This vertical integration strategy was supported by 23 paper mills with 31 paper machines and 23 recycling facilities throughout the world as of December 31, 2021. In 2021, Sonoco had the capacity to manufacture approximately 2.2 million tons of recycled paperboard. The products,

Other Aspects of the Company's Business
Product Distribution – Each of the Company’s operating units has its own sales staff, and maintains direct sales relationships with its customers. Some of the units have service staff at the manufacturing facility that interact directly with customers. The Industrial Paper Packaging segment and certain operations within the Consumer Packaging segment have customer service centers located in Hartsville, South Carolina, which are the main contact points between their North American business units and their customers. Divisional sales personnel also provide sales management, marketing and product development assistance as needed. Typically, product distribution is directly from the manufacturing plant to the customer, but in some cases, product is warehoused in a mutually advantageous location to be shipped to the customer as needed.
Raw Materials – The principal raw materials used by the Company are recovered paper, paperboard, steel, aluminum and plastic resins. Raw materials are purchased from a number of outside sources. The Company considers the supply and availability of raw materials to be adequate to meet its needs.
Patents, Trademarks and Related Contracts – Most inventions and product and process innovations are generated by Sonoco’s development, marketing and engineering staff, and are important to the Company’s internal growth. Patents have been granted on many inventions created by Sonoco staff in the United States and in many other countries. Patents and trade secrets were acquired as part of acquisitions over the past two years, including the August 2020 acquisition of Can Packaging and the January 2022 acquisition of Ball Metalpack. These patents are managed globally by a Sonoco intellectual capital management team through the Company’s subsidiary, Sonoco Development, Inc. (SDI). SDI globally manages patents, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and license agreements. Some patents have been licensed to other manufacturers. Sonoco also licenses a few patents from outside companies and universities. U.S. patents expire after about 20 years, and patents on new innovations replace many of the abandoned or expired patents. A second intellectual capital subsidiary of Sonoco, SPC Resources, Inc., globally manages Sonoco’s trademarks, service marks, copyrights and Internet domain names. Most of Sonoco’s products are marketed worldwide under trademarks such as Sonoco®, SmartSeal®, Sonotube®, Sealclick®, Sonopost® and UltraSeal®. Sonoco’s registered web domain names provide information about Sonoco, its people and its products. Trademarks and domain names are licensed to outside companies where appropriate.
Seasonality – Although demand for some of the Company's products varies seasonally, overall the Company's operations are not seasonal to any significant degree. 
Dependence on Customers – On an aggregate basis during 2021, the five largest customers in the Consumer Packaging segment and the Industrial Paper Packaging segment accounted for approximately 28% and 9%, respectively, of each segment’s net sales. The five largest customers in the All Other group of businesses accounted for approximately 13% of the group’s net sales.
Sales to the Company’s largest customer represented 4.2% of consolidated revenues in 2021. This concentration of sales volume resulted in a corresponding concentration of credit, representing approximately 3.4% of the Company’s consolidated trade accounts receivable at December 31, 2021. The Company’s next largest customer comprised 3.0% of consolidated revenues in 2021.
Additional information regarding Sonoco's customers is provided in Item 1A - Risk Factors under the caption "Risks Related to Competition, Customers and Suppliers."
Competition – The Company sells its products in highly competitive markets, which include paper, textile, film, food, packaging, construction, and wire and cable. All of these markets are influenced by the overall rate of economic activity, and their behavior is principally driven by supply and demand. Because we operate in highly competitive markets, we regularly bid for new and continuing business. Losses and/or awards of business from our largest customers, customer changes to alternative forms of packaging, and the repricing of business, can have a significant effect on our operating results. The Company manufactures and sells many of its products globally. The Company, having operated internationally since 1923, considers its ability to serve its customers worldwide in a timely and consistent manner a competitive advantage. The Company also believes that its technological leadership, reputation for quality, and vertical integration are competitive advantages. Expansion of 
5 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2021 ANNUAL REPORT 


the Company’s product lines and global presence is driven by the rapidly changing needs of its major customers, who demand high-quality, state-of-the-art, environmentally compatible packaging, wherever they choose to do business. It is important to be a low-cost producer in order to compete effectively. The Company is focused on productivity improvements and other cost-reduction initiatives utilizing the latest in technology. Additional information regarding competition is provided in Item 1A - Risk Factors under the caption "Risks Related to Competition, Customers and Suppliers."
Compliance with Government Regulations and Laws – The Company must comply with extensive laws, rules and regulations in the United States and in each of the countries where it conducts business with respect to a variety of matters. Management believes that the Company is in compliance with all material applicable government regulations, including environmental regulations and does not believe that there is any material impact on capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position as a result of efforts to comply with these regulations. Information regarding compliance with government regulations, including environmental laws, is provided in Item 1A - Risk Factors, in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption “Risk Management,” and in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Culture – At Sonoco, our purpose is engrained in our culture. In fact, it drives our culture. It drives our product development. It drives how we work with our customers and each other. It drives what we do, and the decisions we make. Our purpose isn’t just a collection of words. It represents the collective spirit of an organization focused on one thing: Better Packaging. Better Life.
Sustainability - Packaging plays a fundamental role in providing safe and hygienic delivery systems for food, medicines and other essential products around the world. However, we believe the importance of packaging extends beyond its functionality to also include its impact on the planet. During 2020, we established a new corporate team, led by a staff vice president directly reporting to our CEO, to champion our global sustainability efforts. This team leads the Company’s global sustainability programs for all our Consumer- and Industrial-related packaging businesses, including driving efforts to meet our climate change related goals, and addressing the complex regulatory and policy environment landscape. Additionally, we have set up a Corporate Sustainability Council to provide oversight, guidance, and direction on social, community, and environmental issues that impact the reputation and economic performance of the Company and to help address the concerns of our stakeholders. The Council meets quarterly and reports to and is sponsored by Sonoco’s president and CEO. The Council reports on Sonoco’s sustainability activities, biannually, to the Board of Directors.
Our sustainability goals include the following key elements:
Greenhouse Gas Emissions - While we have reduced normalized greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions by approximately 25% since 2009, we are committed to further improving our environmental impact by setting ambitious new targets to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, which is aimed at limiting the warming of global temperatures to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Specifically, Sonoco aims to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030 from a 2020 base year. We have also set a goal to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 13.5% by 2030 from a 2019 base year by working with our customers and suppliers to develop innovative packaging solutions that reduce packaging waste and improve recyclability. These goals were validated by the Science-Based Target Initiative in June 2021. In addition, we are actively studying necessary operational changes, technology developments and market changes that would be required to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. 
To meet our Science-Based Targets over the next decade, each of our more than 300 global operations are focused on reducing GHG emissions by investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy projects along with purchasing electricity from certified green and reduced-carbon energy sources. In addition, we are incorporating sustainability and environmental metrics into each of our business units’ plans and management incentives.
Energy Usage - In support of our GHG emission reductions, Sonoco aims to continue energy efficiency improvements in our manufacturing plants targeted to reduce normalized energy use by at least 8% by 2030 from a 2020 baseline in addition to investing in energy efficiency, renewable energy and alternative power projects. For example, our "Greening of the Grid" project includes purchasing less carbon intensive electricity from utilities. We believe these actions will reduce cumulative scope 2 GHG emissions by up to 10% by 2030. Also, our ongoing plant efficiency projects are intended to drive an 8% cumulative reduction in scope 1 GHG emissions, stemming from direct investments in plant boiler efficiency, compressed air, LED lighting, vacuum systems, HVAC systems and process chillers. 
Water Usage - Reducing our water consumption is part of being responsible stewards of our planet’s resources. Many of our actions to reduce water usage involve our global paper mills, which account for the majority of our global water usage. We plan to conduct water risk studies at these manufacturing facilities using WRI Aqueduct, WWF Water Rich Filter or similar tools.
Plastic Usage - We are committed to responsibly managing resins use at our facilities and are implementing "Operation Clean Sweep", a program focused on preventing discharge of plastic pellets into the environment. We are also working to ensure we can make relevant on-pack recyclability claims for at least 75% of our global rigid plastic product portfolio, while also ensuring we are closing the loop through continued use of post-consumer recycled content. 
Recycling - We also serve as a valued partner to our customers to reduce the environmental impact of their packaging. As such, by utilizing recycled materials, the Company has already achieved its goal set in 2019 to increase to at least 85% of the amount, based on weight, of product we recycle or cause to be recycled as a percent of the product we put in the marketplace.
We are focused on continuing to reduce energy usage and air emissions by improving energy efficiency through targeted investments and initiatives. We continue to engage in activities and make investments that we believe will enable us to innovate our products and improve our operational infrastructure as well as drive end-of-life solutions for our products and develop partnerships with key stakeholders across our value chain to help deliver sustainable solutions.
Human Capital Management - Sonoco’s core belief that “we are only as strong as our people” underlies our efforts to attract, acquire and retain talented employees for our global businesses. We seek to engage, develop and reward our employee base of approximately 20,500 so they can successfully pursue our purpose of Better Packaging. Better Life. We depend on our employees to achieve our mission of creating sustainable packaging solutions that help build our customers’ brands, enhance the quality of their products and improve the quality of life for people around the world. We work towards this goal by establishing a foundation for actions that support health and safety, diversity and inclusion, and talent development.
Health and Safety – Protecting the health and safety of our employees is a top priority, and we are committed to providing a safe working environment for all our associates. We use global and local incident data along with identifying leading indicators to create program and safety improvement action plans to reduce conditions and behaviors that lead to at-risk situations. In 2021, we moved our safety program from a historical lagging indicator focus to a more proactive, leading indicator approach. Overall injuries in 2021 were slightly down from 2020 but more importantly were down 10% from 2019. To promote the prevention of more significant Life Changing Events, which are injuries or incidents that cause or have the potential to cause permanent disabilities or the loss of life, we engaged outside experts to conduct assessments of high-risk activities and leveraged learnings globally. In addition, we evaluated our safety systems to improve focus and resources. Globally, we achieved completion of 99% of all safety improvement action plans, which are site level improvement plans designed to reduce risk. Finally, our operations leadership worked together to develop a new safety playbook which will be used globally in 2022 to further train our employees.
6 FORM 10-K SONOCO 2021 ANNUAL REPORT 


Our focus on safeguarding the health of our employees continued to evolve around actions we took to reduce exposures to COVID-19. We continued to implement safety protocols across our facilities following recommendations by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. As the pandemic continuously evolved, we put in place measures and practices for the health and safety of our employees, customers and suppliers, and in response to changing local laws. We proactively provided employees with personal protective equipment, and where possible, provided on-site testing and vaccination clinics. 
Diversity and Inclusion – Sonoco embraces Diversity and Inclusion, and our efforts to increase diversity within our Company are an organizational priority. As of December 31, 2021, our employees were located in the following geographic regions: 53% in North America; 19% in Europe, Middle East and Africa; 17% in Latin America; and 11% in Asia Pacific. Our global workforce is 26% female and 74% male and 34% of our U.S. employees identify as a racial minority. We have labor unions in all regions of our operations, and in North America, approximately 16% of our employees are represented by unions. We rely on the unique qualities and talents of our employees to help us meet our strategic priorities. Our Diversity and Inclusion goals are focused on increasing the representation of women and racial minorities into more salaried and senior leadership positions. We are working toward this goal by increasing hiring, focusing on development and promotions, as well as focusing on retention efforts. We made significant progress in talent acquisition during 2021, despite a challenging labor market. In the U.S., 44% of employee hires were female and 34% a member of a minority group in 2021. For the past 10 years, Sonoco’s employees have expanded and improved our Global Diversity and Inclusion Council, which is chaired by our President and CEO. In 2020, the Global Diversity and Inclusion Council chartered a new Business Resource Group ("BRG"), Black Employees @ Sonoco, to join our other five existing BRGs. In 2021, we continued to focus council activities on workforce representation (diversity) and work environment (inclusion) by addressing unconscious bias to promote an environment where diverse backgrounds are appreciated, and diverse ideas are heard. In addition, we are committed to lifting up historically disadvantaged businesses in an effort to make a positive economic impact on society. We have had a dedicated Supplier Diversity program since 2004, and since 2010 we have spent approximately $1.9 billion with certified, diverse suppliers. 
Talent Acquisition and Development – Attracting, developing and retaining talented employees is critical to our success and is an integral part of our human capital strategy. We have created a Global Talent Acquisition and Organization Development team to provide a more holistic approach to managing and enriching the employee lifecycle through continuous training and comprehensive succession planning. In 2021, we significantly expanded Sonoco University, a centralized digital training hub, to provide our employees with diverse learning and career development programs. In addition, we conduct regular talent succession assessments along with individual performance reviews in which managers provide regular feedback and coaching to assist with the development of our employees, including the use of individual development plans to assist with individual career development.
