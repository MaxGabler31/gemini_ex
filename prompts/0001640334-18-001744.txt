General Overview
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 29, 2016. We are engaged in the business of content writing and editing services.
 
On October 26 2017, our Board of Directors approved a forward stock split of our issued and authorized shares of common stock on the basis of 20 new shares for one (1) old share, increasing of our authorized capital from 75,000,000 shares of common stock to 1,500,000,000 shares of common stock. Correspondingly, our issued and outstanding capital increased from 5,590,000 shares of common stock to 111,800,000 shares of common stock. The $0.001 par value of our common shares remained unchanged. The forward stock split was payable upon surrender and no fractional shares were issued. Fractional shares were rounded up.
 
Also on October 26, 2017, our board of directors approved an agreement and plan of merger for the purposes of changing our corporate name from Koldeck Inc. to Global House Holdings Ltd. Pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger, our company merged with our wholly-owned subsidiary Global House Holdings Ltd., a Nevada corporation. Koldeck Inc. remained the surviving company of the merger, continuing under the name Global House Holdings Ltd.
 
The resolutions of our Board of Directors approving the above described forward stock split and name change were subject to the prior approval of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). On January 31, 2018, in anticipation of FINRA approval, we filed a Certificate of Change and Articles of Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State to give effect to the forward stock split and name change. The name change and forward stock split were subsequently approved by FINRA on March 29, 2018 with a market effective date of April 3, 2018. As a result, effective April 3, 2018, we adopted the new trading symbol GHHHD. After 20 business days, the symbol changed to GHHH. Our new CUSIP number is 37891G108.

Our Current Business
 
Our main business activity is content writing and editing services. We plan to deliver our services to both individuals and companies, as well as to printed or digital newspapers and magazines. Our main objective is to provide our customers with a quality service of text composing and editing of written materials. As additional services we may offer help with illustrating and designing book covers, as we plan to hire professional designers if business turns out profitable. We plan to write the texts based on data provided by our customers by mail, by phone or directly in person during the interviews. We also plan to deliver services on writing creative texts such as pieces of fiction, poetry, blog posts, and articles for magazines or newspapers. We also plan to deliver texts not related to fiction such as business proposals, presentations, bids, customer offers and letters. We also plan to offer editing and rewriting services. We also plan to carry out the jobs of editing or rewriting texts to make them more appealing to the final reader, as well as to make them look professionally-written. As business grows we may change our services to the needs of the markets or to the needs of the company or to meet the requirements of our customers.
 
Principal Products or Services and their Markets 
 
We plan to deliver single pieces of texts or consecutive series of them, as well as texts in large volumes such as books. We hope it may turn economically beneficial for the newspapers or magazines from where we expect to get multiple orders. At the initial stages we may promote our services by writing guest posts on different web blogs or blogs of Internet magazines. We might expect more orders from them and start delivering articles. We have an idea of selling services by packages. 
 
Packages may include: composing texts, searching data to compose the text, proofreading and editing of the ready texts. The price for the package will be determined by the average market price for the similar services adding the price of editing, proofreading or amount of data per article to search. To meet the maximum of our customers needs we expect the prices of every package to be negotiable and based on the specification of a certain project. For some additional fee we also intend to provide services on promoting our customers’ books on Amazon, iBooks and similar services.

We expect to receive orders online from our website as our customers may reside in any remote location. As such, we intend to target the broad international public. We plan to use chatbots on the website to collect the orders from clients for our managers. If data in the order is insufficient the customers may be contacted via mail or directly by phone. Managers sort out the orders and hand them to the writers. We can expect to hire freelancers to work for us at a certain stage of development or whenever there is a need for additional workforce. We can expect those freelancers to interview our customers in order to write the texts corresponding to the customer’s needs.
 
Our principal services may be split into the following groups:
 
Creative writing - assistance in writing complete books, manuscripts, biographies, stage plays or screenplays, plots, or outlines for the works mentioned;
 
Business writing - assistance in writing bids, proposals, letters, presentations, research papers;
 
Editing - editing and formatting services, completing or rewriting the texts of non-professional writers;
 
Publishing - finding a publisher, designing a book cover or illustrations.
 
Once the customer chooses their package they agree upon the schedule of receiving and reviewing the work in progress.
 
Competition and Competitive Strategy
 
There are many content writing and editing service companies in the market. It is a very competitive market.
 
We expect to compete as a freelance content writing and editing services company in the Creative Writing, Business Writing, Editing, and Publishing markets. 
 
Currently, our competitive position within the industry is negligible in light of the fact that we are a start up company.
 
However, we plan on being competitive with the following attributes:

 GLOBAL HOUSE HOLDINGS LTD.
 (FORMERLY KOLDECK INC.)
 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 April 30, 2018 and 2017
 
NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
 
GLOBAL HOUSE HOLDINGS LTD. (formerly KOLDECK INC.) (the “Company”) is a corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada on March 29, 2016. The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the company’s business plan.
 
On April 2, 2018, the Company approved an agreement and plan of merger for the purposes of changing our corporate name from Koldeck Inc. to Global House Holdings Ltd. Pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger, our company merged with our wholly-owned subsidiary Global House Holdings Ltd., a Nevada corporation. Koldeck Inc. remained the surviving company of the merger, continuing under the name Global House Holdings Ltd. The name change, as well as a 20:1 forward stock split, was approved by FINRA and effective April 3, 2018 (Note 4). Unless otherwise noted, impacted amounts and share information included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split as if it had occurred on the first day of the earliest period presented.
 
NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN
 
The Company’s consolidated financial statements as of April 30, 2018, been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred a cumulative net loss from inception (March 29, 2016) to April 30, 2018 of $50,638. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.
 
In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company’s fiscal year-end is April 30, 2018.
Use of Estimates
 
Preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions.
Reclassifications
 
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
 


F-6

Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company's bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are insured up to $250,000. At April 30, 2018, the Company's bank deposits did not exceed the insured amounts.
Financial Instruments
 
The Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of accounts payable and debts. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate their respective estimated fair value due to the short-term maturities and approximate market interest rates of these instruments. 
Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share
 
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Income Taxes
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations (see Note 6).
Revenue Recognition
 
The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products and services in accordance with ASC 606,”Revenue Recognition” following the five steps procedure:
 
Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with customers
 Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract
 Step 3: Determine the transaction price
 Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations
 Step 5: Recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation
 
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies its obligation by transferring control of the good or service to the customer. A performance obligation is satisfied over time if one of the following criteria are met:

a. | the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the entity performs; 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b. | the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or 
c. | the entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity, and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.

New Accounting Pronouncements
 
There were various accounting standards and interpretations issued recently, none of which are expected to a have a material impact on our financial position, operations or cash flows.
NOTE 4 – CAPITAL STOCK
 
As of April 30, 2018, and April 30, 2017, the Company had 111,800,000, and 251,800,000 shares issued and outstanding, respectively.
 
On July 20, 2017, the sole officer and director of the Company returned and cancelled 140,000,000 common shares.
 
On October 26, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a forward stock split of the issued and authorized shares of common stock on the basis of 20 new shares for one (1) old share. The forward stock split was effective April 3, 2018 and resulted in the increase of our authorized capital from 75,000,000 shares of common stock to 1,500,000,000 shares of common stock. The issued and outstanding capital increased from 5,590,000 shares of common stock to 111,800,000 shares of common stock. The $0.001 par value of our common shares remains unchanged. Unless otherwise noted, impacted amounts and share information included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split as if it had occurred on the first day of the earliest period presented.

NOTE 5 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 
In support of the Company’s efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers, directors, or shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.
 
From March 29, 2016 (Inception) through April 30, 2018, the Company’s previous sole officer and director loaned the Company $2,343 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses. During the period ended April 30, 2018, upon the transfer of ownership to the new officer and director, the Company transferred the property, plant and equipment with a net book value of $10,084 to the prior officer and director, along with cash payment of $96.

A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations.
 
On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) resulting in significant modifications to existing law. The Company has considered the accounting impact of the effects of the Act during the year ended April 30, 2018 including a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 34% to 21% among other changes. 
 
The components of the Company’s deferred tax asset and reconciliation of income taxes computed at the new statutory rate of 21% to the income tax amount recorded as of April 30, 2018 and April 30, 2017 are as follows:
 

 | April 30, | | | April 30, |
