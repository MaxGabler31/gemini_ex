Corporate History and Overview
 
SmartMetric, Inc. (“SmartMetric” or the “Company”) was incorporated pursuant to the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2002. SmartMetric is a development stage company engaged in the technology industry. SmartMetric’s main products are a fingerprint sensor activated payments card and security card with a finger sensor and fully functional fingerprint reader embedded inside the card. The SmartMetric biometric cards have a rechargeable battery allowing for portable biometric identification and card activation. This card is referred to as a biometric card or the SmartMetric Biometric Card.
The SmartMetric Biometric Technology and Products
 
SmartMetric’s founder, Chaya Hendrick is the originator and inventor of various miniature biometric activated devices including the SmartMetric biometric fingerprint activated payments card with an embedded fully functional fingerprint reader inside the card. The card is the size and thickness of a standard credit card. The SmartMetric biometric payments card provides for high level security for credit and debit cards by adding biometric authentication and activation to Europay, MasterCard and Visa (“EMV”) chip cards in use around the world. The SmartMetric biometric payments card has been manufactured to be totally interoperable with existing EMV chip card readers, ATMs as well as banking payments infrastructure. Using the advanced electronic miniaturization by SmartMetric to make its biometric credit/debit cards the Company has also turned its attention to creating a multi-functional biometric building access control and logical network access card. Since July 1, 2018, SmartMetric has commenced efforts towards creating a biometric health insurance card with memory for storing a person’s medical files as well as assisting in fighting medical fraud by using the card to provide in-card biometric identity validation.
 
SmartMetric has developed its rechargeable battery powered fingerprint reader that is of a scale that fits “inside” a standard credit or debit card. The cardholder has stored inside the card his or her fingerprint. To activate the card the person swipes the fingerprint sensor, the sensor is connected to an internal microprocessor that manages the fingerprint sensor fingerprint image capture and comparison matching with the pre-stored fingerprint of the cardholder held in the internal electronic memory of the card. The card has a surface mounted EMV chip as found on EMV banking chip cards that is activated or turned on only after a card holder’s fingerprint has been scanned and verified using the SmartMetric miniature “in-card” biometric scanner.
 
There are over seven (7) billion EMV chip cards used by banks around the world for credit cards, ATM cards and debit cards according to EMVco. SmartMetric sees this existing user base as a natural market for its advanced biometric activated card technology for the credit and debit card market. SmartMetric has established a network of card manufacturers and technology distributors to market its in-card biometric products to card issuing banks and in the case of the SmartMetric biometric security card, to businesses.
 
SmartMetric has completed development of its biometric card and is now actively marketing its card to major card issuing banks throughout the world in partnership with established card distributors and dealers.
 
We believe the SmartMetric biometric payments card, with a built-in rechargeable battery and EMV banking industry contact interface chip (which activates following a fingerprint match on the card), is the first of its kind in the world.

THE SMARTMETRIC BIOMETRIC IN-CARD FINGERPRINT READER PAYMENTS CARD
 

The SmartMetric biometric fingerprint activated card has several functions: 
 

● | The card-holder’s fingerprint is stored inside the card and NOT on a central computer;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Interoperable with existing smart card, EMV ATM and Retail Point Of Sale Machines;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The fingerprint sensor facilitates instant authorization and card user verification;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Self-powered with an internal rechargeable battery allowing for instant fingerprint scan and activation prior to the card being inserted into a card reader or ATM;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In-card biometric measurement storage safeguards personal information; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In-card biometric storage permits access, identity and transaction control verification. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The SmartMetric Biometric Card contains active and passive components mounted onto a paper-thin circuit board, reducing a powerful Cortex processor (along with many other complex computer components, including memory chips) to very thin components. The process of mounting these components on the thin board has required significant innovations in electronic manufacturing processes.
 
The SmartMetric biometric card could be a leading-edge solution in the identity and access control market. Unlike a picture-based identification system, the SmartMetric biometric card has been designed to operate exclusively with the registered user. And unlike biometric security systems where the biometric information is stored at a central location, the Company believes that security is significantly increased during the verification process since the biometric information is embedded in the card itself, in a memory chip protected by encryption so there is no biometric data is travelling over a network. The built-in fingerprint scanner is designed to activate the card. Without a match with the encrypted fingerprint already stored in the card, the SmartMetric Biometric card will not operate.
 
As an online purchasing/credit card, the biometric payments card can help protect against identity theft and related fraudulent crimes that consumers can be exposed to when making purchases over the Internet. Unlike conventional credit cards, which require a consumer to type and deliver sensitive information over the internet in order to make a purchase, the biometric card is designed to be inserted into a reader that is connected to the USB port of a computer. Using a USB port adapter any customer purchasing information can then only be released from the card when the owner’s finger print unlocks the card. The consumer’s information then travels across the Internet encrypted, minimizing exposure to interception by hackers and identity thieves.

SmartMetric believes that its biometric security card, by way of containing information unique to the individual user, protected by the card user’s biometrics, will be useless in the hands of others. Unlike a picture-based identification system, the SmartMetric biometric card has been designed to operate exclusively with the registered user. The fingerprint sensor built into the card has been designed to activate the card. Without a match with the encrypted fingerprint already stored on the card, the biometric card will not operate.
 
The SmartMetric access control and identity biometric card is a card that authorized persons will carry with them and activate to obtain access. Such activation will take place by placing a finger on a fingerprint sensor on the surface of the card. The SmartMetric biometric cards are designed to be read by both contact and contactless card acceptor devices. For contact card acceptor devices, the device must touch a chip mounted on the surface of the biometric card. This contact allows the card to transmit data to the reading device. For contactless acceptor devices, a radio frequency signal will be sent from the card to a radio frequency signal receiver in the acceptor device. In both types of card reading devices, the activation signal is sent only when there has been a positive match of the person’s fingerprint by the card’s fingerprint sensor. The card reader devices are standard smartcard readers available from a variety of third parties.
 
The memory and computational capacities of the biometric card are used to store a user’s fingerprint(s). The computational capacity is used to process a digitized image from the fingerprint sensor to confirm a match (or no match) with the fingerprint template. Additional computational processes such as increased cryptography will depend on the requirements of specific customers.

The SmartMetric biometric fingerprint activated card has several functions:
 

IN CARD FINGERPRINT MATCHING AND VERIFICATION
 

The SmartMetric Biometric card incorporates a rechargeable, lithium polymer battery. This battery is rechargeable, very thin and has been designed by SmartMetric to fit inside the SmartMetric fingerprint credit card sized card. This battery is manufactured by a third party unaffiliated with the Company to SmartMetric’s specifications. This battery is embedded inside the card.

Other components needed for manufacture of the SmartMetric Biometric Card include, but are not limited to, sensors, microchips, memory chips and processor chips. The sources and availability of these materials are numerous, readily available and should not affect the ability of SmartMetric to meet future demand. However, SmartMetric does engineer a number of important components at silicon level to achieve the component size required to fit inside a credit card. Both the supply of memory and processors in silicon wafers may be interrupted at any time based on global silicon supply/demand issues and the engineering of silicon by SmartMetric may also cause end component supply problems from time to time which may affect production and sale of the Cards. We have not experienced component supply issues to date and the Company, as a matter of policy, has alternative component sources.
 
The biometric card has been designed to offer the option of a built-in radio frequency transmitter for contactless long-range access and identity verification. Another version of the card incorporates a short-range RFID contactless chip that is also turned off and on using the card users fingerprint verification.
 
The thinness form factor of many of the components including the processor itself, being an unpackaged wafer of silicon, has also resulted in the Company having to develop its own process for high volume electronic assembly. The Company has also successfully overcome the challenge of developing a process of encapsulating the electronics in plastic to create the credit card sized biometric fingerprint activated card.
 
Standard credit card manufacturing utilizes machines that require high pressure and high temperature in fusing top and bottom sheets of plastic together thereby encasing any electronics inside the card. Given the complexity of the card’s electronics and vulnerability to an assembly process involving high heat and high pressure, damage to the electronic circuitry was a major challenge for the Company to overcome. Research and development activities of the Company allowed the Company to achieve this ability through a combination of adjusting the pressure and heat required using special polymers together with a trade secret process that protects the silicon that is mounted directly onto the internal electronics circuit board.
 
The Security Technology Industry 
 
SmartMetric Biometric Multi-Function Security Card
 
SmartMetric has developed a multi-function logical and physical access security card this size and thickness of a standard credit card. Utilizing the small size breakthroughs by the Company in its biometric payments card development, SmartMetric has successfully developed a biometric security card that can easily fit inside a person’s wallet.
 
As with the biometric payments card, the SmartMetric security card has an internal rechargeable battery that is used to power the card’s internal processor used in the biometric fingerprint scan. All functions and operations of the card are subject to a valid fingerprint scan and match of the card user.
 
The main features of the SmartMetric biometric security card are:
 

1. | Logical access smartcard card chip for insertion into a card reader attached to a computer or network 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | RFID transceiver for physical access i.e. doorways, elevators, etc. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Validation indicator light that glows green immediately following a fingerprint validation 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Rechargeable battery to power the card
---+---------------------------------------


5. | Size and thickness of a credit card
---+------------------------------------


6. | Changeable security code on reverse of card for additional log on security

Biometrics
 
Biometric technologies identify users by electronically capturing a specific biological or behavioral characteristic of that individual, such as a fingerprint or voice or facial feature, and creating a unique digital identifier from that characteristic. Because this process relies on largely unalterable human characteristics, positive identification can be achieved independent of any information possessed by the individual seeking authorization.
 
The process of identity authentication typically requires that a person present for comparison with one or more of the following factors:
 

● | Something known such as a password, PIN or mother’s maiden name; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Something carried such as a token, card, or key; or 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | something physical such as fingerprint, voice pattern, signature motion, facial shape or other biological or behavioral characteristic. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Comparison of biological and behavioral characteristics has historically been the most reliable and accurate of the three factors but has also been the most difficult and costly to implement into a single product that can automatically verify the identity of a user accessing a computer network or the Internet. However, recent advances in biometric collection technologies (both biometric hardware products and their associated processing software) have increased the speed and accuracy and reduced the cost of implementing biometrics in commercial environments. Management believes that individuals, website operators, government organizations, and businesses will increasingly use this method of identity authentication.
 
Biometrics refers to the automatic identification of a person based on his/her physiological or behavioral characteristics. This method of identification is preferred over traditional methods involving passwords and personal identification numbers (“PINs”) for two reasons: (i) the person to be identified is required to be physically present at the point of identification to be identification; and (ii) identification based on biometric techniques obviates the need to remember a password or carry a token. By replacing PINs, biometric techniques can potentially prevent unauthorized access to or fraudulent use of cellular phones, Biometric cards, desktop PCs, workstations and computer networks. It can be used during transactions conducted via telephone and Internet (e-commerce and e-banking). In automobiles, biometrics could replace keys-less entry devices. The SmartMetric fingerprint activated credit card that has the fingerprint encased inside the credit card has been developed to replace the less secure PIN’s for credit and debit cards.
 
PINs and passwords may be forgotten, may be hacked and token-based methods of identification, e.g., passports and driver’s licenses, may be forged, stolen or lost. Various types of biometric systems are being used for real-time identification, with the most popular based on facial recognition and fingerprint matching. Other biometric systems utilize iris and retinal scanning, speech, facial thermograms and hand geometry. Of the biometric options available to work with a credit or debit card, fingerprint scanning is the only biometric methodology that has been successfully reduced in size to fit inside such cards.
 
A biometric system is essentially a pattern recognition system, which makes a personal identification by determining the authenticity of a specific physiological or behavioral characteristic possessed by the user. An important issue in designing a practical system is to determine how an individual is identified.
 
There are two different ways to resolve a person’s identity; verification and identification. Verification (Am I whom I claim I am?) involves confirming or denying a person’s claimed identity. In identification, one has to establish a person’s identity (Who am I?).
 
As stated above, the SmartMetric fingerprint biometric card has been designed as a credit-card sized card embedded with an integrated circuit, contact chip and biometric fingerprint sensor. The SmartMetric card has been designed to provide not only memory capacity, but also computational capability along with secure non-refutable identification of the user. We believe that the self-containment of SmartMetric’s card makes it substantially resistant to attack, as it will not need to depend upon vulnerable external resources. Because of this characteristic, we expect that the SmartMetric biometric card may be used in different applications, which require strong security protection and authentication.

The physical structure of a card is specified by the International Standards Organization (“ISO”). Generally, this structure is made up of three elements: (i) the plastic card, which is the most basic one and has the dimensions of 85.60mm x 53.98 x 0.80mm; (ii) an electronic circuit board inlay; and (iii) a contact chip that are embedded in the card.
 
The SmartMetric card has been designed to conform to ISO standards. The electronic circuit inlay is a part of, and not distinct from, the biometric card.
 
The communication line between the card and ATMs and other standard Smart Card reading devices is bi-directional serial transmission, which conforms to ISO standards. Card commands and input data are sent to the chip that responds with status words and output data upon the receipt of these commands and data. Information is sent in half duplex mode (transmission of data is in one direction at a time). This protocol, together with the restriction of the bit rate, is designed to prevent data attack on the card. Other data protection systems are utilized inside the card including advanced encryption.
 
In general, the size, the thickness and bend requirements for the biometric card were designed to protect the card from being spoiled physically.
