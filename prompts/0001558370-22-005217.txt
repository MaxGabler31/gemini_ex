ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Overview
Revolutionizing Allogenic cell therapies for multiple oncology indications.
Kiromic BioPharma, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) is an artificial intelligence (“AI”) driven, end-to-end allogenic cell therapy company, currently developing the multi-indication allogeneic T cell therapy that exploits the natural potency of the Gamma Delta T cell (“GDT”) to target solid tumors. 
Our end-to-end approach consists of target discovery and validation, product development, and good manufacturing practices (“GMP”) manufacturing, which we believe will allow us to leverage a new framework for the next generation of cell therapies. We also have new technologies in development that we believe will support our end-to-end approach.
From a target discovery standpoint, our proprietary target discovery engine is called "Diamond." The Diamond platform is a suite of data mining algorithms that identify cancer-specific immunotherapy targets and AI models that evaluate the quality of potential targets. We believe that Diamond dramatically accelerates the development of live drug technologies by quickly locating rare cancer-specific targets in vast databases of billions of genomic datapoints and by applying the latest in machine learning methods to eliminate targets likely to fail prior to costly laboratory validation and development. From a development standpoint, Kiromic utilizes innovative engineered GDT manufacturing technologies and is developing proprietary, virus-free gene editing tools, to develop novel therapies for solid tumors that will be effective and cost-efficient. Our Allogenic Lead Exogenous Isoforms (“ALEXIS”) platform consists of allogeneic cell therapy products, currently in the pre-Investigational New Drug development stage. Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application enabling, non-clinical pharmacology studies are supportive for the GDT-based therapy.
​
Our ALEXIS-PRO-1 trial candidate is our allogeneic GDT therapy product targeting PD-L1. Our ALEXIS-ISO-1 trial candidate is our allogenic GDT therapy product targeting an isoform of Mesothelin that is preferentially present on tumor cells, namely Mesothelin Isoform 2 (“Isomeso”). The IND applications for these trial candidates are currently on a clinical hold as of June 2021. We are currently working on addressing the FDA’s comments. Accordingly, for ALEXIS-PRO-1, we expect the clinical hold will be lifted in the second half of 2022 allowing us to begin the activation process for the clinical trial by the end of the last quarter of 2022. For ALEXIS-ISO-1, we expect to begin the activation process for the clinical trial by the end of the last quarter of 2023. 
​
From a manufacturing standpoint, Kiromic uses in-house R&D laboratory facilities, an on-site animal facility for non-clinical studies, current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) production facilities for vector and cell manufacturing with a dedicated on-site quality control laboratory, which we believe will ensure rapid discovery, validation, development and a streamlined clinical product release. We believe that our allogeneic, off-the-shelf (“OTS”) manufacturing process will result in short lead times and low costs, opening up opportunities for outpatient treatment.
​
Finally, our other technologies in development consist of:

- | An Invariant Natural Killer T cell (“iNKT”) platform targeting PDL1 and other tumor-preferred isoforms, similar to Isomeso. iNKT is considered as an unconventional T cell population with semi invariantly re-arranged T cell Receptor (“TCR”). They recognize many tumor-associated lipid antigens via their endogenous anti-tumor receptor, CD1d, which does not react against allogenic cells, making iNKT ideally suitable for allogenic cancer cell therapies. The innate ability of iNKTs to kill tumor cells combined with minimal graft versus host disease (“GvHD”) risk provides an extremely attractive platform for developing OTS product. Although the relative percentage of iNKTs are very low in peripheral blood we believe that we have developed an efficient method of enriching, expanding, and engineering a pure population of iNKTs on a large scale, suitable for commercial manufacturing. We have proven the high efficiency of our iNKTs to kill tumor cells in vitro and in an in vivo pilot study, and this year we will commence extensive IND application enabling studies.

- | ABBIE, which is a novel cell engineering system to manufacture GMP-grade off the shelf cell therapies without the use of a viral vector, thus making our products safer and easier to manufacture.

KiroVAX / BSK01 was our Phase 1 cell therapy cancer vaccine candidate and consisted of professional antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells) which were matured and pulsed with tumor specific antigens, yielding a tumor-targeted, next-generation cellular therapy vaccine designed for the therapeutic treatment of multiple types of solid cancers. The 

7




trials terminated during fiscal year 2018 due to enrollment limitations. Although strategies have not yet been activated to advance the KiroVax/BSK01 platform, Kiromic is planning to leverage its clinical experience with BSK01 to develop an innovative technology aimed to boost the persistency of its allogenic cell therapy products.
​
Target Discovery: Diamond (Identify, Screen, Prioritize)
Diamond addresses the main challenges in today's clinical pipeline: target identification. 
Successful development of precision immunotherapies requires a distinguishing feature of tumor cells, a target. The target must be common on tumor cells but not on normal cells. It also must be accessible and able to trigger an effective immune response. It is both critical and extremely difficult to find good immunotherapy targets. 
Kiromic’s Diamond does just that. Diamond is an integrated suite of data mining and AI algorithms that can identify and validate novel cancer immunological targets. The targets it identifies are segments of cell surface proteins (peptides) that are specific to tumor cells and that can be bound by immune T cells or B cells. Diamond generates a prioritized list of cancer immunological targets. These targets can be used to create therapies such as antibody therapies, T cell therapies, Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell (“CAR-T cell”) therapies and vaccine therapies.
Diamond has a large and growing database of genomics, proteomics, cytometry, demographics, 3D structures, and gene models and annotations. The data base has approximately 2 billion data points and is an integrated collection of large public consortium datasets and Kiromic proprietary study data. The data covers 38 types of cancer 47 types of normal human tissue with hundreds of samples and millions of datapoints for each. 
We believe that the Diamond data mining tools drive discovery by sifting these billions of data points to identify rare cancer-specific immunotherapy targets. Diamond AI predictions then validate targets to find those that are most likely to be stably presented on the surface of tumor cells and that have strong immunological binding properties. We believe that the predictions speed development and reduce costs by quickly eliminating targets that would likely fail later in laboratory validation or development. 
 Most damaged cells are quickly identified and eliminated by the immune system. Damaged cells that become cancer are those that acquire changes, allowing them to evade the immune system and to proliferate. One common change of this type is an alteration of messenger RNA (“mRNA”) splicing patterns. Changes in mRNA splicing lead to altered proteins (isoforms) that provide selective advantages to the tumor cells but also provide potential as cancer-specific immunotherapy targets. 
 ​

 ​
To solve the problem of identifying common cancer-specific antigens derived from alternative splicing, we have developed a fully integrated in silico methodology to predict cancer-specific isoforms
Diamond allows for the prediction and prioritization of iso-antigens which are a novel source of tumor targets, highly specific for neoplastic cells but without the drawback of also being highly patient-specific.
Diamond analyzes tens of thousands of isoforms from 10,000+ tumor samples and 7,000+ normal samples to create a rank order list of isoforms that are strongly expressed in tumor but not in normal samples. It supports identification of targets for specific tumor types, sub-populations of patients, or cross-tumor type targets. In each case, tumor expression is compared to all profiled normal tissues. Diamond can distinguish splicing alterations that lead to unique protein regions or unique protein sequence junctions. The unique regions are the basis for identification of a target peptide. Diamond can also refine results to focus on just proteins that are presented on the surface of cells. 

​
After a prioritized list of cancer-specific protein isoforms is developed by our data mining tools, a specific target peptide must be selected and targets must be vetted with in-silico methods to quickly eliminate those likely to fail later in development. The Diamond platform includes a suite of AI, machine learning models that assist in selection of the most promising targets. These include:
 T cell immune response. An AI trained on thousands of interactions between antigens and immune cells to predict presentation and Major Histocompatibility Complex (“MHC”) binding. These predictions guide selection of optimal target peptide from cancer specific protein regions and eliminate candidates with poor predicted immune interaction. 
B Cell response. An AI trained on thousands of epitope / antibody interactions from three-dimensional structures of antibody binding to predict B cell binding of candidate target peptides. These predictions also can be used for relevant 

9




therapy design to select the optimal target within a cancer-specific protein region and to eliminate candidates with poor binding predictions.
Transmembrane prediction. Immunotherapies like CAR-T cell therapies work optimally on proteins with cancer-specific alterations of cell surface proteins. Generally, cell surface proteins have a portion that stays inside the cell (cytoplasmic), a portion that cross the cell membrane (transmembrane), and a portion that is outside on the cell’s surface (extracellular). A good target for CAR-T cells needs to be on the extracellular portion of a protein that is altered by cancer but that is not so dramatically altered that it is no longer a transmembrane protein. A Diamond machine learning model trained on the properties of transmembrane proteins is used to ensure that these criteria are meet.
Protein Structure prediction. Diamond leverages the latest advances in 3D protein folding / structure prediction using deep neural networks to model the shape of cancer-specific protein alterations. The predicted structure is used to evaluate the stability of the altered protein and the accessibility of potential targets.
Proteomic validation. Diamond includes a database of mass spectrometry proteomic data that was reprocessed to broadly identify protein fragments from alternative gene isoforms. This data can in some cases be used to validate that cancer-specific alterations present in the transcriptome do in-fact result in production of altered proteins by the tumor cells.
Research assistant. Even with many AI tools assisting in target selection, skilled human researchers still need to perform detailed investigation of potential targets. Many of these tasks are repetitive and time consuming so Diamond includes an automated assistant that speeds up this research by gathering relevant publications, figures, gene annotations, and connections to useful external tools.
 The Diamond platform is now developed entirely by Kiromic’s in-house bioinformatics group who interact regularly with Kiromic researchers selecting targets and designing therapies. This close, responsive collaboration allows for rapid evolution and improvement of the system in meeting research needs. Further, the system has been reconstructed to have a modular, pluggable architecture that is able to quickly accommodate advances in scientific or computational methods as well as new immunotherapy designs. 
​
​
Development: Using Engineered Allogeneic GDT Based Therapies
After Diamond allows us to identify targets on solid tumors, we seek to use those targets to train immune cells. The trained immune cells generate a therapeutic immune response in patients. These peptide sequences, known as tumor-specific iso-antigens (“TSIAs”), generate an immunological response and therefore eradicate cancer cells.
Our Approach
Our goal is to defeat cancer by developing immunotherapies that rely on improving target discovery and validation. With better targets, we believe that our therapies will be more effective than the current crop of immunotherapies using older targets. 
We are currently in the process of completing the preclinical work needed to amend our INDs for first in-human off the shelf gamma delta chimeric PD-L1 GDTs, and chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”) (Isomeso) GDT therapy products. Our target indications will be metastatic and progressive locally advanced solid malignancies which have no curative options. These biomarkers have been validated in-vitro and in-vivo, with preclinical animal models. 
​
Next Generation Allogeneic Therapy Summary
​
We believe that our Next Generation Allogeneic Approach results in the following: 
​

1. | Addressing a Growing Market: Solid tumors represent approximately 90% of new cases according to the American Cancer Society, we believe that our therapies can address a significant contingency of these cases.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Thwarting Antigen Escape by Targeting PD-L1: Similarly, since many solid tumors have a wide expression of PD-L1, we believe that our ALEXIS-PRO-1 trial candidate can effectively treat most solid cancers.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10





3. | Exploitation of GDT’s Natural Potency: Further, by using GDT, we believe that our trial candidates can achieve superior safety and superior efficacy based on our pre-clinical results.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are developing our brand of CAR cell product candidates designed to treat cancer by capitalizing on the immune system's ability to destroy cancer cells. These products are in the pre-IND stage of the FDA clinical trial process.
The following presents a detailed explanation of each component listed above:
Addressing a Growing Target Market 
​
CAR-T cell therapy, a form of cancer immunotherapy, has recently emerged as a revolutionary and potentially curative therapy for patients with hematologic cancers, including refractory cancers. In 2017, two autologous anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapies, Kymriah, developed by Novartis International AG, and Yescarta, developed by Kite Pharma, Inc., (now part of Gilead), were approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed/recurrent B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and relapsed/recurrent large B cell lymphoma, respectively. Autologous CAR-T cell therapies are manufactured individually for the patient's use by modifying the patient's own T cells outside the body, causing the T cells to express CARs. The entire manufacturing process is dependent on the viability of each patient's T cells and takes approximately three to four weeks. 
​
It’s important to note that the aforementioned therapies were for only hematological indications. Currently, these indications represent about 10% of new cases, while solid cancers comprise approximately 90% of new cases. 
​
Further, we believe that the overall global CAR-T cell therapy market could expand to over $33 billion by 2027. Additionally, by focusing on an allogeneic approach, we believe that we can provide a simplified and efficient supply chain with improved product availability compared to the autologous therapies. Allogeneic CAR-T cell therapies involve engineering healthy donor T cells, which we believe will allow for the creation of an inventory of OTS products that can be delivered to a larger portion of eligible patients throughout the world.
​
Allogenic engineered T cells are manufactured in a similar manner as autologous, but with two key differences: (i) allogeneic T cells are derived from healthy donors, not cancer patients, and (ii) allogeneic T cells have a decreased risk of GvHD, a condition where T cells recognize the patient's normal tissues as foreign and cause damage to the patient.
​
In order to focus on this market most effectively, we used Diamond to identify and validate two key targets: PD-L1 and the Isoform of Mesothelin. 
​
For example, below is a graphic of the indications we believe that our ALEXIS-ISO-1 clinical candidate may be able to effectively treat, including Ovarian, Cervical, Mesothelioma, Ovarian, Endometrial, and Pancreatic cancers.
​
​

11




ALEXIS-ISO-1 will be studied in a Phase 1, Open-label, Dose Escalation Study of an Allogeneic Gamma Delta CAR-T Cell Therapy (KB-ISM) in “Subjects with Isomesothelin Positive Metastatic or Progressive Locally Advanced Solid Malignancies.”
​
The primary goal will be to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy at increasing dose levels in order to estimate the optimal biologic dose (“OBD”) which will serve as the dose for an additional 20 patient cohort expansion.
Prior to treatment, all patients are expected to undergo selected screening process to assure that they meet all the corresponding inclusion and exclusion criteria and are expressing the intended target (Isomeso).
​
We filed Phase 1 IND submissions for both ALEXIS-PRO-1 and ALEXIS-ISO-1 in May 2021. Those applications were placed on a clinical hold during June of 2021, and we are currently working on addressing the FDA’s comments. Accordingly, for ALEXIS-PRO-1, we expect the clinical hold will be lifted in the second half of 2022 allowing us to begin the activation process for the clinical trial by the end of the last quarter of 2022. For ALEXIS-ISO-1, we expect to begin the activation process for the clinical trial by the end of the last quarter of 2023. 
​
Next, we will discuss our PD-L1 target, which we believe has even more potential applications to effectively treat solid tumors.
​
Thwarting Antigen Escape by Targeting PD-L1
To further boost the potency of our effector cells, we have developed an off the shelf chimeric gamma delta PD1T cell switch receptor therapy that interferes with the inhibitory "checkpoint" protein, PD-L1, found on most tumor cells and cells of the tumor microenvironment (“TME”). We believe that most solid cancers such as lung, melanoma, gastric, esophagus, colorectal, breast, prostate, liver, urothelial, renal, cervical, and head and neck can potentially now be effectively treated by targeting the checkpoint inhibitor PD-L1. By converting what is normally an inhibitory signal into an activating signal, we predict that this will overcome the resistance of the TME and mitigate the issue of antigen loss typically seen with solid malignancies. 
The graphic below demonstrates how we believe our engineered GDTs significantly enhance the immune response. First, it blocks the ability of checkpoint like PD-L1 from inactivating a T cell (similar to checkpoint inhibitors). Second, engineered GDTs are now able to kill cancer cells with enhanced potency upon binding with the PD-L1 receptor. Below is a graphic demonstrating how we believe this engagement will appear on the TME.
The chPD1 Receptor is activated by engagement with PD-L1+ (or even PD-L2+) tumors.
Typical checkpoint inhibitors block PD-1 and PD-L1, although they have limitations since they do nothing to actually activate/energize the T cell into action, and since typically the subject’s T cells are not working properly, the results are not as optimized as they would otherwise be.
Our chPD-1 (chimeric PD-1) thus takes it a step further by converting PD-1 and PD-L1 from an inhibitory signal to an activation signal. This transformation allows our chimeric T cells to then kill solid tumor cells and the cells of the TME.
Although this chimeric PD1 GDT can effectively lyse both hematologic and solid tumors expressing PD-L1, the focus of the first related IND submission will focus on solid malignancies that express PD-L1 as this represents one of the greatest needs in oncology at this time. This IND submission is supported by strong in vitro and in vivo tumor cytotoxicity data, and thus far no significant adverse effects have been noted in the animal models tested, which has included the testing of multiple types of solid malignancies.

Development Plan
ALEXIS-PRO-1 will be studied in a Phase 1, First-in-Human, Open-label, Dose Escalation Study of an Allogeneic Gamma Delta PD1 T Cell Switch Receptor Therapy (KB-PD1) in “Subjects with PD-L1 Positive Metastatic or Progressive Locally Advanced Solid Malignancies.”
The primary goal will be to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy at increasing dose levels in order to estimate the OBD which will serve as the dose for an additional 20 patient cohort expansion. 
Prior to treatment, all patients are expected to undergo selected screening process to assure that they meet all the corresponding inclusion and exclusion criteria and are expressing the intended target (PD-L1).
We expect the clinical hold will be lifted in the second half of 2022 for the ALEXIS-PRO-1 IND application, allowing us to begin the activation process for the clinical trial by the end of the last quarter of 2022.
Next, we will provide additional information on why we believe that the GDT approach exploits optimal potency for both of our trial candidates (ALEXIS-PRO-1 and ALEXIS-ISO-1).
Exploitation of GDT’s Natural Potency 
We have two simple claims with respect to our allogeneic AI driven GDT engineering approach. 

1. | We believe that our GDTs are safer than other CAR-T cell approaches;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | We believe that our GDTs are more efficacious than other CAR-T cell approaches.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below, safety and efficacy are discussed in greater detail.
Safety
Current FDA approved CAR-T cell therapy products carry a high risk of side effects including the Cytokine Release Syndrome (“CRS”) and Immune Cell Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (“ICANS”). We believe that GDTs contain minimal to no CRS or ICANS, or GvHD between donors and patients.
The graphic below demonstrates that our GDTs for checkpoint PD-L1 are shown to be safe in animal testing. The graphs demonstrate serological tests of organ damage biomarkers. In the experiment, the athymic Balb/c Nude mice were subcutaneously implanted with NCI-H226 and were treated intravenously with checkpoint PD-L1 GDTs. Serum biomarkers were measured. Graphs show the means out of 5 mice per group, while error bars indicate standard deviations.

13




We also performed preclinical experiments on safety on our ALEXIS-ISO-1 clinical candidate, which contains allogeneic GDTs expressing the isoform of mesothelin. The experiments tested for inflammatory cytokines in mice. The cytokines in panel were not significantly different in CAR GDT treated mice compared with untreated or non-transduced GDT treated mice. In effect, our scientific team drew the conclusion that there was no significant difference in inflammatory markers with our engineered GDTs.
​
Efficacy
We believe that our engineered checkpoint PD-L1 GDT approach is potentially more efficacious than non-engineered GDT approaches. The figures below demonstrate our experimentation of that hypothesis. The results indicate the in vivo efficacy and tolerability of GDTs (5 x 106 cells) in athymic Balb/c Nude mice subcutaneously implanted with the PD-L1+ cell line, NCI-H226 (10 (6) cells). The dotted vertical line indicates the day when the GDTs were administered (day +15). Graphs show the average (A) tumor volumes and (B) weights of 10 mice (Saline, GDTs, chPD1 GDTs), or five mice (tumor-free), with a 95% confidence interval. 
In summation, our GDT therapy reduced tumor size to zero within approximately eight days in mice, while showing no weight loss. Conversely, mice treated intravenously with either non-engineered GDTs or untreated (saline) experienced statistically significant tumor growth.
Similarly, we believe that our engineered GDTs targeting the isoform of mesothelin are potentially more efficacious than non-engineered GDT approaches. The figures below demonstrate our experimentation of that hypothesis. We tested the in vivo efficacy and tolerability of a high dose of GDT in Balb/c nude mice sub-cutaneously implanted with the mesothelioma cell line, NCI-H226. Fifteen days after tumor cell implantation, mice with comparable tumor volumes were then divided into three groups (n=10 mice/group) and were (i) injected with our CAR GDTs, (ii) injected with non-

14




engineered GDTs, iii) injected with saline solution. Tumor volumes and mice weight were measured daily for an additional 30 days. The dotted vertical line indicates the day when the GDTs were administered. Graphs show the tumor growth/reduction and body weight from the ten tested mice (Saline, our CAR GDTs, non-engineered GDTs), or five mice (tumor-free), with a 95% confidence interval.
In summation, our GDT therapy reduced tumor size to zero within approximately eight days in mice, while showing no weight loss. Conversely, mice treated intravenously with either non-engineered GDTs or untreated (saline) experienced statistically significant tumor growth.

Manufacturing Allogeneic OTS Therapies
Our proprietary manufacturing approach utilizes unique in-house processes that maximize yield and deliver engineered T cells that are significantly more potent compared to the competition. The graphic below shows our unique process compared to traditional processes.
For our allogeneic products, the cells are collected from a healthy donor. The collected cells are then sent to the Kiromic central processing facility, where the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, including GDTs, are isolated. 
These cells are stimulated to proliferate, then transduced with a non-replicating retroviral vector.
We are also developing ABBIE, which is a non-viral gene-editing mechanism to insert the target DNA template information into the GDT genome. The genomic sequence will direct the expression of proteins on the cell surface that allows the transduced GDTs to recognize and bind to a target molecule that is present on cancer cells.
These engineered cells are then propagated in cell culture bags until sufficient cells are available. The engineered GDTs are then washed and frozen at the cell processing site.
This inventory will be securely stored and then shipped to oncology centers as needed.
As noted previously, GDTs are currently engineered by using an industry standard retroviral vector, however, in future versions we expect to utilize our non-viral ABBIE gene editing platform.
Manufacturing Operations 
We have invested resources to optimize our manufacturing process, including the development of improved analytical methods. We plan to continue to invest in process science, product characterization and manufacturing to continuously improve our production and supply chain capabilities over time.
Our product candidates are designed and manufactured via a platform comprised of defined unit operations and technologies. The process is gradually developed from small to larger scales, incorporating compliant procedures to create current cGMP conditions. Although we have a platform-based manufacturing model, each product is unique and for each new product candidate, a developmental phase is necessary to individually customize each engineering step and to create a robust procedure that can later be implemented in a cGMP environment to ensure the production of clinical batches. This work is performed in our research and development environment to evaluate and assess variability in each step of the process in order to define the most reliable production conditions.
We believe that all materials and components utilized in the production of the cell line, retroviral vector and final T cell product are readily available from qualified suppliers.
In addition, we believe we have sufficient space at our headquarters in Houston, Texas, to support clinical grade operations.

16




If any of our product candidates are approved, to meet projected needs for commercial sale quantities, we anticipate that we will need to obtain additional manufacturing capacity. 
Benefits
We believe that the manufacturing of our therapies with these process and infrastructure results in the following key benefits:

1. | No Lead Time – OTS therapies are ready on demand. They are produced in advance of patient visits and are cryogenically frozen. Conversely, autologous therapies have approximately three to five weeks of lead time.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Outpatient Treatment – This means reduced hospitalization and other treatment related costs. Current hospitals struggle to break even if CAR-T cell therapies are administered in the inpatient setting.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Lower Production Costs – We have In-house cGMP manufacturing (full control and vertical integration of the manufacturing process) for vector production and cell therapy production.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

iNKT Summary
Effective CAR-T cell therapy targeting B cell malignancies have paved the way for alternate strategies targeting cancer. Current active research is directed towards development of safe, allogeneic OTS therapy products. 
This could be potentially a step forward in the targeted cancer immunotherapy field. iNKT are deemed as one of the unconventional T cell populations with semi invariantly re-arranged TCR. They recognize lipid antigens via CD1d, an MHC Class 1 like molecule. 
Recognition of CD1d expressed on various hematopoietic cells is important for targeted tumor specific iNKT cytotoxicity in various leukemia and lymphoma malignancies. 
In recent years, CAR iNKT adoptive cell therapy has drawn excitement and interest because of its intrinsic anti-tumor properties. More specifically CAR iNKTs have been shown to target solid tumors such as neuroblastoma in preclinical studies and proceeded to phase 1 clinical trials. The innate ability of iNKTs to kill tumor cells and to also cause very few GVHD events provides an extremely attractive platform for developing OTS products. 
Allogeneic CAR iNKTs have been less explored for cancer immunotherapy. Although the relative percentage of iNKTs are very low in peripheral blood (~0.01% of T-lymphocytes), we developed an efficient method to enrich and expand a large and pure population of iNKTs and genetically modify them for targeting solid tumors. The CAR transduced iNKTs are highly potent against tumor cells and suggest a central memory phenotype that could potentially persist longer in vivo.
Development Plan
We developed a method to obtain pure high-quality, and active iNKTs that is easily scalable.
A dramatic increase of iNKT purity during in vitro stimulation, enrichment, and expansion processes, is shown in the figures below. Figure (A) shows a schematic diagram of the isolation, enrichment and genetic modification process of iNKTs, and Figure (B) shows that, owing to a small percentage of iNKTs in peripheral blood our method enables us to enrich and expand a pure population of iNKTs. 

17




​
As shown below, highly pure iNKTs can be expanded with our methodology. The left-hand figure above shows the percentage of CD3+ iNKT+ cells over a 21-day culture. The right-hand figure above shows an expansion-fold of CD3+iNKT+ T cells by our method.

18




​
We tested the transduction efficiency of our iNKT product by using a retroviral vector to transfer to the iNKTs the information to produce the anti-Isomeso CAR. As shown in the figure below, we show (A) a schematic diagram of anti-Isomeso CAR (clone 1B6), and (B) Retrovirus transduction efficiency of iNKTs with anti-Isomeso CAR (1B6) evaluated at five days post-transduction. Transduction efficiency was determined by flow cytometry staining of the CAR-embedded anti-CD34 epitope. Nontransduced (“NT”); transduced with CAR (1B6). In (C) we characterized iNKTs using the memory markers, CD62L and CD45RA, evidencing a central memory phenotype (CD45RA-CD62L+).
Our CAR iNKTs show sustained in vitro cytotoxicity against Iso-mesothelin-expressing tumor cells. (A) Day 3 imaging of human mesothelioma cell line (NCI-H226) co-cultured with various E/T ratios of iNKTs with or without anti-Iso MSLN CAR (pKB113) expression. (B) NCI-H226 tumor cell growth kinetics in the presence of CAR iNKTs. Data are analyzed using IncuCyte® S3 Live-Cell Analysis System. (C) Intracellular staining of Granzyme B and %iNKT+ Granzyme B+ cells in the co-culture.

​
In conclusion:

1. | our proprietary method of iNKT expansion yields a highly pure population of iNKTs (over 99% purity);
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | this approach has the potential to produce sufficient iNKTs for clinical and commercial scales; and
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | genetic modification of expanded iNKTs show high potential of eliminating tumor cells.

The central memory phenotype of our CAR iNKTs suggests that they could persist in vivo similarly to conventional CAR-T cells.

ABBIE Summary
ABBIE is a novel gene-editing system for inserting therapeutic genes safely into the genome of a host cell that will be incorporated into our off the shelf GDT therapy platform, which currently uses a retroviral methodology as noted above.
ABBIE technology comprises two main components, (i) a genome template (extracted from the ALEXIS plasmid), containing the therapeutic genes needed to retrain tumor-killing cells, and (ii) the gene-editing machinery required to safely insert this template into the genome of the therapeutic cells.
The ABBIE protein accompanies the CAR-containing genome template as it passes through the cell membrane into the nucleus and guides the template-flanking sequences (the "glue") safely into the target genome.
Due to this targeting ability, ABBIE can also be used to remove unwanted, inhibitory genes. CAR expression on the GDTs allows them to detect and destroy the antigen-expressing targeted cells.
ABBIE: Development
We are currently developing ABBIE (A Binding-Based Integrase Enzyme) for genetically engineering our product candidates. ABBIE is a non-viral gene-editing mechanism to insert the target DNA template information into the T cell genome at a predetermined locus. ABBIE allows for insertion of the genome template into the T cells so that they could express the CAR protein and other accessory proteins while possibly eliminating unwanted inhibitory proteins.
The non-viral vector template is simultaneously physically comingled with the patient's T cells or Natural Killer cells (“T or NK cells”). The non-viral vector transfers the target's genomic information into the T or NK cells, where it is integrated into the T or NK cell's genome. T or NK cells now have been reprogrammed with the genomic information for targeting and can successfully identify the targets on the cancer cells. This T or NK cell therapy is infused into the patient. T or NK cells will hunt down cancer cells with the known targets and destroy these cancer cells.
We believe that this gene delivery platform will deliver the DNA template to T or NK cell genomes at a lower cost and shorter timeframe versus a viral vector. By comparison, a retroviral vector would have a longer development lead time (~12 months) with an increased insertional mutagenesis risk. Insertional mutagenesis means that a random insertion of the DNA could activate uncontrolled cell growth. ABBIE allows for a more consistent expression and will have a shorter development lead time (3-6 months). It avoids unnecessary risks by targeting a single locus and produces more predictable cell-to-cell expression.
The development of ABBIE involves a multi-step process, which includes preparation of an integration-deficient lentivirus, a sensitive, targeted gene knock-out assay system, optimization of an inducible ABBIE protein expression system, a powerful screen for gene targeting efficiency, and a sensitive screen of additional ABBIE mutants to further improve efficacy. Altogether, the development plan involves construction of dozens of plasmid constructs, which are complete. To date, we have successfully completed the high transduction efficiency lentivirus system for our assays along with the non-integrating lentivirus system.

KiroVAX / BSK01
This was our Phase 1 cell therapy cancer vaccine candidate and consisted of professional antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells) which were matured and pulsed with tumor specific antigens, yielding a tumor-targeted, next-generation cellular therapy vaccine designed for the therapeutic treatment of multiple types of solid cancers. The trials terminated during fiscal year 2018 due to enrollment limitations. 
The scans in the picture below illustrate stable disease in a pancreatic cancer patient with lung metastasis which initially increased in size to 270mm2 and then subsequently stabilized at 100mm2 after three months of treatment with KiroVax/BSK01 in combination with chemotherapy, resulting in a progression free survival (PFS) of 7 months.

Although strategies have not yet been activated to advance the KiroVax/BSK01 platform, Kiromic is planning to leverage its clinical experience with BSK01 to develop an innovative technology aimed to boost the persistency of its allogenic cell therapy products.

Our Product Pipeline and Development
Using our proprietary technologies, we are researching and developing multiple product candidates for the treatment of solid tumors. Our product candidates are allogenic engineered GDTs to be used for specific patients as OTS treatments for patients with metastatic or progressive locally advanced solid malignancies.
Our product pipeline and clinical program projected timelines are represented in the diagrams below (clinical timelines and final patient accrual numbers are predicated upon FDA review and will be modified in accordance with FDA requirements):

Clinical Program
Not only is cancer the second leading cause of mortality worldwide, but 90% of cancer deaths are due to metastatic disease, with the remainder due primarily to locally advanced disease. Current treatments for locally advanced disease include systemic chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, but offer only limited benefit for many subjects with locally advanced disease that is not amendable to curative surgical resection. 
​
What makes this challenging is that solid tumors develop in complex and dynamic microenvironments that influence their growth, invasion, and metastasis. Therefore, effective novel therapies are needed for subjects with advanced solid tumors. 
​
The field of immunotherapy is currently expanding with a variety of approaches and Kiromic BioPharma’s suite of GDT therapies is uniquely positioned to make an impact in this setting based upon our promising preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies which have revealed strong and specific tumor cytotoxicity with minimal adverse effects.
​
As previously discussed, our INDs for ALEXIS-PRO-1 and ALEXIS-ISO-1 are currently on a clinical hold. Below is a graphic outlining our upcoming milestones to re-submit the IND applications and achieve a first in human dosing. The graphic is based on our current expectations, and consultations with our key vendors and stakeholders.

Our Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, as well as novel discoveries, product development technologies, and know-how.
Our commercial success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to develop and maintain protection of our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and applications related to our technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business.
We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, confidentiality agreements, and invention assignment agreements to develop and maintain our proprietary position. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and the invention assignment agreements are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed for us by our employees, consultants, or other third parties. We seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in our agreements and security measures, either may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently discovered by competitors.
With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of using and manufacturing the same.
Patents
We are actively building an intellectual property portfolio around our product candidates and our discovery programs, based on intellectual property we own as well as licensed intellectual property. We are the owners of, co-owners of, or the licensee of multiple patents and patent applications in the U.S. and worldwide. Our patent portfolio includes patent applications having claims directed to aspects of our lead product candidates, ALEXIS-PRO-1 and ALEXIS-ISO-1, as well as other research-stage candidates. Our patent portfolio and filing strategy is designed to provide multiple layers of protection by pursuing claims directed toward: (1) antigen binding domains directed to the targets of our product candidates; (2) CAR constructs used in our product candidates; (3) methods of treatment for therapeutic indications; (4) manufacturing processes; and (5) and methods for genetically engineering immune cells suitable for autologous and allogenic use.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the first non-provisional application to which priority is claimed. In the U.S., patent term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) in granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. In the U.S., the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for a patent term extension of up to five years under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which is designed to compensate for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The length of the patent term extension involves a complex calculation based on the length of time it takes for regulatory review. A patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug.
As of December 31, 2021, our patent estate includes five issued patents (four of which are in the U.S.) and 30 pending patent applications (eight of which are in the U.S.), each of which we either own, jointly own, or for which we have an exclusive commercial license (either in its entirety or within our field of use), as is more fully described below. Our patent families related to our product candidates are described below.

Our Research and Development Collaborations
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Grant
On April 8, 2021, we entered into a letter of intent (the “Letter of Intent”) with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (“MD Anderson”) pursuant to which MD Anderson shall receive a research grant from the Company titled, “Validation of biomarker isomeso for pancreatic cancer,” which is aimed at discovering new cancer-specific antigen targets (the “Grant”). The total costs to the Company to be paid in connection with the Grant was $300,000. Pursuant to the Letter of Intent, the Grant commenced on April 1, 2021 and was initially scheduled to end on March 31, 2022. The Company extended the Grant until March 31, 2023 at no additional cost.
Molipharma Agreement
On April 3, 2020, we entered into a joint venture agreement ("Joint Venture") with Molipharma, S.R.L. ("Molipharma") to collaborate in (1) a clinical trial program in oncology development ("Oncology") and (2) a clinical trial program in COVID-19 Vaccine ("COVID-19 Vaccine").
With respect to Oncology, we will grant a low single digit royalty to Molipharma for turnover of the marketing of ovarian cancer research in Europe. With respect to COVID-19 Vaccine, economic rights in Europe will transfer to Molipharma, and economic rights in the U.S. will transfer to us. Molipharma agreed to financially support the research program for COVID-19 and we agreed to financially support the research program in oncology. The Joint Venture has a duration of five years, extendable for a further five years, unless notice of non-renewal is sent one year before the expiration date. The parties may withdraw from the Joint Venture only for serious and justified reasons or by mutual consent.
Our Competition
Our products will compete with novel therapies developed by biopharmaceutical companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, in addition to standard of care treatments.
In 2017, two autologous anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapies, Kymriah, developed by Novartis International AG, and Yescarta, developed by Kite Pharma, Inc., were approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsing/remitting B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and relapsing/remitting large B cell lymphoma, respectively.
Due to the promising therapeutic effect of T cell therapies in clinical trials, we anticipate increasing competition from existing and new companies developing these therapies, as well as in the development of allogenic T cell therapies.
Potential cell therapy competitors include:
• Autologous T cell therapy competition:  Adaptimmune Therapeutics PLC, Amgen Inc., Autolus Therapeutics plc, bluebird, Gilead (acquired Kite), Novartis International AG, Celgene (acquired Juno), Tmunity Therapeutics, Inc. and Unum Therapeutics Inc.
• Allogenic T cell therapy competition:  Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc., Celyad S.A., CRISPR Therapeutics AG, Fate Therapeutics Inc., Intellia Therapeutics, Inc., Gilead (acquired Kite), Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., Poseida Therapeutics, Inc., Precision Biosciences, Inc., Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc., and Cytomed Therapeutics Pte, Ltd.
​
Competition will also arise from non-cell based immune and other pursued by small-cap biotechnology and large-cap pharmaceutical companies including Amgen Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Incyte Corporation, Merck & Co., Inc., and F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG. For instance, we may experience competition from companies, such as Amgen Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Xencor Inc., MacroGenics, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc and F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, that are pursuing bispecific antibodies, which target both the cancer antigen and TCR, thus bringing both cancer cells and T cells in close proximity to maximize the likelihood of an immune response to the cancer cells. Additionally, companies, such as Amgen Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc and Seattle Genetics, Inc., are pursuing 

30




antibody drug conjugates, which utilize the targeting ability of antibodies to deliver cell-killing agents directly to cancer cells.
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, pre-clinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, and marketing than we do. Future collaborations and mergers and acquisitions may result in further resource concentration among a smaller number of competitors.
Our commercial potential could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or make our development more complicated. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be efficacy, safety, and convenience.
These competitors may also vie for a similar pool of qualified scientific and management talent, sites and patient populations for clinical trials, as well as for technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.

This business has not generated any revenues for Kiromic However, it did generate $53,400 in other income during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Government Regulation
As a company that operates in the U.S., we are subject to extensive regulation. Biological products, such as our clinical trial candidates, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“the FDCA”), the Public Health Service Act (the “PHSA”), the FDA regulations under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), as well as other federal, state and local statutes and regulations.
Government authorities in the U.S. (at the federal, state and local level) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, safety, efficacy approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biopharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the U.S., although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
​

U.S. Product Development Process
In the U.S., the FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biological products under the FDCA, the PHSA, and their implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
​
• completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices (“GLPs”) and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals, such as the Animal Welfare Act, or other applicable regulations;
​
• submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
​
• approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced at that site;
​
• performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s good clinical practice requirements (“GCPs”), and any additional requirements for the protection of human research patients and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
​
• submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials, as well as detailed information about the chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and proposed labeling and packaging for the product candidate;
​
• consideration by an FDA Advisory Committee, if applicable;
​
• satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices (“cGTPs”) for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
​
• satisfactory completion of potential FDA audits of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
​
• FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA, including agreement on post-marketing commitments, if applicable.
​
Before testing any biological product candidate, including our product candidates, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs and the Animal Welfare Act. The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, 

32




the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on an IND at any time before or during clinical trials for a biological product candidate due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor's control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA's regulations and GCP requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of clinical trials, with the goals of assuring that the data and results are credible and accurate and that study participants’ rights, safety, and well-being are protected. GCP requirements also include the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Certain clinical trials involving human gene transfer research also must be overseen by an Institutional Biosafety Committee (“IBC”), a standing committee to provide peer review of the safety of research plans, procedures, personnel training and environmental risks of work involving recombinant DNA molecules. IBCs are typically assigned certain review responsibilities relating to the use of recombinant DNA molecules, including reviewing potential environmental risks, assessing containment levels, and evaluating the adequacy of facilities, personnel training, and compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board (“DSMB”), which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trials results to public registries.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
• Phase 1.  The biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety and to develop detailed profiles of its pharmacological and pharmacokinetic actions, determine side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, gain early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
•Phase 2.  The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
•Phase 3.  Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
​
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. During all phases of clinical development, regulatory 

33




agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human patients, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its DSMB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, including risks inferred from other unrelated immunotherapy trials. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Human immunotherapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of immunotherapy product candidates, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval.
Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional nonclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
The sponsor of a clinical trial or the sponsor’s designated responsible party may be required to register certain information about the trial and disclose certain results on government or independent registry websites, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, a manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug or, as applicable, 15 days after the drug receives a designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA submission must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended (“PDUFA”), each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. The PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems 

34




incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. FDA performance goals generally provide for action on a BLA within 10 months of the 60-day filing date, which would be within 12 months of its submission. That deadline can be extended under certain circumstances, including by the FDA’s requests for additional information. The targeted action date can also be shortened to six months of the 60-day filing date, or eight months after submission, for products that are granted priority review designation because they are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product's identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for consideration, discussion and a vote on specific questions relevant to the approval decision. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product.
A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include a medication guide, communication plan, or elements to assure safe use, such as required healthcare provider or pharmacy certification, a patient registry and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS, and the FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For immunotherapy products, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the GTPs, to the extent applicable. These are FDA regulations and guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissue, and cellular and tissue-based products (“HCT/Ps”), which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing.
Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant may take for the FDA to consider the application. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit 

35




the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product's safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the Pediatric Research Equity Act does not apply to any product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s).
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a fast-track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for development and review of new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for fast-track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. For a fast track-designated product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. Fast track designation may be rescinded if the FDA determines the program no longer meets the qualifying criteria for the fast-track program.
Any product, submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast-track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review, breakthrough therapy designation, and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if is intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review on a 6 month, rather than the standard 10-month, timeline. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a 

36




surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA requires as a condition for accelerated approval that promotional materials be submitted in advance of initial dissemination, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Breakthrough therapy designation is also intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening conditions. The designation by the FDA requires preliminary clinical evidence that a product candidate, alone or in combination with other drugs and biologics, demonstrates substantial improvement over currently available therapy on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough therapy designation comes with all of the benefits of fast-track designation, which means that the sponsor may file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with the FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review. Breakthrough Therapy designation may be rescinded if the FDA determines the program no longer meets the qualifying criteria for breakthrough therapy. Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”), designation was established by FDA in 2017 to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, any drug that meets the following criteria: (1) it qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (2) it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (3) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. RMAT designation provides potential benefits that may include more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate and eligibility for rolling review and priority review.
Products granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites. Once approved, when appropriate, the FDA can permit fulfillment of post-approval requirements under accelerated approval through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real-world evidence such as electronic health records; through the collection of larger confirmatory datasets; or through post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with the therapy prior to approval.
Breakthrough therapy designation is also intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening conditions. The designation by FDA requires preliminary clinical evidence that a product candidate, alone or in combination with other drugs and biologics, demonstrates substantial improvement over currently available therapy on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough therapy designation comes with all of the benefits of fast-track designation, which means that the sponsor may file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review.
Fast Track designation, priority review, RMAT and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products for which we receive FDA approvals will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product's approved uses (known as "off-label use"), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although a physician may prescribe a legally available product for an off-label use, if the physicians deem such product to be appropriate in his/her professional medical judgment, a manufacturer may not 

37




market or promote off-label uses. However, it is permissible to share in certain circumstances truthful and not misleading information that is consistent with the product's approved labeling.
In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product's approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures.
Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA's policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
​
U.S. Marketing Exclusivity
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (“BPCIA”) amended the PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly known as biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to establish its molecule as highly similar to an approved innovator biologic, among other requirements. This abbreviated approval pathway is intended to permit a biosimilar to come to market more quickly and less expensively by relying to some extent on the data generated by the reference product’s sponsor, and the FDA’s previous review and approval of the reference product. Under the BPCIA, a biosimilar sponsor’s ability to seek or obtain approval through the abbreviated pathway is limited by periods of exclusivity granted by the FDA to the holder of the reference product’s BLA. In general, no biosimilar application may be accepted by the FDA for review until 4 years after the date the reference product was first licensed by the FDA, and no biosimilar application, once accepted, may receive final approval until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents, if granted, may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years, as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.

38




Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued "Written Request" for such a trial.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the U.S., our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) (e.g., the Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments). For example, our business practices, including any future sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may be required to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the patient data privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), transparency requirements, and similar state, local and foreign laws, each as amended.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item, good, facility or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and other individuals and entities on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection.
Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Rather, if "one purpose" of the remuneration is to induce referrals, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is violated. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (discussed below).
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to, among others, a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for a medical or other item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes "any request or demand" for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies are being investigated or, in the past, have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies' marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.

39




HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements on covered entity health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, as well as their “business associates” – certain persons or covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a specified service or performing a function on behalf of a covered entity. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we may obtain health information from third parties that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, and other privacy and data security and consumer protection laws, and we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly receive individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA, and subject to other civil and/or criminal penalties if we obtain, use, or disclose information in a manner not permitted by other privacy and data security and consumer protection laws. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Many of the state laws enable a state attorney general to bring actions and provide private rights of action to consumers as enforcement mechanisms. There is also heightened sensitivity around certain types of health data, which may be subject to additional protections. The landscape of federal and state laws regulating personal data is constantly evolving, and compliance with these laws requires a flexible privacy framework and substantial resources, and compliance efforts will likely be an increasing and substantial cost in the future. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity. Federal regulators, state attorneys general, and plaintiffs’ attorneys have been active in this space.
The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) also sets expectations for failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure, or failing to provide a level of security commensurate to promises made to individual about the security of their personal information (such as in a privacy notice) may constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”). The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. With respect to privacy, the FTC also sets expectations that companies honor the privacy promises made to individuals about how the company handles consumers’ personal information; any failure to honor promises, such as the statements made in a privacy policy or on a website, may also constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of the FTC Act. While we do not intend to engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices, the FTC has the power to enforce promises as it interprets them, and events that we cannot fully control, such as data breaches, may be result in FTC enforcement. Enforcement by the FTC under the FTC Act can result in civil penalties or enforcement actions.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) annually report information to CMS related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, physicians and teaching hospitals and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place 

40




of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private "qui tam" actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the U.S., third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor's decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor's determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union (the “EU”), governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.

41




Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Healthcare Reform
In the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
For example, the Affordable Care Act has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers. Among the Affordable Care Act provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
• created an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs that began in 2011;
​
• increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price (“AMP”) for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the AMP;
​
• created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts, off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers' outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
​
• extended manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
​
• expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and added new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability;
​
• expanded the list of entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program;
​
• created a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
​
• expanded healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
​
• created a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;
​
• required reporting of certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;
​
• required annual reporting of certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
​

42




• established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending; and
​
• created a licensure framework for follow on biologic products.
​
There have been legal challenges and legislative changes to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, in December 2017, Congress repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax penalty for an individual's failure to maintain Affordable Care Act-mandated health insurance, commonly known as the "individual mandate", as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”).
​
Congress is continuing to consider legislation that would alter other aspects of the Affordable Care Act. The ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation on the U.S. healthcare industry is unclear. It is unclear how efforts to modify or challenge the Affordable Care Act or its implementing regulations, or portions thereof, will affect our business. Additional legislative and regulatory changes, and further judicial challenges, related to the Affordable Care Act remain possible. Any such changes or challenges could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates.
We anticipate that the Affordable Care Act, if substantially maintained in its current form, will continue to result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
Further legislation or regulation could be adopted that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of, on average, 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislation, will stay in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020, through May 31, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The law provides for 1% Medicare sequestration in the second quarter of 2022 and allows the full 2% sequestration thereafter until 2030. To offset the temporary suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2030, the sequestration will be 2.25% for the first half of the year, and 3% in the second half of the year. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative, regulatory and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to specialty and other drug pricing practices. Among other things, there have been several U.S. Congressional inquiries and federal and state legislative and regulatory activity designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare and other government programs, examine the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, at the federal level, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019. Congress and the U.S. President's administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including those regarding price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Additional Regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use. The General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) applies extraterritorially, and we may be subject to the GDPR because of our data processing activities that involve the personal data of individuals located in the EU, such as in connection with our EU clinical trials. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states may result in fines of up to €20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to the personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new data protection rules.
The GDPR imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data. In particular, these obligations and restrictions concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the sharing of personal data with third parties, the transfer of personal data out of the EU, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data and imposition of substantial potential fines for violations of the data protection obligations. Specifically regarding the transfer of personal data outside of the EU, while there are legal mechanisms available to lawfully transfer personal data outside of the EU, including to the United States, there are certain unsettled legal issues regarding such data transfers, the resolution of which may adversely affect our ability to transfer personal data or otherwise may cause us to incur significant costs to come into compliance with applicable data transfer impact assessments and implementation of legal data transfer mechanisms. On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled the EU-US Privacy Shield to be an invalid data transfer mechanism and confirmed that the Model Clauses remain valid, and in June 2021, the European Commission published updated versions of the Model Clauses, which must be incorporated into new and existing agreements within prescribed timeframes in order to continue to lawfully transfer personal data outside of the EU. Data protection authorities from the different EU member states, as well as in the United Kingdom and Switzerland, have promulgated national privacy laws that impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing and transferring EU personal data, with the United Kingdom and Switzerland following the EU with the publication of new Model Clauses to be incorporated in all applicable contracts within a specified timeframe in order to legitimize data transfers from those jurisdictions. Our ability to continue to transfer personal data outside of the EU, United Kingdom, or Switzerland may become significantly more costly and may subject us to increased scrutiny and liability under the GDPR or similar local laws, and we may experience operating disruptions if we are unable to conduct these transfers in the future. 
California Consumer Privacy Act
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA and its implementing regulations have already been amended multiple times since their enactment. In November 2020, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) ballot initiative which introduced significant amendments to the CCPA and established and funded a dedicated California privacy regulator, the California Privacy Protection Agency (“CPPA”). The amendments introduced by the CPRA go into effect on January 1, 2023, and new implementing regulations are expected to be introduced by the CPPA. Failure to 

44




comply with the CCPA may result in, among other things, significant civil penalties and injunctive relief, or potential statutory or actual damages. In addition, California residents have the right to bring a private right of action in connection with certain types of incidents. These claims may result in significant liability and potential damages. We implemented processes to manage compliance with the CCPA and continue to assess the impact of the CPRA, and other state legislation, on our business as additional information and guidance becomes available. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations or limitations in the area of consumer protection. These laws and regulations are evolving and may impose limitations on our business activities. The obligations to comply with new privacy laws may require us, among other things, to update our notices and develop new processes internally and with our service providers to facilitate consumer rights requests, and such laws may impose restrictions on our processing of personal information that may impact the way we operate our business. We may be subject to fines, penalties, or private actions in the event of non-compliance with such laws. .
Human Capital
Our Employees. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 59 employees. Of the 59 employees, 58 employees were employed in the U.S. of America with one employee employed in Italy. Our highly qualified and experienced team includes scientists, physicians, laboratory technicians, finance professionals, and administrative professionals. We also utilize a number of consultants for financial reporting, clinical, regulatory, and SEC compliance.
We believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees, and we have not experienced any significant labor disputes or any difficulty in recruiting staff for our operations. None of our employees is represented by a labor union.
Employee Engagement, Talent Development & Benefits. We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, and opportunities for equity ownership.
Diversity, Inclusion, and Culture. Much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce. We believe that our business benefits from the different perspectives a diverse workforce brings, and we pride ourselves on having a strong, inclusive and positive culture based on our shared mission and values.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time in the future, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. On March 22, 2021, Jason Terrell (“Terrell”), a former consultant for and director of the Company, commenced an action against us in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, C.A. No. 2021-0248-MTZ (the “Action”). In the Action, Terrell seeks a declaratory judgment that we are obligated to issue him (i) options to purchase 500,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.50 per share pursuant to an alleged 2014 consulting agreement, and (ii) options to purchase an additional 500,005 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.17 per share pursuant to an alleged January 2017 non-employee director options agreement. In his Complaint, Terrell also claimed that, pursuant to our operative certificate of incorporation, he is entitled to indemnification from us for attorneys’ fees and costs he incurs in connection with the Action because the Action arises in connection with his position as a former director. 
​
We dispute Terrell’s claims and allegations in the Action and intends to vigorously defend against them. On May 21, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss Terrell’s claims in the actions with prejudice, arguing that (i) Terrell’s options-related claims fail because his 2014 and January 2017 agreements were explicitly superseded by a later options agreement, under which Terrell relinquished his prior options; and (ii) Terrell is not entitled to indemnification because the Action relates to contracts between the Company and Terrell in his personal capacity, and not in connection with any activities or duties of Terrell in his official capacity as former director.  In response to the motion, filed on June 21, 2021, Terrell withdrew his claim for indemnification, but opposed the portion seeking dismissal of his declaratory judgment claim.  The motion was fully briefed with the filing of our reply brief on July 7, 2021.
​
Oral argument was held before the Vice Chancellor on October 20, 2021.  During oral argument, the Vice Chancellor invited the parties to submit supplemental letter briefs on the question of whether the Court of Chancery even had the authority to adjudicate the Action in light of the delegation of authority in Terrell’s most recent stock option agreement 

45




with the Company (the “SOA”) to our Compensation Committee to resolve all disputes regarding the interpretation of the SOA.  The parties submitted simultaneous supplemental letters briefs on this issue on November 15, 2021.  On January 20, 2022, the Vice Chancellor issued her decision on our motion to dismiss, ruling that the Action is stayed until the Compensation Committee itself resolves whether it has sole authority to resolve the parties’ contract interpretation dispute.
​
The parties are currently in discussions to coordinate submissions and/or presentations to the Compensation Committee.  In the interim, as noted, the Action is stayed, and no further proceedings are taking place.
Sabby Volatility Warrant Master Fund Ltd., et al. v. Kiromic BioPharma, Inc. et al., Case No. 22-cv-1927 (SDNY). On March 7, 2022, entities related to Sabby Management LLC (the “Sabby Entities”) and Empery Asset Management, LP (the “Empery Entities”) filed a complaint in the District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging claims against the Company and certain current and former officers and directors of Kiromic for alleged violations of Sections 11, 12, and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with the purchase of common stock through the Company’s public offering that closed on July 2, 2021. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages; rescission to the extent they still hold Kiromic securities, or if sold, rescissory damages; reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ and experts’ fees; and other unspecified equitable and injunctive relief. The Company expects to vigorously defend against this action. The Company has evaluated that it is reasonably possible that the Sabby Entities’ and Empery Entities’ claims may result in an estimated loss ranging between $0 and $8,100,000. Similarly, the Company has evaluated that it is reasonably possible that other unasserted claims in future litigation and losses may occur. However, the Company is unable to estimate any possible range of loss attributed to other unasserted claims at this time. 
In addition to the above, several class action plaintiff law firms have issued press releases announcing that the firms are investigating securities law claims on behalf of stockholders of the Company. These press releases were in response to an approximately 15% decline in the Company’s stock price on July 16, 2021, the date we had first announced we had received comments from the FDA on our two INDs, resulting in clinical holds. If claims are ultimately made pursuant to these investigations or otherwise, we intend to defend ourselves vigorously, but are unable to predict the outcome of any such litigation. Even if we are successful, securities litigation is costly to defend and would likely divert management’s attention away from the business. To the extent that we are subject to a legal proceeding, it could have a material adverse impact on us.
We are not currently party to any other legal proceedings that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.
​
Overseas Government Regulation
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country's national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial application is approved in accordance with a country's requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the U.S. is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In 

46




all cases, again, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
EU General Data Protection Regulation
In addition to EU regulations related to the approval and commercialization of our products, we may be subject to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR. The GDPR imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data of persons in the EU, including, for example, more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to special categories of data, such as health data, and additional obligations when we contract with third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the U.S. and other third countries. In addition, the GDPR provides that EU member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of personal data, including genetic, biometric or health data.
