Item 1. Business
Company Overview
Medidata is a global life sciences technology provider, dedicated to improving the way clinical research is designed, conducted, analyzed, and commercialized. Our cloud-based platform of solutions, data analytics, and AI enables efficiency and improves quality throughout clinical development programs by accelerating processes, enhancing decision-making, minimizing operational risk, reducing costs, and transforming trial strategies.
Customers can utilize our entire platform or individual solutions, and can subscribe to our technology on a multi-study or single-study basis. Our revenue is comprised of subscription and professional services, which represent approximately 85% and 15% of our business, respectively. Our subscription business model provides us with a recurring revenue stream that we believe delivers greater revenue visibility than perpetual software licensing models.
Our Platform: The Medidata Cloud
The Medidata Cloud is the Intelligent Platform for Life Sciences, transforming clinical development and converting complex data into cutting-edge insights. It provides a unified platform for demonstrating treatment efficacy and safety, supporting regulatory approval, achieving peak revenue faster, improving outcomes for patients, providers, and payers, and paving the way for the increasingly more precise therapies of the future.
It Starts With Data Capture and Management
Our data capture, management, and reporting family of solutions is the cornerstone of the Medidata Cloud. Our technology captures data and patient feedback throughout the life cycle of a clinical trial.
Rich Data Capture Leads to Pioneering Analytics
Captured data goes on to inform the Medidata Enterprise Data Store ("MEDS") and AI family of solutions. MEDS and AI combine the industry's largest set of de-identified clinical data with the customer's own data to provide immediate metrics and benchmarking; use omics data and machine learning algorithms to detect quality issues and identify correlations in captured data; provide powerful and intuitive cross-study reporting capabilities; and enable customers to leverage historical controls from statistically similar indications and studies through synthetic control arm and synthetic control data solutions.
Pioneering Analytics Accelerates Trial Planning and Management
MEDS and AI power the trial planning and management family of solutions, which provides clinical operations capabilities. At the trial planning stage, study design, site feasibility, and grants budgeting and management tools leverage data from MEDS to optimize trial design, site selection, and budgeting. For ongoing trial management, our technology provides risk assessment and anomaly detection; regulated content creation, storage, and collaboration; and automation of site payments.
SHYFT Adds Commercial and Real-World Analytics
The SHYFT family of solutions provides actionable insights into sales activities, market composition and dynamics, and real-world patient outcomes to drive peak commercial performance.

• | Ongoing support. We take a consultative approach to ensure quality study design, ease of use, and productivity throughout the project life cycle. We have certified experts available to manage our customers' operational needs and ensure they are gaining maximum value from the Medidata platform within their unique environments.

Our Strategy
Our goal is to enable our customers to bring their new and enhanced medical treatments to the public quickly and safely and to enable them to successfully market these treatments by providing a platform that uses innovative technology to automate, streamline, support, and enhance clinical development activities. Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Expand the number of products used by our existing customers. We refer to this footprint, measured by the number of Medidata products used by each of our customers, as "density." We seek to improve our density by demonstrating the significant efficiencies that our customer base can achieve by standardizing end-to-end clinical development and commercialization processes on our platform and by leveraging more of our solutions.


• | Increase the level of product usage by existing customers. We refer to the level of usage of Medidata products that are already deployed by customers as "intensity." In cases where customers utilize our solutions for only a subset of their clinical trial activities, we seek to drive usage across more trials, therapeutic areas, geographies, and phases, and to convert single-study customers to multi-study customers.


• | Continuously improve our platform. We continue to enhance our platform with regular releases, adding new functionality, integrations, and user benefits.


• | Develop additional innovative technologies and services. We continue to build new innovative solutions that further transform the clinical development and commercialization process, and offer them to new and existing customers. We continue to develop our analytics and benchmarking capabilities, creating value for our customers by improving decision-making.


• | Grow indirect sales partnership initiatives. We pursue strategic partnerships with channel partners, such as contract research organizations ("CROs") and systems integrators, to position the Medidata Cloud as the platform of choice for their outsourced clinical trial management services. Our well-established program of support, training, and certification enables partners to cost-effectively implement our solutions and services in sponsor studies as they provide their other services related to pharmaceutical development.


• | Position the Medidata Cloud as a key player in the evolving clinical ecosystem. We seek opportunities for collaborative innovation, building strategic relationships with other leading technology and data firms. Partnerships enable us to enhance and complement our portfolio of offerings and achieve greater scale in the marketplace while helping to drive the evolution of life sciences.


• | Expand our global customer base. We have offices in 7 countries and serve customers in over 30 countries. We will continue to expand our sales, marketing, technology, and support resources into new markets around the world where clinical development activity is accelerating.

Research and Development
We believe that our future success depends on our ability to continue to enhance and broaden the Medidata Cloud to meet the evolving needs of our current and future customers. Equally important is our ability to innovate, taking advantage of latest technologies and trends in life sciences. Our efforts are focused both on developing new, complementary technologies and on enhancing the existing solutions in our platform. Our research and development organization includes product managers that work with both internal and customer experts to plan new features and functionality; software project managers that oversee development teams and timeline; product engineers, data scientists, and user experience designers that build the technical components of our platform; and software quality assurance and technical documentation specialists that deliver a validated final product to our customers.
Sales and Marketing 
Our sales and marketing efforts focus on enhancing the global recognition and reputation of our brand, increasing consideration of and preference for our platform and professional services, and generating qualified sales leads. We market and sell our cloud-based solutions through a direct sales force and through relationships with channel and strategic partners, focusing efforts on key executives and decision makers within our existing and prospective customer base.
Our direct sales force operates globally and is organized by both region and focus area. Sales through this direct channel currently represent the largest source of our total revenues.
Many sponsors of clinical trials outsource some or all of their clinical research activities as a means of expanding capacity, controlling costs, and focusing on core strengths. Our relationships with channel partners, such as CROs and systems integrators, help position the Medidata Cloud as the platform of choice for these sponsors' outsourced services. We train, certify, and support our partners on our solutions, enabling them to quickly and cost-effectively implement our technology in sponsors' studies.

Customers
We serve pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and diagnostics companies, institutions (which include academic research centers, government, and other non-profit organizations), CROs, and other entities engaged in conducting and/or sponsoring clinical trials and commercializing treatments. These customers range in size from the smallest of start-ups to the largest of global pharmaceutical companies. As of December 31, 2018, we had over one thousand customers.
We sell our solutions and provide services globally. Approximately 25%, 23%, and 23% of our revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, were derived from international operations. A summary of our domestic and international disaggregated revenues is set forth in Note 3, "Revenues," to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our five largest customers accounted for 22%, 26%, and 26% of our revenues in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, no one customer comprised 10% or more of our total accounts receivable.
Backlog
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our total multi-year subscription backlog was $1,170 million and $1,036 million, respectively.
Total subscription backlog increases with the addition of new customer contracts, customer renewals, and contract modifications. It decreases with the recognition of revenue or contract modifications. The timing and duration of new contracts, renewals, contract modifications, and revenue recognition are variable and are not comparable year to year. Total subscription backlog is typically highest at the beginning of a contract and approaches zero prior to renewal. The level of total backlog is not an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue of that contract. The amount of total backlog associated with an existing multi-year contract may significantly vary year to year solely based on the status of renewal and have no significant impact on the amount of revenue attributable to that contract in a year-over-year comparison. Additionally, large multi-study deals may include provisions under which the customer contracts for a smaller amount of subscription services as they start the contract and the amount ramps up over the life of the contract; the result is an initial large increase in total subscription backlog that does not equate to a proportional increase in revenue in the subsequent period.
We also calculate a 12-month subscription backlog, which represents the future contract value of outstanding multi-study and single study arrangements, billed and unbilled, to be recognized in the next 12 months, excluding expected intra-year renewals and other adjustments. As of January 1, 2019 and 2018, we had 12-month subscription backlog of approximately $522 million and $446 million, respectively. We believe that 12-month subscription backlog is more easily reconciled to future revenues to be recognized than total backlog, and therefore is a more valuable metric for evaluation of expected future revenues.
Our presentation of backlog may differ from that of other companies in our industry.
Technology and Support Infrastructure
We have designed our platform to maximize ease of use, flexibility, data visibility, and scalability. Our solutions are deployed through the use of industry-standard web browsers and mobile devices, service-oriented architectures, three-tiered server architectures, or a web server, a proprietary application server, and a database server. End users can access our solutions through any web browser from anywhere in the world without downloading or installing any Medidata-specific software. We develop our solutions on a broad base of technologies, including Java, Scala, .NET, Ruby, Python, R, SQL Server, Business Objects, AWS, Chef, VMWare, and others. We utilize technologies such as firewalls, intrusion detection, and encryption, along with security monitoring, to ensure the privacy and security of our customers' data.
We manage a hybrid cloud, operating our solutions on a combination of private data center and public cloud. Monitoring services are provided on a 24/7 basis by trained Medidata staff to ensure consistent delivery and availability. Advanced backup and storage frameworks, regionally-diverse data centers, and trained engineering teams are in place to provide for quick reaction time in the event of a disaster.
We offer 24/7 support to our end users through a global array of multi-lingual help desks.
Competition
The market for clinical trial solutions is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. It is subject to continually changing technology, shifting customer needs, changes in laws and regulations, and frequent introductions of new products and services. The competitive landscape is intensified by new entrants and start-ups that bring a broad range of new solutions and offerings to the health care technology market.
In general, our competitors include a variety of entities such as information, analytics, technology and services companies, as well as in-house technologies developed by our clients. Our platform competes with firms such as BioClinica, Inc., IQVIA (formerly Quintiles IMS), Oracle, IBM (Clinical Development; Watson Group and/or Watson Health), Parexel Informatics, Veeva Systems, Inc. and other large-scale technology providers that offer a range of products and services that compete with Medidata's solutions. In the future, we may also compete with horizontal cloud-based providers that build platforms that support life sciences customers. On a product-by-product basis, we also compete with a number of vendors offering applications and systems competitive with Medidata in 
4

specific areas, such as eResearch Technology, Inc., CRF Health, Bracket, DataTrak International, Inc., Medrio, Inc., Merge Healthcare (an IBM Company), and OmniComm Systems, Inc.
We compete on the basis of several factors, including the following:

• | innovation, breadth and depth of solution offerings;


• | data privacy and security infrastructure;


• | strategic partnerships with other companies in the life sciences and technology industries;


• | platform capabilities and solution functionality and features, including analytics;


• | workforce skill set;


• | scalability and upgrade pathways and support;


• | speed, performance, and ease of use of our solutions;


• | product reliability and infrastructure accessibility and security;


• | regulatory compliance;


• | breadth and strength of partnerships;


• | interoperability;


• | financial stability;


• | depth of expertise and quality of our global professional services and customer support; and


• | sales and marketing capabilities, including the ability to create and communicate operational value.

Although some of our competitors and potential competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more product offerings, and greater financial, technological, and other resources than we do, we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors and that the significant regulatory and industry expertise required for the development of life sciences solutions may hinder newer or less established participants in the market.
Intellectual Property
Our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We rely upon a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. In addition, we protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality, non-competition, and assignment of inventions agreements. We have registered trademarks and service marks in the United States ("U.S.") and abroad, and filed applications for the registration of additional trademarks and service marks. Our principal trademarks are “Medidata,” "Medidata Solutions," "Medidata Clinical Cloud," "Medidata Patient Cloud," "Rave," and "Architecture of Hope." We also hold several domain names, including the domain names "medidata.com," “mdsol.com,” and “medidatasolutions.com.” As of December 31, 2018, we hold 33 patents as well as numerous published patent applications outstanding in the U.S. and certain foreign countries.
The legal protections described above afford only limited protection for our technology. Due to rapid technological change, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product and service developments, and enhancements to existing products and services are more important than the various legal protections of our technology to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position.
Government and Other Regulations
Regulation of Clinical Trials and Electronic Systems Used in Clinical Trials
The conduct of clinical trials is subject to regulation and regulatory guidance associated with the approval of new drugs, biological products and medical devices imposed upon the clinical trial process by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency ("PDMA") in Japan, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ("MHRA") in the United Kingdom, the European Medicines Agency ("EMA") in EU/EEA, and other foreign governmental regulatory agencies and international non-governmental organizations, such as the International Conference on Harmonisation ("ICH").
The laws, regulations, and guidance from various countries and regions are often, but not always, harmonized. In those areas that are not yet harmonized, conflicting or even contradictory requirements may exist. Further, the regulatory environment and requirements for clinical trials and drug/biologic/device approvals are undergoing rapid change in the U.S., the European Union ("EU") (including the anticipated implementation of the new Regulation EU No. 536/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC) and other areas. We continue to monitor regulatory developments and industry best practices in these areas and make changes and introduce improvements as necessary to remain in compliance. In addition, the uncertainties around the United Kingdom's anticipated 2019 exit from the EU, as well as the move to the EMA from London to Amsterdam, may impact regulatory operations (including the development of new guidance) and the life sciences industry.
The use of our software products, services, and hosted solutions by customers engaged in clinical trials must be done in a manner that is compliant with a complex array of laws and regulations. Our applications have been designed to allow our customers to deploy such clinical trials as part of a validated, fit-for-purpose system, compliant with applicable laws and regulations.

The use of software during the clinical trial process must adhere to the regulations and regulatory guidance known as Good Clinical Practice ("GCP"), guidance documents, and other various codified practices such as the Consolidated Guidance for Industry from the ICH Regarding Good Clinical Practices for Europe, the Asia Pacific region, and the Americas. The current amendment (ICH E6(R2)) encourages sponsors to implement improved oversight and management of clinical trials, while continuing to ensure protection of human subjects participating in trials and clinical trial data integrity. 
In addition to these regulations and guidance documents, regulatory authorities have developed regulations and regulatory guidance concerning electronic records and electronic signatures. In general, regulatory guidance stipulates that computerized systems used to capture or manage clinical trial data must meet certain standards for attributability, legibility, contemporaneousness, originality, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and availability, as well as integrity and security. If our customers violate GCP or other regulatory requirements, both parties may run the risk that the violation will result in a regulatory citation, the suspension of the clinical trial, investigator disqualification or debarment, the rejection or withdrawal of a product marketing application, criminal prosecution, or civil penalties. Such risks not only impact our customers, but could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
Regulation of Health Information
Government regulation of the use and disclosure of subject (patient) privacy and data protection imposes a number of requirements. In the U.S., regulations issued pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") require certain “covered entities,” including facilities and providers that are involved in clinical trials, to comply with established standards regarding the privacy and security of protected health information, and to use standardized code sets when conducting certain electronic transactions. The regulations also require “business associates” that provide services on behalf of the covered entity to follow the same standards. Although we are not a “covered entity” or a “business associate,” and therefore technically are not subject to HIPAA regulations, many users of our products and services are directly regulated under HIPAA and our products cannot be utilized in a manner that is inconsistent with the users' HIPAA compliance requirements. In addition, to the extent we perform functions or activities on behalf of customers that are directly regulated by such health-related privacy laws, we may be required to comply with a number of the same HIPAA requirements. The breach of such requirements on our part may result in liability to our customers and us. In addition to HIPAA, most states within the U.S. have enacted or are considering their own privacy and data protection laws. Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements and we must comply with them as well.
In addition to complying with the privacy laws in the U.S., many foreign governments have data privacy and data protection laws that include additional protections for customer end-user information and for sensitive patient information, including clinical data. Because our services are available to customers in many foreign countries and to domestic customers using our services for multinational clinical trials, we must provide our services in a manner that supports our customers' compliance obligations. Foreign government data protection laws and regulations include the General Data Protection Regulation ("Regulation (EU) 2016/679" or the "GDPR"), and European country-specific laws and regulations that implement or will implement the GDPR, as well as the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 1,998 employees, of which 1,560 were located in the U.S., 252 in Europe, and 186 in the Asia Pacific region. As of December 31, 2018, we had 238 employees in customer services, support, and delivery, 348 employees in professional services, 744 employees in research and development, 420 employees in sales and marketing, and 248 employees in administrative and corporate functions. We also retain additional outside contractors to supplement our services and research and development staff on an as-needed basis. As of December 31, 2018, we had 599 independent contractors, the majority of which have been engaged in connection with help desk, customer service, and software development functions. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
