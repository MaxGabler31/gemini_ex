ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Founded in 1983, Chico’s FAS, Inc.1, is a leading omnichannel specialty retailer of women's private branded, sophisticated, casual-to-dressy apparel, intimates and complementary accessories. We operate under the Chico's, White House Black Market ("WHBM") and Soma brand names. As of February 2, 2019, we operated 1,418 stores across 46 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada, and sold merchandise through 83 international franchise locations in Mexico. Our distinct lifestyle brands serve the needs of fashion-savvy women 35 years and older. We earn revenue and generate cash through the sale of merchandise in our domestic and international retail stores, our various Company-operated e-commerce websites, our call center (which takes orders for all of our brands), through an unaffiliated franchise partner in Mexico and through third-party channels. We view our stores and e-commerce websites as a single, integrated sales function rather than as separate sales channels operating independently. 
We offer high quality and unique merchandise, supported by compelling marketing and outstanding personalized customer service. While each of our brands has a distinct customer base, the overall portfolio caters to a broad age and economic demographic, with household incomes in the moderate to high income level.
Our fiscal years end on the Saturday closest to January 31 and are designated by the calendar year in which the fiscal year commences. The periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the fiscal years ended February 2, 2019 (“fiscal 2018”, “2018” or “current period”), February 3, 2018 (“fiscal 2017”, “2017” or “prior period”), January 28, 2017 (“fiscal 2016” or “2016”), January 30, 2016 (“fiscal 2015” or “2015”) and January 31, 2015 (“fiscal 2014” or “2014”). Each of these periods had 52 weeks, except for fiscal 2017, which consisted of 53 weeks. 
Our Brands
The Company's brands, described in more detail below, are organized into three operating segments and aggregated into one reportable segment due to the similarities of the economic and operating characteristics of the brands.
Chico’s
Our Chico’s brand began operations in 1983 and primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded clothing focusing on women 45 and older. The style sensibility is unique with an individual expression created to illuminate the women wearing the brand. Chico's apparel, including the Black Label, Zenergy and Travelers collections, emphasizes problem solving styles, comfort and relaxed fit. Accessories and jewelry are original and designed to elevate the clothing assortment, allowing our customer to individualize her personal style. 
The distinctive nature of Chico’s clothing is also reflected in its sizing, which is comprised of sizes 000, 00 (size 0-2), 0 (size 4-6), 1 (size 8-10), 2 (size 12-14), 3 (size 16-18) and 4 (size 20-22). Chico’s will occasionally offer half-sizes (up to 3.5), one-size-fits-all, petite sizes, short and tall inseams, and small, medium and large sizing for some items. The relaxed fit allows us to utilize this kind of sizing and thus offer a wide selection of clothing without investing in a large number of sizes within a single style.
Chico's is vertically integrated, controlling almost all aspects of the apparel design process, including choices of pattern, print, construction, design specifications, fabric, finishes and color through in-house designers, purchased designs and independent suppliers.

White House Black Market
The WHBM brand began operations in 1985 and was acquired by the Company in September 2003. WHBM is dedicated to being a go-to style destination and authority on wardrobe building. WHBM primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded clothing focusing on women 35 and older. WHBM offers a modern collection to support her every lifestyle moment, selling stylish and versatile clothing and accessory items, including everyday basics, polished casual apparel, relaxed workwear, black and white pieces, and feminine all-occasion dresses. The accessories at WHBM, such as shoes, belts, scarves, handbags and jewelry, are specifically designed to coordinate with each collection, allowing customers to easily individualize their wardrobe selections. 
WHBM uses American sizes in the 00-14 range (with online sizes up to 16), including petite sizing, as well as short and long inseams, and small, medium and large sizing for some items. The fit of the WHBM clothing is tailored to complement the figure of a body-conscious woman, while still remaining comfortable.
WHBM is vertically integrated, controlling almost all aspects of the apparel design process, including choices of patterns, prints, construction, design specifications, fabric, finishes and color through in-house designers, purchased designs and independent suppliers.
Soma
The Soma brand, which began operations in 2004, primarily sells exclusively designed, private branded lingerie, sleepwear and loungewear products focusing on women who want solutions as comfortable as they are beautiful. The Soma brand's core franchises emphasize innovative styles that focus on fit and uncompromising comfort, including vanishing back bras, vanishing edge panties, slimming leggings and cool nights sleepwear. 
Bras range in size from 32A-46H. The sleepwear and loungewear offerings range in size from extra small to extra-extra-large. 
The Soma team develops product offerings by working closely with a small number of independent suppliers to design proprietary products in-house and, in some cases, designs provided by its independent suppliers under labels other than the Soma brand.
Our Business Strategy
Our overall business strategy is focused on building a collection of distinct high-performing retail brands serving the fashion needs of women 35 and older. We seek to accomplish this strategy through our five focus areas: (1) evolving the customer experience, (2) strengthening our brands' positions, (3) leveraging actionable retail science, (4) building growth platforms and (5) achieving operational excellence. Over the long term, we may build our brand portfolio by organic development or acquisition of other specialty retail concepts if research indicates that the opportunity complements our current brands and is appropriate and in the best interest of the shareholders.
We pursue improving the performance of our brands by building our omnichannel capabilities, managing our store base, growing our online presence, executing marketing plans, effectively leveraging expenses, considering additional sales channels and markets, and optimizing the merchandise offerings of each of our brands. We continue to invest heavily in our omnichannel capabilities so our customers can fully experience our brands in the manner they choose.
We view our stores and e-commerce websites as a single, integrated sales function rather than as separate, independently operated sales channels. As a result, we maintain a shared inventory platform for our operations, allowing us to fulfill orders for all channels from our distribution center ("DC") in Winder, Georgia. Our domestic customers can return merchandise to a store or to our DC, regardless of the original purchase location. Using our enhanced “Locate” tool, we ship in-store orders from other locations directly to the customer, expediting delivery times while reducing our shipping costs. In addition, we expanded our omnichannel capabilities in fiscal 2018 with the launch of Endless Aisle, our shared inventory system, enabling customers to purchase online and ship from store.
We seek to acquire new customers and retain existing customers by leveraging existing customer-specific data and through targeted marketing, including digital marketing, social media, television, catalogs and mailers. We seek to optimize the potential of our brands with improved product offerings, potential new merchandise opportunities, and brand extensions that enhance the current offerings, as well as through our continued emphasis on our trademark “Most Amazing Personal Service” standard. We also will continue to consider potential alternative sales channels for our brands, including international franchise, wholesale, licensing and other opportunities.

In fiscal 2016, we implemented cost reduction and operating efficiency initiatives, including realigning marketing and digital commerce, improving supply chain efficiency and reducing non-merchandise expenses. In fiscal 2017, we focused on our brand positioning and evolving the customer experience and leveraging actionable retail science to drive sales. In fiscal 2018, we launched multiple initiatives that utilize technology and new platforms to drive growth such as Endless Aisle and Style ConnectTM (which enables store associates to personalize the customer experience). As a result of these multi-year initiatives, we have the technology and tools in place to leverage our omnichannel capabilities, which should allow us to capture and stay connected with our customers, whether in-store or online. 
We are committed to enhancing our effectiveness and efficiency to better meet customer expectations and drive profitable growth. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we announced a retail fleet optimization plan to rebalance the mix between our physical store presence and our digital network with the closure of at least 250 stores in the United States over the next three years. Building upon management's strategic decision to right-size our retail fleet, we also commenced a comprehensive review of our operations to ensure the business is structured for agility, speed and innovation. These initiatives are part of the Company's efforts to better capitalize on its omnichannel platform, reduce costs, improve profitability and return on invested capital. 
Our Customer Service Model
We strive to deliver outstanding and personalized customer service to our customers through our trademark “Most Amazing Personal Service” standard. We believe this service model is one of our competitive advantages and a key to our continued success. An important aspect to the successful implementation of this model involves specialized training we provide our sales associates to help them better meet their customers’ fashion and wardrobe needs. Such needs may include clothing and accessory style, color selection, coordination of complete outfits and suggestions on different ways to wear the clothing and accessories. Our sales associates are encouraged to develop long-term relationships with their customers, to know their customers’ preferences and to assist our customers in selecting merchandise best suited to their tastes and wardrobe needs. Our brands utilize Style Connect to access customer purchase history and style preferences as a clienteling tool that enhances the shopping experience in a personalized and efficient manner. 
We also serve our customers’ needs and build customer loyalty through our customer rewards programs. Our programs are designed to reward our loyal customers by leveraging the rich data our customers share with us to deliver a relevant and engaging experience with our brands. The benefits provided are routinely evaluated in conjunction with our overall customer relationship management and marketing activities to ensure they remain a compelling reason for customers to shop at our brands.

Our Boutiques and Outlet Stores
Our boutiques are located in upscale indoor shopping malls, outdoor shopping areas and standalone street-front locations in the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada. Boutique locations are determined based on various factors, including, but not limited to: market and demographic characteristics, nearby competitors, our own network of existing boutiques, the location of the shopping venue, including the site within the shopping center, proposed lease terms, anchor or other co-tenants, parking accommodations and convenience. Our merchandise is also sold through international franchise locations in Mexico, including boutique locations as well as shop-in-shop formats within a department store environment. 
Our outlet stores are primarily located in quality outlet centers. The Chico’s and WHBM brand outlets contain a mixture of made-for-outlet and clearance merchandise. The made-for-outlet product carries a higher margin than the clearance items from our boutique stores. Soma outlets contain a mix of boutique and clearance merchandise. We also sell clearance merchandise on our websites. We regularly review the appropriate ratio of made-for-outlet and clearance merchandise sold at our outlets and adjust that ratio as appropriate.

Under our retail fleet optimization plan, we expect to close approximately 100 Chico’s, 90 White House Black Market and 60 Soma locations over the next three years, with the majority of the closings occurring in years two and three. We continuously evaluate the appropriate store base in light of economic conditions and our business strategy and may adjust the openings and closures as conditions require or as opportunities arise. Our unaffiliated franchisee expects to continue opening international franchise locations in Mexico.
Information Technology/Data Analytics
We are committed to having information systems that enable us to obtain, analyze and act upon information on a timely basis and to maintain effective financial and operational controls. We periodically test new technologies and platforms to support and enhance our processes across all areas of our business. We use a proprietary customer database, together with data analytics, to customize our communications and make targeted offers to customers in an effort to increase traffic in-store and online and to increase conversion.
Digital Commerce
Each of our brands has a digital flagship: www.chicos.com, www.whbm.com and www.soma.com, which provide customers the ability to browse and order merchandise, locate our stores and engage with content to enhance the shopping experience. We also offer www.chicosofftherack.com, our e-commerce site that gives customers 24/7 access to the same exclusive styles available at our Chico's Outlet locations. 
Our websites are designed to complement the in-store experience and play a vital role in both our omnichannel strategy and the customer experience. Some products are available exclusively online including extended sizes, additional style and color choices, premier partner brands and clearance items. Online merchandise is also available for order through our call center, through clienteling applications in our stores and through third parties, such as Amazon and Borderfree. We also utilize 
5

ecommerce solutions, such as ShopRunner, and are exploring new digital opportunities to expand our customer base and drive sales. 
We remain focused on our omnichannel approach by ongoing enhancements to all brand websites through new features, functionality, search engine optimization and content designed to improve and evolve the customer's experience. 
Marketing and Advertising 
Our brands use industry-leading transactional data to develop targeted and effective marketing strategies. In order to optimize our marketing efforts and to attract new customers, we continue to shift our advertising from traditional media, instead placing more emphasis on digital media. We also use predictive modeling and advanced segmentation methodologies to drive customer retention and reactivation. 
We use the following marketing and media-mix programs to engage current customers and attract prospective customers:

• | Loyalty and rewards programs;


• | Direct marketing: catalogs, postcards, email and calling campaigns;


• | Digital marketing: mobile paid search, product listing ads, display banner advertising and remarketing, affiliate programs;


• | Social marketing: organic and paid efforts across social platforms;


• | National and local print and broadcast advertising;


• | Editorial content;


• | Public relations; and


• | Charitable giving and outreach programs.

In 2019, our marketing efforts will focus on retaining existing and attracting new customers to our iconic brands' differentiated positioning by leveraging retail science and introducing alternative sales channels.
Product Sourcing
Our product sourcing activities are performed by a centralized shared service team that is focused on maintaining our quality standards and identifying cost-effective opportunities to improve production speed and flexibility. In fiscal 2018, China sources accounted for approximately 48% of our merchandise cost. We take ownership of merchandise either in the foreign country, at a designated point of entry into the United States, or at our DC, depending on the specific terms of sale. 
The majority of our merchandise is purchased through key suppliers with whom we have established strategic collaborations; these key suppliers represented 64% of our purchases in fiscal 2018 with our largest supplier accounting for 23% of the total. Currently, we believe our product sourcing is appropriately distributed among suppliers and across countries of manufacture taking into consideration product quality execution, flexibility and speed at an acceptable cost and level of risk.
Merchandise Distribution
The distribution function for all brands is handled from our DC in Winder, Georgia. New merchandise is generally received daily at the DC. Imported merchandise is shipped from the country-of-export either by sea, air, truck or rail, as circumstances require. Domestic merchandise is primarily shipped by truck or rail. Upon arrival at our DC, merchandise is sorted and packaged for shipment to individual stores or is held for future store replenishment or direct shipment to customers. Merchandise is generally pre-ticketed with price and related informational tags at the point of manufacture. 
Our DC has been granted Foreign Trade Zone status from both the U.S. Department of Commerce and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. This status facilitates international expansion and allows us to move certain merchandise into the DC without paying U.S. Customs duty until the merchandise is subsequently shipped to domestic stores or online customers.

Competition
The women’s retail apparel and intimate apparel business is highly competitive and includes local, national and international department stores, specialty stores, boutique stores, catalog companies and online retailers. We believe that our distinctively designed merchandise offerings and emphasis on customer service distinguish us from our competitors.

The number of part-time employees fluctuates during peak selling periods. As of the above date, approximately 90% of our employees worked in our boutique and outlet stores. We have no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees, have never experienced any material labor disruption and are unaware of any efforts or plans to organize our employees.
