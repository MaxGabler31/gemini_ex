Our Translation Platform and Translation Services 
 
We are developing our Translation Platform (the ‘Platform’) for regular users and/or small business for an annual license fee and/or a percentage of profits. Our Platform is going to be a cloud-based marketplace that can be accessed by a web browser on any kind of device that allows end-users to socially connect with translators that offer appropriate services in order to discuss suitable conditions of cooperation. The Platform is planned to be customized and diversified to support virtually any existing language combination. This will hugely depend on the popularity of our platform among freelance translators and users that are planned to be main customers. 
 
Our Platform engagement agreements are for a minimum term of one (1) month. Upon the expiration of this period, a user will be offered to renew his or her subscription. Our fee structure includes a combination of

periodical fees and/or a minimum of 20% of the net profits that are generated from monthly subscriptions services, E-Commerce fees and online advertising sales from the platform users.
 We, as the service provider, may terminate an engagement agreement at any time for failure of the use to pay the subscription fee. Additionally, either we as the provider, or the user, may terminate the engagement agreement for the other party’s material breach of the agreement that is incurable or uncured by the breaching party for 30 days after being service with a notice of breach of the agreement or upon mutual agreement to terminate the agreement. Upon termination of the agreement all services, rights, and authorization granted to the user will be immediately terminated and all amounts payable are immediately due and payable.
 
We are developing our Platform specifically for translation industry that we believe will have a passionate consumer base, that communicate in non-public channels, and their commerce or private activity is highly based on referral and “copy-cat” consumption. As an example, we may enter into an agreement with real estate industry and niche sports verticals like hunting and fishing. In case we decide to use machine learning (A.I.) for our Platform, it will interpolate the user behavior data through their online social activity to better connect the right people and businesses together, at the right time when online in our social network. Contrary to other social networks and E-Commerce systems like Facebook and Amazon where everyone is grouped together and forced to listen to the white noise, our Platform is planned to increase online user connectivity and stronger relationships between businesses, individual entrepreneurs, freelancers, and their customers. 
 
The Company’s management considers it best for the Platform to be accessed by subculture industries in over 120 countries and to be translated in multiple languages. We want our language translation files for the Platform to include 80% or more of the following languages: English, German, Hungarian, Portuguese, Turkish, Polish, Russian, Swedish, Slovenian, French, Dutch, Portuguese, Czech, Persian, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Romanian, Spanish, Italian and Japanese. We also plan to attract freelance translators who would be able to work with any pair of the mentioned languages. The foregoing will position international use of our Platform immediately following our future launch through individual agreements. 
 
Competition

We face competition in the social networking sector. Moving forward with development of our Platform, we plan to compete on a larger scale with Facebook, LinkedIn, eBay, and other social networks and E-Commerce sites for users’ engagement, all of which have substantially more financial resources, and a significantly larger user-base than we do. 
Competitive Advantages

Our competitive advantage is that we are solely dedicated to translation industry that business and consumer users that do not feel comfortable sharing content and information on other social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, as it may either jeopardize their personal and professional reputations or be completely lost in the white-noise of billions of other posts. 
 
Additionally, we are planning to develop specialized features for this translation industry that will incorporate E-Commerce directly into a user’s social networking account. This integration of E-Commerce directly into social networking is expected to set our Platform apart from our current competitors. 
 
Competitive Disadvantages

Our competitive disadvantages are that we do not have the operational and financial resources that our competitors have, which results in our having fewer resources to market our online Translation Platform, advertise our digital services, acquire new users on our Platform, and sell our advertising and digital services to business customers, as compared to our competitors.
