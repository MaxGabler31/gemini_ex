 Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage genetic medicines company dedicated to transforming the lives of patients suffering from rare genetic diseases with significant unmet medical needs by addressing the underlying cause of the disease. Our proprietary platform is designed to utilize our human hematopoietic stem cell derived adeno-associated virus vectors, or AAVHSCs, to precisely and efficiently deliver single administration genetic medicines in vivo through our gene therapy, our nuclease-free gene editing modality, or our gene therapy to express antibodies platform, or GTx-mAb. Our clinical programs include: HMI-102, an investigational gene therapy candidate in clinical development for the treatment of adult patients with phenylketonuria, or PKU; HMI-103, an investigational gene editing candidate in clinical development for the treatment of patients with PKU; and HMI-203, an investigational gene therapy candidate in clinical development for the treatment of patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II), or Hunter syndrome. Additionally, we are developing a gene therapy candidate, HMI-104, from our GTx-mAb platform for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH, and we are conducting research in other diseases including metachromatic leukodystrophy, or MLD. Our diverse set of AAVHSCs allows us to precisely target, via a single injection, a wide range of disease-relevant tissues, including the liver, central nervous system, or CNS, peripheral nervous system, or PNS, bone marrow, cardiac and skeletal muscle and the eye. Our genetic medicines platform is designed to provide us the flexibility to choose the method we believe is best suited for each disease we pursue, based on factors such as the targeted disease biology, the biodistribution of our AAVHSCs to key tissues and the rate of cell division the disease-relevant tissues exhibit. Our product-development strategy is to continue to develop in parallel gene therapy and gene editing, while initially leveraging the experience from our gene therapy product candidates to further advance our gene editing. We believe our technology platform will allow us to provide transformative cures using either modality.
 The unique properties of our proprietary family of 15 AAVHSCs enable us to focus on a method of gene editing called gene integration, through the replacement of an entire diseased gene in the genome with a whole functional copy by harnessing the naturally occurring deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, repair process of homologous recombination, or HR. We believe our HR-driven gene editing approach will allow us to efficiently perform gene editing at therapeutic levels without unwanted on- and off-target modifications to the genome, and to directly measure and confirm those modifications in an unbiased manner to ensure only the intended changes are made. By utilizing the body’s natural mechanism of correcting gene defects, we also avoid the need for exogenous nucleases, or bacteria-derived enzymes used in other gene editing approaches to cut DNA, which are known to significantly increase the risk of unwanted modifications.
 Clinical-Stage Product Candidates
 HMI-102: Investigational Gene Therapy for the Treatment of Adult Patients with PKU
 We are currently in Phase 2 of the pheNIX clinical trial with our first and lead product candidate, HMI-102, a gene therapy in development for the treatment of adults with PKU. We have received Fast Track Designation for HMI-102 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the prevention or treatment of neurocognitive defects due to phenylalanine hydroxylase, or PAH, deficiency through normalization of circulating Phe levels.
 In November 2020, we reported positive safety and efficacy clinical data from the dose-escalation phase of the trial. As of the data cutoff date of October 19, 2020, six patients in the dose-escalation phase of the trial had received HMI-102 across three dose cohorts (low-dose Cohort 1, n=2; mid-dose Cohort 2, n=2; high-dose Cohort 3, n=2). The results showed that HMI-102 was generally well-tolerated, and resulted in marked reductions in phenylalanine, or Phe, increases in tyrosine, or Tyr, and reductions in the Phe-to-Tyr ratio, at two doses. Phe is a registrable endpoint in PKU, and the Phe-to-Tyr ratio is a clinically relevant diagnostic measurement for PKU. Based on the safety and efficacy results observed in the dose-escalation phase, we selected and advanced two doses to the randomized, concurrently controlled, dose expansion Phase 2 portion of the pheNIX trial, which was designed to have the potential to be converted to a registrational trial.
 In October 2021, we announced that, as of September 30, 2021, both doses in the Phase 2 portion of the trial have been generally well-tolerated and have shown evidence of biological activity, including clinically meaningful reductions in Phe levels, increases in Tyr and reductions in the Phe-to-Tyr ratio. In addition, several new clinical trials sites have been recently added to the trial for a total of 15 active sites currently, with more sites expected. Despite increased interest in pheNIX, enrollment is slower than anticipated, due in part to a COVID-19 resurgence.
 On February 18, 2022, we announced our pheNIX gene therapy trial had been placed on clinical hold due to the need to modify risk-mitigation measures in the study in response to observations of elevated liver function tests, or LFTs. On March 17, 2022, we received the official clinical hold letter from the FDA requesting information on elevated LFTs observed in some

patients in the trial and modified clinical risk-mitigation measures. In patients who experienced elevated LFTs, all have resolved and no hospitalizations were required. Among the risk-mitigation methods that we intend to propose is a new, more targeted immunosuppressive regimen that is shorter in duration and includes a T-cell inhibitor used in combination with a steroid-sparing regimen that may improve patient compliance. The use of T-cell inhibitors has been shown to be effective in dampening the anticipated immune response to AAV capsids. With the additional information requested by the FDA and the planned conversion to a more targeted immunosuppressive regimen, we estimate that we will require more time to submit and receive feedback on our proposed clinical risk-mitigation strategy. As a result, we now expect to provide a program update when the path forward is established with the FDA.
 HMI-103: Gene Editing Candidate for the Treatment of Patients with PKU
 In October 2021, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1 trial with HMI-103, our lead gene editing candidate in development for the treatment of classical PKU and received Fast Track Designation for the treatment of neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric manifestations of PKU secondary to phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. The pheEDIT clinical trial is an open-label, dose escalation study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a single I.V. administration of HMI-103, and is expected to enroll up to nine patients ages 18-55 years old who have been diagnosed with classical PKU due to PAH deficiency. In addition to safety endpoints, the trial will measure serum Phe changes. The trial incorporates an immunosuppressive regimen that includes a T-cell inhibitor used in combination with a steroid-sparing regimen. We expect that the first patient in the pheEDIT clinical trial will be dosed following requisite Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Review Board approvals at the clinical sites, and completion of an 82-day screening/run-in period to account for and more closely understand day-to-day Phe fluctuations of participants. If positive safety and efficacy results are established in adults, we plan to then enroll younger patients in subsequent HMI-103 clinical trials. We expect to provide an update on the pheEDIT clinical trial at the end of 2022.
 In in vivo preclinical studies, we observed Phe reduction following a single I.V. administration of the murine surrogate of HMI-103 in the PKU disease model out to 43 weeks (end of study). In addition, using quantitative molecular methods, we have demonstrated achievement of gene integration efficiencies in a humanized murine liver model that corresponded with Phe correction in the PKU murine model.
 HMI-203: Investigational Gene Therapy for the Treatment of Adult Patients with MPS II (Hunter Syndrome)
 In October 2021, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1 trial with HMI-203, an investigational gene therapy in development for the treatment of adults with Hunter syndrome. Hunter syndrome is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the iduronate 2-sulfatase, or IDS, gene leading to absent or deficient I2S enzymatic activity, which causes toxic lysosomal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans, or GAGs. The juMPStart clinical trial is an open-label, dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a single I.V. administration of HMI-203, and is expected to enroll up to nine male patients ages 18-30 years old who have been diagnosed with Hunter syndrome and are currently receiving enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT. Qualitative data on unmet medical needs obtained from ERT-treated adult MPS II patients and/or their caregivers helped inform our trial design. Patients and caregivers reported that weekly ERT infusions, surgeries and supportive therapies inadequately address range of motion and mobility, pain, and hearing loss, that there are burdens associated with ERT and other therapies, including frequency and duration of treatment, and painful and extended recoveries, that there is a high degree of anxiety regarding prognosis, longevity, need for more invasive surgeries, and financial challenges and that the expectations for a potential one-time gene therapy include the ability to maintain their current quality of life with ERT independence. Also, key opinion leaders surveyed supported our planned design for the juMPStart clinical trial, including our plan to discontinue ERT.
 In addition to safety endpoints, the trial will measure plasma I2S activity, urinary GAG levels and other peripheral disease endpoints. We expect to provide an update on the juMPStart clinical trial at the end of 2022.
 In preclinical studies, a single I.V. administration of HMI-203 resulted in robust biodistribution and human I2S enzyme expression, leading to significant reductions in heparan sulfate GAG levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, brain, liver, heart, spleen, lung and kidney, compared with the vehicle-treated disease model. HMI-203 also led to significant reductions in skeletal deformities compared with vehicle.
 Earlier-Stage Product Candidates
 In August 2021, we named a clinical development candidate for PNH, HMI-104, from our GTx-mAb platform. This platform represents an additional way that we are leveraging our AAVHSCs in an effort to deliver one-time in vivo gene therapy to express and secrete antibodies from the liver, which we believe may allow us to target diseases with larger patient populations.


We completed Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, -enabling studies with HMI-202, an investigational gene therapy in development for the treatment of patients with MLD. We have generated preclinical data that demonstrate that a single I.V. administration of HMI-202 crossed the blood-brain and blood-nerve-barriers and led to sustained reduction of sulfatides in all brain regions of the disease model. We are applying the learnings from the IND-enabling studies to further optimize an HMI-202 vector that we believe may lead to a better therapeutic profile.
 Manufacturing
 On March 10, 2022, we closed our previously announced transaction with Oxford Biomedica plc, or Oxford, to establish Oxford Biomedica Solutions LLC, a high-performing, full-scope AAV vector manufacturing company that will offer global pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients innovative manufacturing expertise in AAV and lentiviral-based cell and gene therapies. The new company incorporates our proven 'plug and play' process development and manufacturing platform, as well as our experienced team and high-quality GMP vector production capabilities that we built and have been operating since 2019. Under the terms of the agreement, we contributed our manufacturing team of 125 experts, our manufacturing facility and equipment, manufacturing-related intellectual property and know-how and certain other assets. Oxford paid us a $130.0 million upfront payment and invested $50.0 million to fund the new company in exchange for an 80-percent ownership stake, while we own 20 percent of the new company. Our agreement with Oxford establishes us as a preferred client of the new manufacturing company with the goal of reducing our costs while maintaining process development and manufacturing capabilities and dedicated manufacturing capacity to support our product candidates, while jointly continuing to advance innovations in AAV manufacturing. See “Manufacturing—Oxford Biomedica Solutions Transaction” below and Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our agreement with Oxford.
Management Team and Cash Raised
 Our management team has a successful track record of discovering, developing and commercializing therapeutics with a particular focus on rare diseases. We have a robust intellectual property portfolio with issued composition of matter patents in the United States for our family of 15 AAVHSCs and we believe the breadth and depth of our intellectual property is a strategic asset that has the potential to provide us with a significant competitive advantage. We continue to build on our intellectual property estate through our ongoing product and platform-development efforts.
 Since our inception in 2015, we have raised approximately $721 million in aggregate net proceeds through our initial public offering, or IPO, in April 2018, follow-on public offerings of common stock in April 2019 and April 2021, proceeds from the sale of common stock under an “at-the-market” sales agreement, equity investments, preferred stock financings and our newly announced agreement with Oxford. Included in our net proceeds is a $130.0 million up-front cash payment from our agreement with Oxford, $50.0 million from Novartis Institutes of BioMedical Research, Inc., comprised of an up-front payment of $35.0 million and a $15.0 million equity investment, and a $60.0 million equity investment from Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, through a private placement transaction. We will require additional capital in order to advance our product candidates through clinical development and commercialization. We believe our compelling preclinical data, positive clinical data with HMI-102, scientific expertise, product-development strategy and robust intellectual property position us as a leader in the development of genetic medicines.
 Our Opportunity in Genetic Medicines
We are currently focused on monogenic diseases where the genetic abnormality is known to occur in a single gene. The majority of monogenic diseases harbor thousands of individual mutations within the diseased gene, each resulting in a loss of function. Adding a functional gene to the cell where there is a missing or mutated gene, replacing an entire diseased gene with a whole functional gene, or expressing an antibody to address the underlying genetic disease mechanism, are the optimal therapeutic approaches for addressing these monogenic disorders. This can be accomplished either through a method of gene therapy called gene transfer in slowly or non-dividing cells, or through a method of gene editing called gene integration in rapidly dividing cells.
The current focus of most nuclease-based gene editing companies is gene knockout, or knocking out a diseased gene to prevent the expression of an undesired protein. Since gene knockout does not result in a fully-corrected gene, this method can only potentially address the minority of monogenic diseases where a diseased protein requires knock-down or inactivation. Our HR-driven gene editing approach aims to achieve functional gene integration into the patient’s genome and potentially address the majority of monogenic diseases by replacing an entire diseased gene with a whole functional gene. Our gene therapy approach, on the other hand, seeks to introduce a functional copy of a defective gene into a patient’s own cells, but not incorporate such copy into the patient’s genome. This method results in the expression of the therapeutic protein of interest without changing the genome.
DNA Repair Pathways
Human cells harbor two primary independent pathways to maintain the integrity of DNA: homologous recombination, or HR, and non-homologous end joining, or NHEJ, which are described below:
•HR is a process in which cells repair DNA through highly precise incorporation of correct DNA sequences that are homologous, or matching, to the site of damage. HR has evolved to repair DNA with high fidelity and avoids the introduction of unwanted mutations at the site of correction. In the late 1990s, researchers discovered that certain AAV vectors delivered long single strands of homologous DNA to specific regions in the genome and induced the HR pathway, but their low efficiency of approximately 1% limited their use as a viable option for in vivo therapeutics.
 •NHEJ is a less selective, error-prone process that rapidly joins the ends of broken DNA resulting in a high frequency of insertions or deletions at the break site. The discovery of nuclease-based gene editing technologies provided researchers with novel tools to specifically introduce DNA breaks into the genome. Despite high potential for error, the majority of nuclease-based gene editing approaches primarily utilize the NHEJ pathway. 
 We believe the major limitation of nuclease-based gene editing is the preferential utilization of the error-prone NHEJ pathway instead of the HR pathway. Because of this preference, the greatest utility of nuclease-based gene editing technologies may lie in their ability to knockout genes rather than replace an entire diseased gene in the genome with a whole functional copy. Furthermore, the use of nuclease-based gene editing technologies for insertion of a corrective sequence carries the risk of unwanted mutations from NHEJ including insertions and deletions or opposite orientation insertion of the template DNA, and also requires the separate delivery of both the nuclease and the DNA template to the same location at the same time.
We believe the unique characteristics of our genetic medicines platform will allow us to focus on the HR pathway, enabling precise nuclease-free gene integration with improved efficiency and a broader set of disease targets.
Our Approach
Our product-development strategy is to continue to develop in parallel both gene therapy and gene editing modalities, and to choose the method we believe is best suited for each disease we pursue, based on such factors as the targeted disease biology, the biodistribution of our AAVHSCs to key tissues, and the rate of cell division the tissues exhibit, all while initially leveraging the experience from our gene therapy modality to further advance our gene editing modality. Refer to Figure 1 below for a graphical depiction of our platform.
Figure 1. Our Genetic Medicines Platform.
Our novel AAVHSCs are packaged with either a gene therapy or a gene editing construct. Our gene therapy construct includes a functional copy of the gene and a promoter sequence that is designed to enable the gene to be turned on in the cell and ultimately transcribed to express the therapeutic protein of interest without integrating into the genome. Our gene editing construct includes lengthy guide sequences, or homology arms, which are designed to enable the specific alignment to the desired genomic location and then, through the natural process of HR, enable correction of the diseased gene in the genome by replacement with a whole functional copy. While others are working on identifying and testing ways to mitigate the inherent risk in working with nucleases for gene editing, our approach avoids the use of nucleases entirely. By targeting the HR pathway, our proprietary AAVHSCs mitigate the risks of nuclease-based technologies and have the potential to overcome other AAV vector limitations by combining the precision and high fidelity of HR with highly efficient in vivo gene integration, which we believe is capable of providing potential cures for a wide range of rare genetic diseases. Refer to Figure 2 below for a graphical depiction of how our AAVHSCs are designed to enable each therapeutic modality.



Figure 2. How our AAVHSCs are designed to enable each therapeutic modality.
We believe our approach has several key advantages, including:
 Our proprietary AAVHSC platform enables both gene therapy and gene editing modalities. Our platform provides us the flexibility to deliver genetic medicines through the best suited modality from either gene therapy or gene editing for each disease we pursue, based on such factors as the targeted disease biology, the biodistribution of our AAVHSCs to key tissues, and the rate of cell division the tissues exhibit. Our AAVHSCs are naturally occurring as they were originally isolated from normal human CD34 cells and have the potential to result in an improved safety profile.
  Ability to perform nuclease-free gene editing mediated by HR with high gene integration efficiency. Our family of 15 novel AAVHSCs are designed to enable us to take advantage of the precise and high-fidelity process of HR-directed gene insertion for nuclease-free gene editing while achieving gene integration efficiencies that we believe are in therapeutic ranges and significantly higher than both nuclease-based and other AAV-based approaches. While nuclease-based gene editing technologies have achieved high gene knockout efficiencies in preclinical studies, which is only potentially useful for the minority of monogenic diseases, they have shown limited published evidence of gene integration efficiencies to date.
 Ability to introduce an entire gene into the genome or the precise repair of individual mutated nucleotides in addition to gene knockout. Our HR-based gene editing approach provides the flexibility to introduce an entire copy of a functional gene into the genome also known as gene integration, in addition to repairing single mutations or knocking out entire genes, thus allowing us to potentially address the significant majority of monogenic diseases.
 High precision and lack of unwanted off-target or on-target DNA modifications. Our gene editing approach leverages HR, which makes DNA repairs with high fidelity, and enables us to precisely perform gene integration without unwanted off- and on-target modifications. Furthermore, we are able to directly measure and confirm those modifications throughout the entire genome to ensure only the intended changes are made.
 Ability to target multiple tissues. In preclinical studies, intravenous administration of our family of AAVHSCs has demonstrated unique biodistribution properties across the serotypes and the ability to target a wide variety of tissues including the liver, CNS, PNS, muscle, bone marrow, eye and heart, enabling us to potentially address a broad range of monogenic diseases. The diversity of our AAVHSC library of capsids can also be expanded through targeted shuffling of the capsid sequences.
 In vivo administration with a single component delivery system. Our platform is designed to perform gene editing at high efficiency without the use of a nuclease, enabling us to deliver genetic medicines in vivo using a single vector system that contains everything required to edit DNA. These characteristics simplify the manufacturing and delivery of our therapeutic candidates relative to existing nuclease-based gene editing approaches.

 Ability to target a broad range of patients given low frequency of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies. We believe our AAVHSCs can target a broad range of patient populations given the low prevalence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies relative to other AAV vectors.
Our Pipeline Strategy
We believe our genetic medicines platform can be applied broadly to treat and potentially cure a wide range of genetic diseases, and we have carefully designed and prioritized our pipeline strategy to maximize this opportunity. We are initially pursuing monogenic diseases where we know exactly what we are seeking to correct and exactly which gene to insert into patients’ cells, including delivery via our GTx-mAb platform to express and secrete antibodies from the liver. We are prioritizing monogenic diseases with significant unmet medical needs, validated regulatory pathways, well-accepted biomarkers and significant commercial opportunities. We are currently focused on developing product candidates to treat monogenic diseases in the liver, CNS and peripheral tissues, bone marrow, and the eye, given that our AAVHSCs naturally show a high degree of tropism or ability to enter cells in these organs and organ systems. These tissues are affected in many rare genetic diseases.
 Our initial focus areas include developing product candidates for intracellular, inborn errors of metabolism and other genetic conditions that are especially well-suited to correction by our gene editing or gene therapy methods. In slow- or non-dividing cells (e.g., CNS and adult liver cells), gene therapy can potentially be curative, while rapidly dividing cells (e.g., hematopoietic CD34+ cells and pediatric liver cells) require a gene editing approach to provide a permanent correction in the genome that can be replicated with each cell division. We are purposefully deploying our proprietary AAVHSCs in certain indications first with a gene therapy approach followed by a gene editing approach, in order to maximize the likelihood of translating our platform into widespread clinical and commercial success.
 We are building a deep pipeline across a wide range of diseases and tissue types to leverage the broad potential of our platform. We believe we have validated our AAVHSC platform in the liver based on the results observed in the dose-escalation portion of our Phase 1/2 trial with HMI-102, and we have also initiated a Phase 1 trial with HMI-103, a gene editing development candidate for pediatric PKU. We have completed a comprehensive in vivo biodistribution study in NHPs in which all 11 of the AAVHSCs tested crossed the blood-brain-barrier and the blood-nerve-barrier, we have initiated a Phase 1 trial with HMI-203, a gene therapy development candidate for MPS II, or Hunter syndrome, are advancing a development candidate for PNH, HMI-104, from our GTx-mAb platform through IND-enabling studies and we are further optimizing our HMI-202 vector that we believe may lead to a better therapeutic profile for the potential treatment of MLD. We continue our discovery efforts across multiple targets, including the liver, CNS, human stem cells and ophthalmology. We also may selectively enter into strategic alliances with pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical companies to expand indications and accelerate development of programs where collaborators can contribute further disease-specific expertise to our platform.


Our Product Pipeline
The current status of our programs is summarized in the table below:

Our Strategy
Our goal is to transform the lives of patients suffering from severe genetic diseases by using gene therapy and gene editing to cure the underlying cause of the disease. The critical components of our strategy to achieve this goal include:
 Transform the treatment paradigm for rare genetic diseases with the delivery of single-administration curative therapies. Utilizing our proprietary AAVHSCs, we intend to deliver genetic medicines in vivo via a single administration to address the underlying genetic problem in a given disease. For each of the programs in our pipeline, we have identified the mutations of a specific gene that we believe can potentially be addressed by introducing a functional copy of a defective gene via gene therapy, or by replacing an aberrant gene with a healthy one via HR-driven gene integration, resulting in specific integration into the patient’s genome. Our genetic medicines platform allows us to choose the best suited modality for each disease we pursue, and we believe our nucleaise-free editing approach will provide life-long clinical benefits for patients.
 Advance our pipeline programs through clinical proof-of-concept and commercialization. We are continuing to advance the pheNIX clinical trial with investigational HMI-102 gene therapy for adults with PKU at multiple sites in the U.S. In October 2021, we announced that both doses from the dose expansion Phase 2 portion of the pheNIX trial have been generally well-tolerated and have shown evidence of biological activity, including clinically meaningful reductions in Phe levels, increases in Tyr and reductions in the Phe-to-Tyr ratio. On February 18, 2022, we announced our pheNIX gene therapy trial had been placed on clinical hold due to the need to modify risk-mitigation measures in the study in response to observations of elevated LFTs. On March 17, 2022, we received the official clinical hold letter from the FDA requesting information on elevated LFTs observed in some patients in the trial and modified clinical risk-mitigation measures. In patients who experienced elevated LFTs, all have resolved and no hospitalizations were required. Among the risk-mitigation methods that we intend to propose is a new, more targeted immunosuppressive regimen that is shorter in duration and includes a T-cell inhibitor used in combination with a steroid-sparing regimen that may improve patient compliance. The use of T-cell inhibitors has been shown to be effective in dampening the anticipated immune response to AAV capsids. With the additional information requested by the FDA and the planned conversion to a more targeted immunosuppressive regimen, we estimate that we will require more time to submit and receive feedback on our proposed clinical risk-mitigation strategy. Also in October 2021, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1 trial with HMI-103, our lead gene editing candidate in development for the treatment of classical PKU. We believe our approach of initially utilizing one of our AAVHSCs for gene therapy in adult PKU patients while, in parallel, advancing gene editing for pediatric PKU patients will maximize the efficiency of our pipeline development while providing potential solutions for the unique needs of each particular PKU patient population. Given the

well-defined nature of PKU and the concentration of treatment centers, we intend to bring HMI-102, if approved, to patients through a small, targeted internal commercial organization. Finally, in October 2021, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1 trial with HMI-203, an in vivo investigational gene therapy in development for the treatment of adults with Hunter syndrome, a lysosomal storage disorder.
  Continue to expand our pipeline within existing therapeutic areas and expand into new therapeutic areas. We are focused on applying the transformative potential of our genetic medicines platform to develop treatments for patients with monogenic diseases. Initially, we are targeting diseases occurring in the liver, the CNS and PNS, the eye and the hematopoietic system as well as targeting the liver for the expression of therapeutic antibodies. Given the ability of our AAVHSCs to deliver to a wide range of disease-relevant tissues, we believe there are many additional indications for which our technology may be applicable, including other inborn errors of metabolism, lysosomal storage diseases, hematological diseases, and ophthalmic diseases, as well as for in vivo cell therapy. We may also choose to selectively collaborate to expand the indications we can pursue and accelerate development of programs where collaborators can contribute further disease-specific expertise to our platform.
 Strengthen our platform by leveraging our discovery and development capabilities and selectively collaborating. We are committed to investing in our research and development activities to expand the capabilities of our platform, specifically our AAVHSCs as well as HR gene editing technology. We are optimizing our AAVHSC genetic medicines platform with focused efforts on AAVHSC characterization, gene therapy and editing construct design and screening, and genomic assays to characterize and quantify our editing technology. To augment our own efforts, we intend to continue to collaborate with academic institutions to pursue new scientific and therapeutic insights and strengthen our position as a leader in gene integration.
 Continue to leverage our manufacturing capabilities. We have fully integrated process development and GMP manufacturing capabilities that support the full breadth and flexibility of our AAVHSC capsid library. We have developed a process development platform that accommodates both gene therapy and gene editing technologies. We have executed our manufacturing platform with multiple product candidates at the 2,000-liter bioreactor scale. In January 2022, we announced an agreement with Oxford to establish a new AAV vector manufacturing company that incorporates our proven 'plug and play' process development and manufacturing platform, as well as our experienced team and high-quality GMP vector production capabilities that we built and have been operating since 2019. The related transactions closed on March 10, 2022. We will continue to leverage these process development and manufacturing capabilities while reducing our costs and maintaining dedicated manufacturing capacity to support our product candidates. We believe the quality, reliability and scalability of our gene therapy and gene editing manufacturing approach is a core competitive advantage crucial to our long-term success.
 Continue to strengthen and expand our intellectual property portfolio. We have exclusive worldwide rights to our technologies including issued composition of matter patents in the United States for 15 of our novel AAVHSCs for both gene therapy and gene editing. We exclusively acquired rights to this foundational intellectual property for the AAVHSCs from City of Hope, or COH, for developing and commercializing therapeutics based on these vectors. We continue to focus on strengthening our intellectual property estate through the discovery of new AAVHSCs, further characterization around our existing AAVHSCs as well as the core technology involved in delivering our product candidates to patients. To further advance our leadership in gene therapy and nuclease-free gene editing, we actively explore opportunities to collaborate with other leading scientific institutions in the field.
Our Genetic Medicines Platform
Our proprietary genetic medicines platform is built on our novel AAVHSCs, which allow us to choose the best suited modality from either gene integration or gene therapy for each disease we pursue, based on such factors as the targeted disease biology, the biodistribution of our AAVHSCs to key tissues, and the rate of cell division the target tissues exhibit. The unique characteristics of our platform enable nuclease-free gene editing, specifically gene integration, and broad, systemic tissue distribution. Our AAVHSCs are designed to directly integrate corrective DNA through HR with therapeutically relevant efficiencies. Our HR-based gene editing approach utilizes a single component AAV system that contains everything required to selectively edit DNA with no need for exogenous nucleases or editing machinery. This single-component system simplifies the manufacturing and delivery of our therapeutics. We believe our gene editing approach has the potential to be curative as it provides a permanent correction in the genome that is then replicated with each cell division so that new generations of cells will carry the corrected gene. Our AAVHSCs are naturally occurring and have been modified to be non-replicating to minimize

potential safety issues. We believe our platform’s combined attributes will allow us to develop more efficient and safer therapeutics for a wide range of genetic diseases.
Homologous Recombination—A Powerful Basis for Gene Editing
Unlike other gene editing approaches, our technology is based on the natural DNA repair process of HR and is designed to enable precise and efficient gene integration without an exogenous nuclease.
Our genetic medicines platform induces the endogenous HR cellular process using our AAVHSCs to insert replacement or corrective genes into cells that contain mutated or deleterious genes (refer to Figure 3 below). We engineer our AAVHSCs to contain long, single-stranded DNA corrective sequences highly specific to the target region in the genome. These single-stranded DNA molecules are then delivered to cells in our AAVHSC vectors, which we believe results in precise and efficient gene integration via the HR pathway. The design of our long and specific sequences, up to the 4.7 kilobase packaging limit of our AAVHSCs, is intended to significantly reduce the risk of off-target integration. Based on the packaging size of our AAVHSCs, we believe our capsids are capable of accommodating and delivering up to approximately 85% of the genes in the human genome and thus have the ability to address a significant majority of genetic disorders. We typically use homology arms as long as 1,600 base pairs of DNA to target corrective gene sequences into precise regions of the genome, in contrast to the guide sequences used in CRISPR/Cas 9-based gene editing, which are typically less than 30 base pairs in length. We also benefit from the ability of our platform to utilize HR to precisely insert gene sequences into the DNA of cells, similar to how mammalian cells repair their own DNA. In order to bring about the excision and subsequent replacement that some forms of gene editing require, those other approaches must combine multiple additional techniques and deliver into the cell the requisite cellular machinery at the right place at the same time, increasing the complexity of the task, introducing the possibility of integrating the wrong DNA due to non-HR-based repair mechanisms, and reducing the likelihood of success.

Our Proprietary AAVHSCs
Our genetic medicines platform is based on a family of 15 proprietary AAVHSCs which we can deploy with either gene therapy or gene editing constructs. We have the opportunity to expand on this family through capsid shuffling. Both applications rely on the unique ability of our AAVHSCs to efficiently target multiple tissues in the body. Our AAVHSCs were isolated from human stem cells, and we believe they can direct nuclease-free gene integration with higher efficiency relative to that indicated in published data for other AAV-based gene editing approaches. Our AAVHSCs display the following advantages:
Single AAVHSC Platform for Both Gene Therapy and Gene Editing Modalities
Our platform provides us the flexibility to deliver genetic medicines through the best suited modality from either gene therapy or gene editing for each disease we pursue, based on factors such as the targeted disease biology, the biodistribution of our AAVHSCs to key tissues, and the rate of cell division the tissues exhibit.
Ability to Perform In Vivo Nuclease-free Gene Editing Mediated by HR
To demonstrate the utility of AAVHSC-mediated gene editing in vivo, we conducted a series of experiments at our headquarters. We obtained preclinical proof-of-concept for in vivo editing efficiency and tissue-specific expression through the design of a promoter-less luciferase construct targeting the murine Factor 8, or F8, locus using AAVHSC15. F8 is a locus in the murine genome that is known to have a strong promoter but is expressed only in the liver. The editing cassette was flanked by 800bp homology arms with sequences homologous to an insertion site within intron 6 of the murine F8 gene. The expression cassette (hereafter mF8-Luc) also included a canonical splice acceptor sequence for splicing into the endogenous F8 transcript and a ribosomal skipping 2A element for independent translation of the F8 and luciferase proteins. The luciferase transcript was terminated by an SV40pA element.
 AAVHSC15 packaging the promoter-less F8 targeting cassette (AAVHSC15-mF8-Luc) was administered by a single intravenous injection to albino-B6 mice to evaluate the level of targeted integration and expression from the murine F8 locus. Six- to seven-week-old albino-B6 mice were dosed with AAVHSC15-mF8-Luc and reporter expression was followed over time. High levels of lumanciferase expression in livers of mice transduced under these conditions were observed. Bioluminescence increased within a week post-dosing, reached a maximum within 1-2 months and remained significantly above that observed in vehicle-treated mice until the end of the study at 470 days post-dosing (*= P<0.0001 vs vehicle). Ex vivo imaging of tissues harvested on Day 470 showed highest luciferase expression within liver (*=p<0.008 vs vehicle), greater than 100-fold higher than other tissues assessed (**=P<0.0001 vs other tissues), which demonstrated specificity of tissue targeting by AAVHSC15-mF8-Luc (refer to Figure 4 below). At 470 days post-dosing, vector genome levels within livers of treated mice were on average 4.7 ± 2.7 vector genomes/allele.
   Figure 4. In vivo gene editing proof-of-concept at the murine F8 locus.
To molecularly characterize AAVHSC15-mF8-Luc-mediated genome editing, a ddPCR-based quantitative F8 editing assay was established. A combination of an F8 locus specific primer and probe and editing vector specific primer and probe in the FAM and HEX channel, respectively, were used to calculate the fraction of F8 loci that have an inserted luciferase transgene. Editing signal in this assay showed linear detection between 0 and 30% allele frequencies based on a standard curve of known molar ratios of edited/unedited alleles. Assay signal was specific as digestion of input DNA with HindIII prior to the ddPCR assay separated the payload from the genomic reference, causing each target to segregate independently within each droplet eliminating the editing signal.
Genomic DNA was isolated from livers of treated mice at termination of the study at 470 days post-dosing and editing of the murine F8 locus was assessed by the ddPCR editing assay. Mice treated with AAVHSC15-mF8-Luc at this initial low dose of 5e12 vg/kg showed a statistically significant increase in genome editing efficiencies with up to 2.8% of alleles edited (mean 0.8% of alleles edited with a range of editing efficiencies 0.2-2.8%; p<0.03 vs. vehicle). These data demonstrate that AAVHSC15 mediated long-term in vivo editing of the targeted locus within the liver of mice at this dose.


To assess whether expression from AAVHSC15-mF8-Luc was episomal, an AAVHSC15-Luc editing vector was prepared with the splice acceptor sequences removed (designated AAVHSC15-∆2AmF8-Luc) but maintained an intact Met initiator codon. Relative to an IV injection of vehicle alone, injection of AAVHSC15-mF8-Luc increased luciferase expression at Days 3, 7, and 14 post-dosing, similar to the results described above. By contrast, luciferase expression was reduced >95% for mice that received an identical dose of AAVHSC15-∆2AmF8-Luc (refer to Figure 5 below).

 Ability to Introduce Entire Gene into the Genome Mediated via HR
Initial data supporting the targeted integration of entire genes using AAVHSCs into the genome have been previously published. We have expanded on those initial studies by demonstrating the targeted integration of a full-length luciferase gene into the murine F8 locus, as described above and illustrated in Figures 4 and 5. This preliminary proof of principle led to the discovery and development of a therapeutic program for pediatric PKU focused on the targeted integration of a full-length PAH cDNA into the human PAH locus. We have successfully inserted full-length cDNA encoding luciferase and PAH into two separate genomic regions in vivo reaching levels of efficiency required for therapeutic efficacy. HMI-103, the development candidate for pediatric PKU, is described in detail below.
 The ability to introduce entire genes specifically into the genome at these efficiencies provides an opportunity to target multiple monogenic diseases where the correction of a defective gene would result in therapeutic benefit. Given that a majority of monogenic diseases harbor mutations that render the gene inactive, we believe our gene integration modality can be expanded well beyond our initial focus on liver-based inborn errors of metabolism.
 High Precision and Lack of Unwanted Off-target or On-target DNA Modifications
Using next-generation sequencing technologies, we have developed methodologies to test for on-target mutations at the site of integration. Using these methods, we observed that HR using our AAVHSCs is very precise at the site of correction. We did not detect any co-incident random mutations at or above our lower limit of detection (0.5%) or inverted terminal repeat, or ITR, sequences at the site of integration.
We developed a method to enable whole genome unbiased next-generation sequencing for the detection and mapping of off-target integration sites. By leveraging the potential ability of our AAVHSCs to drive HR-based targeted integration, we can utilize next-generation sequencing technologies to identify and quantify where the inserted sequence maps. Using this method, and testing integration into the human AAVS1 locus, we estimate that 99.967% of insertions (>2.2 million reads) are at the targeted site and that the balance is within expected background of the assay. We have expanded on this assay to characterize the on-target precision of integration at the PAH locus in support of HMI-103, described below.
Ability to Target Multiple Tissues
In preclinical studies, intravenous administration of our family of AAVHSCs has demonstrated the ability to target a wide variety of tissues including the liver, CNS, PNS, muscle, bone marrow, eye and heart. Specifically, we have generated evidence of our AAVHSCs’ ability to target a number of tissues including:
•neurons throughout the brain, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglion by crossing the blood-brain-barrier and the blood-nerve-barrier; 
 •retinal ganglion cells and neurons of the retinal outer nuclear layer; we have also demonstrated the ability to target retinal tissue via intravenous injection as well as multiple layers of target cells, including photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelial cells and horizontal cells, through sub-retinal injection; 
 •skeletal muscle myocytes in all skeletal muscle tissues examined, including gastrocnemius, soleus, diaphragm, esophagus, and biceps; 
 •cardiomyocytes throughout the heart; and 
 •extensive liver tropism. 
 

Figure 6. Our family of AAVHSCs has demonstrated the ability to target a wide variety of tissues.
 In Vivo Administration with a Single Component Delivery System
Our platform is designed to perform gene integration at higher efficiency without the use of a nuclease, enabling us to deliver genetic medicines in vivo using a single vector system (refer to Figure 7 below). Existing nuclease-based gene editing technologies, when replacing a defective gene with a functional gene through gene editing, require the use of two or more different vector constructs in combination to perform their gene editing functions. One or more vector constructs house the nuclease, and the other vector construct houses the DNA template, and all vectors must reach and penetrate the specific target cell at the same time to edit the DNA. In contrast to these nuclease-based gene editing technologies, our AAVHSC technology is a single component system that contains everything required to selectively integrate DNA with no need for additional exogenous nucleases, template DNA or editing machinery.

We believe our ability to perform gene integration at efficiencies that are greater than both nuclease-based and other AAV-based approaches, coupled with our single component delivery system, enable us to administer genetic medicines in vivo. We believe the advantages of in vivo administration of therapeutics via a single component delivery system include the following:
•simpler and faster manufacturing relative to ex vivo resulting in reduced manufacturing costs; 
 •improved delivery of therapeutic as only a single vector is required to reach a cell instead of multiple vectors; 
 •ease of use for the patient, eliminating the need for mobilization and myeloablation, a common requirement for many ex vivo gene editing therapies; and 
 •improved safety profile, as compared to an ex vivo therapy.

Ability to Target a Broad Range of Patients Given Low Frequency of Pre-Existing Neutralizing Antibodies
A potential concern for all AAV vectors is the presence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies that have the potential to reduce their effectiveness. We conducted a study across 100 human serum donors representing different ethnic segments of the U.S. population. Based on the initial results, we believe the findings suggest that approximately 80% of individuals lack antibodies that recognize AAVHSCs, which is comparable to AAV9, a commonly used vector for development of other gene therapies. These findings were published in Human Gene Therapy Clinical Development in March 2018.
Our Product Candidates
We believe our genetic medicines platform can be applied broadly to treat and cure a wide range of genetic diseases and have carefully designed and prioritized our pipeline strategy to maximize this opportunity. We are initially pursuing diseases where the genetic abnormality is known and is found in a single gene.
HMI-102 for Treatment of PKU in Adult Patients and HMI-103 for Treatment of PKU in Pediatric Patients
 Our lead program, HMI-102, is an AAVHSC vector gene therapy candidate designed to treat PAH deficiency, the underlying genetic cause of PKU. We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA and the European Commission for the use of AAVHSC15 expressing PAH for the treatment of PAH deficiency. In June 2019, we commenced enrollment of our Phase 1/2 pheNIX clinical trial with HMI-102 gene therapy for adults with classical PKU at multiple sites in the U.S. and reported positive clinical data in November 2020. We are currently in the dose expansion Phase 2 portion of the pheNIX trial. HMI-102 is intended to treat adult patients with deficiencies in PAH regardless of the specific underlying PAH mutation. On February 18, 2022, we announced our pheNIX gene therapy trial had been placed on clinical hold and on March 17, 2022, we received the official clinical hold letter from the FDA requesting information on elevated LFTs observed in the trial and modified clinical risk-mitigation measures.
 In October 2021, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1 trial with HMI-103, our lead gene editing candidate in development for the treatment of classical PKU, and we received Fast Track Designation for HMI-103 for the treatment of neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric manifestations of PKU secondary to PAH deficiency. HMI-103 is designed to replace the

defective PAH gene through the targeted integration of a normal copy into the PAH genomic region. We received orphan medicinal product designation and advanced therapy medicinal product classification from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for HMI-103 for PKU.
 PKU Disease Overview
PKU is an inborn error of metabolism that results from mutations in the PAH gene. PAH is an enzyme that is normally expressed in the liver and is necessary to metabolize dietary phenylalanine, or Phe, to the amino acid tyrosine, or Tyr. Tyr is a product of Phe metabolism and a precursor to neurotransmitters, and its increase indicates increased enzymatic activity. PKU results from mutations in PAH that render its enzymatic activity deficient. If it is not metabolized by PAH, Phe builds up throughout the body, including in the blood and the nervous system. Approximately 75% of all dietary Phe is typically metabolized by PAH, so the absence of PAH leads directly to the pathological excess of Phe as well as a deficiency of Tyr. Excessive blood Phe and low levels of Tyr result in intellectual disability, which is possibly caused by a variety of mechanisms including effects on neuronal development, myelination, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Blood Phe is an easily measurable and translatable biomarker. It is also a validated clinical endpoint in clinical trials for PKU, facilitating both a rapid path to the clinic and characterization of therapeutic response.
 Newborns in all 50 states are screened for PKU. It has been estimated that the incidence of PKU in the United States is one in 12,707, which translates to approximately 350 cases per year with an overall prevalence of 16,500. It has also been estimated that the prevalence of PKU in the European Union is 25,000. Worldwide, the estimated prevalence is 50,000 with 1,000 to 1,500 new cases annually.
The majority of patients are identified soon after birth and are primarily treated by dietary restriction of Phe. While Phe-restricted diets have dramatically reduced the intellectual deficiencies associated with this disease, they fail to address the cognitive and behavioral problems that continue throughout a patient’s life. Lifetime adherence to a Phe-restricted diet is challenging and blood Phe within the recommended range is not achievable for the vast majority of patients. The inability to achieve recommended levels of Phe results in neurological as well as metabolic problems. Long-term studies in adults identify neurocognitive, psychosocial, quality of life, growth, nutrition, bone pathology and maternal PKU outcomes that are suboptimal despite early and continuous treatment with diet. In a retrospective study of PKU patients peer reviewed and published in the journal of Molecular Genetics & Metabolism, young children were adherent to Phe-restricted diet, whereas most adolescents (79%) did not achieve recommended Phe levels, and 88% of adults were no longer on a Phe-restricted diet. Relaxing of dietary restrictions beyond preschool years, or failure to adhere to physician-assigned diets, which is the current guideline for most adolescents and adults, results in loss of metabolic control and wide fluctuations in Phe levels that are both directly associated with progressive neurological damage.
 We conducted a five-year retrospective chart review of PKU patients, which confirmed key elements of our proposed Phase 1/2 clinical trial design. Consistent findings from two PKU academic centers of excellence in the U.S. in 152 PKU patients showed that actively monitored patients, including those on restrictive low Phe diet, had Phe levels well-above the recommended threshold of 360 umol/L, based on current U.S. treatment guidelines, underscoring the need for treatments that restore the normal biochemical pathway (refer to Figure 8 below). Furthermore, we confirmed that Phe continues to be higher, even on standard of care, in the classical PKU population, defined as patients with Phe levels greater than 1200 umol/L (66% of

the study population) without treatment, and was significantly elevated in the adult population compared to those patients who were less than 18 years of age. These findings were published in Molecular Genetics and Metabolism in December 2019.
 

Figure 8. Retrospective five-year chart review demonstrates actively monitored adult classical PKU patients across two academic centers have Phe levels >700 umol/L.
 Current Treatments
There are currently no available treatments that address the core underlying genetic biochemical defect in PKU, the deficiency of PAH.
Saproterin dihydrochloride, or Kuvan, is an FDA-approved therapy to reduce elevations in serum Phe. Saproterin is a synthetic version of BH4, a cofactor that is required for PAH activity. Treatment with BH4 can activate residual PAH enzyme activity, improve the normal oxidative metabolism of Phe, and decrease Phe levels in some patients; however, clinical data suggests that saproterin is not fully effective in lowering high serum levels of Phe back to normal levels and must be used in conjunction with a low Phe diet. Worldwide sales of Kuvan were approximately $286 million in 2021. Generic versions of Kuvan are available in several countries around the world, including multiple generic versions in the U.S.
Pegvaliase, or Palynziq, is a pegylated plant-derived enzyme called phenylalanine ammonia lyase that was approved in the U.S. by the FDA in 2018 and in Europe by the EMA in 2019. This approach does not correct the underlying genetic disorder (PAH deficiency) and will not reconstitute the natural pathway. We believe Palynziq to have certain limitations including that it must be administered via daily injections and its label contains a black box warning that it can cause severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) that may be life-threatening and can happen at any time during treatment with Palynziq. The label states that patients must carry auto-injectable epinephrine with them at all times during Palynziq treatment. Patients in its Phase 3 trials did not meet the secondary efficacy endpoints for cognitive benefit. Worldwide sales of Palynziq were approximately $237 million in 2021.
 Our Gene Therapy and Gene Editing Approaches to PKU
We are taking two approaches towards developing a potential therapy for PKU. The first is a gene therapy in which a gene construct encoding human PAH is delivered to liver cells where it directs production of normal PAH via episomal expression driven off a liver-specific promoter. The second potential therapy involves gene integration of a normal copy of the PAH gene into the defective gene of PKU patients. We believe that the gene therapy approach offers an expedited clinical development path towards delivery of a therapeutic to adult and adolescent patients where the majority of target cells are non-dividing in the liver. We believe the gene integration approach would be more suitable in newborn and pediatric patients due to the higher rate of dividing cells as the child grows. The goal of both approaches is to enable production of functional PAH, thus restoring the normal biochemical pathway of Phe metabolism. This can reduce the abnormally high levels of Phe in the blood, while also increasing Tyr levels, the product of PAH-driven Phe metabolism. Using gene editing to correct the defective PAH gene in young patients has the potential to provide long-term benefit as the corrected gene will persist as cells replicate. Correcting the gene has the potential to normalize not only Phe levels, but also Tyr levels, the product of the Phe metabolism and a precursor to neurotransmitter synthesis. This may allow affected children to avoid many of the serious neurological consequences associated with PKU.

We believe that an effective gene therapy or gene editing treatment for PKU has the potential to eliminate the need for Phe-restricted diet and may lead to significant improvements in the morbidity and quality of life for patients. Published estimates suggest that restoration of PAH activity to 10% or more of normal levels would lead to significant improvements in serum Phe levels and potentially represent a curative therapy.
HMI-102: Our Gene Therapy Approach for PKU
 We identified HMI-102 as our lead product candidate after screening multiple vector constructs. HMI-102 consists of an AAVHSC15 vector containing the coding sequence of human PAH under control of a promoter designed to continuously express PAH, specifically in the liver. We chose AAVHSC15 as the basis of this product candidate because of its tropism for the liver, the normal site for PAH protein expression.
 In June 2019, we commenced enrollment of our Phase 1/2 pheNIX clinical trial with HMI-102, which is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational gene therapy in a randomized, concurrently controlled, dose-escalation study in adult patients aged 18–55 years old with classical PKU. The dose-escalation phase of the trial was designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of ascending doses of HMI-102 to enable the selection of a dose for the randomized, concurrently controlled Phase 2 portion of the trial, which was designed to have the potential to be converted to a registrational trial. We enrolled six patients in the dose-escalation phase across three dose cohorts: low-dose (2E13 vg/kg) Cohort 1, n=2; mid-dose (6E13 vg/kg) Cohort 2, n=2; high-dose (1E14 vg/kg) Cohort 3, n=2.
 In November 2020, we reported positive clinical data from the dose-escalation phase of the trial. Safety data from the six patients as of the cutoff date of October 19, 2020, showed HMI-102 was generally well-tolerated, and there were no treatment-related serious adverse events. There were no clinically significant changes in electrocardiogram or vital signs, no clinical signs of complement activation and no adverse events related to bilirubin. Alanine aminotransferase, or ALT, elevations, which are common in AAV-based gene therapy trials, were asymptomatic and managed with increased steroids when necessary. Efficacy data showed significant plasma Phe reductions in Cohorts 2 and 3, compared to Cohort 1 (P<0.004 post-hoc comparison using repeated measures MANOVA, or multivariate analysis of variance,/regression analysis), with two patients achieving target Phe levels per treatment guidelines, even while self-liberalizing diet. Compared to baseline, patients in Cohorts 2 and 3 also displayed Tyr increases and Phe-to-Tyr ratio decreases consistent with PAH enzymatic activity.
 Efficacy data from the two patients in Cohort 1 did not show any meaningful reductions in plasma Phe throughout the study. We believe this first and lowest dose in this dose-escalation study was insufficient to impact Phe levels. In Cohort 2, one patient experienced a marked Phe reduction from baseline level of 1,010 μmol/L, and recorded five plasma Phe values <360 μmol/L, and many of <600 μmol/L. The mean percentage change from baseline for this patient are reported in three categories: Phe, Tyr, and the Phe-to-Tyr ratio. For patients with PKU, the goal for a therapy is to lower Phe values, increase Tyr values and lower the overall Phe-to-Tyr ratio. As of the cutoff date, this patient’s mean percentage change from baseline showed a 48.6% reduction in plasma Phe, an 81.1% increase in Tyr and a 70.8% decrease in the Phe-to-Tyr ratio. We believe these results are consistent with an increase in PAH enzymatic activity and increased Phe metabolism. These results were observed even while the patient self-liberalized diet, including a mean percent change from baseline of more than a 100% increase in dietary Phe intake.
The other patient in Cohort 2 did not experience a similar reduction in plasma Phe, but this patient had pre-existing immune conditions and experienced Grade 3 ALT elevation, which we believe may have affected the results. As of the cutoff date, this patient had a mean percentage change from baseline of 13% increase in plasma Phe, with a 131.1% increase in Tyr and a 45.5% decrease in the Phe-to-Tyr ratio. This also occurred while the patient self-liberalized diet with a mean percent change from baseline of 140.5% more dietary intact protein, 289% more dietary Phe intake and 75.6% decreased dietary Tyr intake. We believe the findings in this patient may be suggestive of PAH enzymatic activity sufficient to increase the patient’s Tyr concentration from its low baseline, but not sufficient to reduce this patient’s Phe.
 In Cohort 3, Patient 5 had pre-existing underlying immune conditions, which we believe impacted efficacy. As of the data cutoff date, Patient 5 experienced an increase in the mean percentage change from baseline in Tyr of 22.6% and a reduction in the mean percentage change from baseline in the Phe-to-Tyr ratio of 25.4%, but did not experience a similar reduction in plasma Phe. We believe the findings in this patient may also be suggestive of PAH enzymatic activity, which was enough to improve Tyr, but not enough to reduce Phe.
 Patient 6 showed a marked reduction in Phe from baseline level of 1,060 μmol/L, and recorded one plasma Phe value <360 μmol/L and several plasma Phe values <600 μmol/L through the 13 weeks of observation as of the cutoff date. The mean percentage change from baseline was a 31.4% reduction in plasma Phe, a 40.3% increase in Tyr and a 52.4% decrease in the Phe-to-Tyr ratio. These results were observed while the patient self-liberalized diet, including a mean percent change from

baseline of more than 45.4% increase in dietary intact protein and a 41.8% increase in dietary Phe. This patient had the benefit of increased monitoring, which also allowed for tighter management of steroids, including additional steroids at the first observation of ALT increases.
 Based on the safety and efficacy results observed in the dose-escalation phase as of the cutoff date, in early 2021 we advanced to the Phase 2 randomized, concurrently controlled, expansion phase of the pheNIX trial, which has the potential to be converted to a registrational trial. We selected two doses for the expansion phase: 6E13 vg/kg and 8E13 vg/kg. In October 2021, we announced that as of September 30, 2021, both doses in the expansion phase of the trial have been generally well-tolerated and have shown evidence of biological activity, including clinically meaningful reductions in Phe levels, increases in Tyr and reductions in the Phe-to-Tyr ratio. On February 18, 2022, we announced our pheNIX gene therapy trial had been placed on clinical hold due to the need to modify risk-mitigation measures in the study in response to observations of elevated LFTs. On March 17, 2022, we received the official clinical hold letter from the FDA requesting information on elevated LFTs observed in some patients in the trial and modified clinical risk-mitigation measures. In patients who experienced elevated LFTs, all have resolved and no hospitalizations were required. Among the risk-mitigation methods that we intend to propose is a new, more targeted immunosuppressive regimen that is shorter in duration and includes a T-cell inhibitor used in combination with a steroid-sparing regimen that may improve patient compliance. The use of T-cell inhibitors has been shown to be effective in dampening the anticipated immune response to AAV capsids, which are commonly employed to deliver genetic medicines. With the additional information requested by the FDA and the planned conversion to a more targeted immunosuppressive regimen, we estimate that we will require more time to submit and receive feedback on our proposed clinical risk-mitigation strategy. As a result, we now expect to provide a program update when the path forward is established with the FDA.
 Preclinical Studies with HMI-102
 The potential of an AAVHSC15-delivered PAH gene was assessed in a well-established mouse model of PKU called the Pahenu2, or ENU2, mouse. This model contains a mutation in the murine Pah gene that results in abolished activity and elevated serum Phe levels. Baseline levels of serum Phe in these mice are approximately 1,500 micromoles per liter compared to normal levels of approximately 80 micromoles per liter, levels that are similar to those seen in classical PKU patients and normal controls, respectively. Single intravenous injections of HMI-102 into these PAH-deficient mice resulted in reductions of serum Phe to levels that are within the range for normal mice. As depicted in Figure 9, the reduction in serum Phe levels persisted for 48 weeks in treated mice on a normal protein diet, consistent with the lifespan of the model. In addition to a reduction in serum Phe, the administration of our gene therapy candidate also resulted in elevations of serum Tyr due to the restoration of the normal biochemical pathway.
 
Figure 9. A single injection of HMI-102 resulted in rapid and sustained reductions in serum Phe and increased Tyr levels in PAH-deficient mice that are on a regular diet.
A subsequent study was performed to further characterize the effect of HMI-102 on normalizing levels of Phe and neurotransmitter metabolism in the brain. As shown in Figure 10, a single administration of HMI-102 in the ENU2 mouse model reduced levels of Phe in the brain to normal levels as measured at 4 weeks post-dosing. Furthermore, the brain

concentrations of 5-HIAA, a metabolite of serotonin, was increased to normal levels. These results indicate that HMI-102 administration directly impacts the metabolic pathway associated with loss of PAH.

 Optimized HMI-103: Our Gene Editing Approach for PKU
 In order to address the pediatric PKU population, we are developing a gene editing candidate for PKU, optimized HMI-103, that is designed to replace defective PAH genes with normal copies. The gene editing vector transgene is flanked by left and right homology arms, containing sequences that are identical and specific to the genomic target. The arms were designed to integrate by non-nuclease-based, AAV-mediated HR into the target human PAH locus. This therapy aims to correct the genetic defect within the treated liver cells then directing the expression of the PAH protein. HR-based integration via AAVHSCs is highly precise, without the introduction of insertions, deletions or viral ITRs. The corrected copy of the PAH gene would be retained as cells divide into daughter cells as the liver grows. Screening for PKU of all newborns in the United States allows the identification of affected individuals before serious neurological complications develop. We believe our HR approach possesses the efficacy and durability characteristics that would be appropriate to treat PKU in newly identified patients. As we further develop our expertise in treating PKU by correcting the defective PAH gene in the liver, we intend to develop treatments for other inborn errors of metabolism in the liver.
We have conducted in vivo experiments showing the integration of a human PAH cDNA into the human PAH gene locus using a humanized liver mouse model. In this model, human hepatocytes constitute the majority of the liver cells, providing an in vivo model to test human specific editing constructs. Injection of the human AAVHSC PAH gene editing candidate in this model resulted in the insertion of a codon-optimized human PAH cDNA into the human PAH locus and mRNA expression of the PAH cDNA. The in vivo integration rate at the target locus, shown in Figure 11, was calculated at a frequency of 6%. This level of editing has been shown to be sufficient to normalize Phe levels in the murine model. A second assay was also performed on DNA that was specific for human and murine hepatocytes obtained from this study. The assay provides an orthogonal approach for characterizing the frequency of targeted integration and enables testing the species-selectivity of the targeted integration. The results of this assay showed integration only in the human hepatocytes and not in the murine hepatocytes, demonstrating selectivity for the human locus. Figure 12 below shows data following I.V. administration of the murine surrogate, or the murine version of HMI-103. The human construct is designed with human-specific homology arms, so a murine surrogate is necessary for testing in the PKU murine model. As depicted, we observed that PAH gene integration was durable out to 43 weeks (end of study) and resulted in marked and durable serum Phe reduction.


Figure 11. Human-specific AAVHSC PAH gene editing candidate resulted in a targeted integration rate of 6%, as measured by NGS in an in vivo humanized liver murine model.
 
Figure 12. I.V. administration of murine surrogate (with murine homology arms) of HMI-103 showed durable gene integration in Pahenu2 model of PKU.
 The fidelity of the integration of the cDNA into the target locus was evaluated by NGS sequencing. There were no de novo mutations detected in either homology arm target site. We also evaluated the samples for the presence of ITRs. Viral ITRs are non-homologous sequences that lie beyond the extent of the recombination event and thus should not be integrated into the target site. The integrated alleles were free of ITR sequence, consistent with HR as the main mechanism for integration. Together, these data showed that the targeted integration of the human PAH cDNA into the human PAH locus displayed sequence fidelity with no evidence of mutations. A genome wide integration assay using long read NGS was developed to assess for off-target HR-mediated integration in human hepatocytes. No off-target HR-mediated integration sites were detected above the limit of detection.
 Based on these data, in October 2021, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1 trial with HMI-103. The pheEDIT clinical trial is an open-label, dose escalation study evaluating the safety and efficacy of single I.V. administration of HMI-103, and is expected to enroll up to nine patients ages 18-55 years old who have been diagnosed with PKU due to PAH deficiency. In addition to safety endpoints, the trial will measure serum Phe changes. The trial incorporates an immunosuppressive regimen that includes a T-cell inhibitor used in combination with a steroid-sparing regimen. We expect that the first patient in the pheEDIT clinical trial will be dosed following requisite Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Review Board approvals at the clinical sites, and completion of an 82-day screening/run-in period to account for and more closely understand day-to-day Phe fluctuations of participants. If positive safety and efficacy results are established in adults, we then plan to enroll younger patients in clinical trials. We expect to provide an update on the pheEDIT clinical trial at the end of 2022.

Our CNS programs are designed to take advantage of our AAVHSCs’ natural ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier and blood-nerve-barrier in non-human primates.
HMI-203: Our Gene Therapy Approach for Hunter Syndrome
 In October 2021, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1 trial with HMI-203, an in vivo investigational gene therapy in development for the treatment of adults with MPS II or Hunter syndrome, a rare, X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the iduronate-2-sulfatase, or IDS, gene, which is responsible for producing the I2S enzyme that breaks down large sugar molecules, or cellular waste, called glycosaminoglycans, or GAGs. Severe Hunter syndrome results in toxic lysosomal accumulation of GAGs that causes progressive debilitation and decline in intellectual function. Hunter syndrome occurs in approximately 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 170,000 males, and the severe form leads to life expectancy of 10 to 20 years. We received orphan medicinal product designation and advanced therapy medicinal product classification from the EMA for HMI-203 for Hunter syndrome.
 The juMPStart clinical trial is an open-label, dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a single I.V. administration of HMI-203, and is expected to enroll up to nine male patients ages 18-30 years old who have been diagnosed with Hunter syndrome and are currently receiving enzyme replacement therapy. In addition to safety endpoints, the trial will measure plasma I2S activity, urinary GAG levels and other peripheral disease manifestations. Qualitative data on unmet medical needs from ERT-treated adult MPS II patients and/or their caregivers helped inform our trial design. Patients and caregivers reported that weekly ERT infusions, surgeries and supportive therapies inadequately address range of motion and mobility, pain, and hearing loss, that there are burdens associated with ERT and other therapies, including frequency and duration of treatment, and painful and extended recoveries, that there is a high degree of anxiety regarding prognosis, longevity, need for more invasive surgeries, and financial challenges and that the expectations for a potential one-time gene therapy include the ability to maintain their current quality of life with ERT independence. Also, key opinion leaders surveyed supported our planned design for the juMPStart clinical trial, including our plan to discontinue ERT. We expect to provide an update on the juMPStart clinical trial at the end of 2022.
 The standard of care for treating Hunter syndrome is enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT, which can delay some complications but does not treat CNS manifestations of Hunter syndrome since the enzyme cannot cross the blood-brain-barrier. In 2006, the recombinant form of human I2S (Elaprase), an ERT for the treatment of Hunter syndrome was approved by the FDA and subsequently approved for use internationally. In January 2021, the recombinant form of idursulfase-beta (Hunterase), an ERT for the treatment of Hunter syndrome received manufacturing and marketing approval in Japan and in March 2021, pabinafusp alfa, a recombinant iduronate-2-sulfatase ERT that delivers therapeutics across the blood-brain barrier was approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan and has been marketed since May 2021 under the brand name “IZCARGO® I.V. Infusion 10mg.” However, specific treatment to address the neurological manifestations of Hunter syndrome and prevent or stabilize cognitive decline remains a significant unmet medical need outside of Japan.
Development candidate HMI-203 is a potential one-time AAVHSC treatment designed to deliver functional copies of the IDS gene to multiple target organs, including the PNS and CNS, following a single I.V. administration. In preclinical studies, a single I.V. administration of HMI-203 led to robust biodistribution and sustained human I2S (hI2S) enzyme expression, which resulted in significant reductions in key Hunter syndrome biomarkers of heparan sulfate GAGs and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) in the brain, liver, heart, spleen, lungs and kidneys compared with the vehicle. Significant reductions in heparan sulfate GAGs in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared with vehicle were also observed, as well as ameliorated paw deformities, as shown by significant changes in measurements of ankle depth, paw width, paw depth and ankle width compared with vehicle. Finally, HMI-203 administration led to uptake of hI2S from the serum of the HMI-203-treated model in human cell lines, which demonstrated the potential for cell cross-correction. These data were presented at WORLDSymposium in 2021 and 2022. Refer to Figure 13 below.



Figure 13. Single IV administration of HMI-203 demonstrated systemic expression, reduction of GAGs, and correction of phenotype in murine model.
 HMI-202: Our Gene Therapy Approach for MLD
 We have completed IND-enabling studies with HMI-202, our product development candidate for MLD, and we are using these data to further optimize an HMI-202 vector that we believe may lead to a better therapeutic profile. MLD is a lysosomal storage disease caused by mutation of a gene called arylsulfatase A, or ARSA. The protein ARSA is required for the breakdown of cellular metabolic products that in MLD accumulate in all cells of the body. Cells responsible for the production of myelin are especially sensitive to the toxic build-up of these cellular metabolic products, leading to progressive serious neurological deterioration. The late infantile form of MLD, which is the most common form, includes rapidly progressive motor and cognitive decline and loss of vision. The majority of these patients do not survive past the first decade of life.
In the United States, stem cell transplants are currently the only effective treatment for MLD, but have significant drawbacks, including the use of immunosuppression therapy, delayed onset of ARSA expression post-engraftment, conditioning regimens, and the risk of death from the stem cell transplant. In Europe, Libmeldy (autologous CD34+ cells encoding the ARSA gene), a lentiviral vector-based gene therapy for the treatment of MLD, became the first therapy approved for eligible patients with early-onset MLD in December 2020 following receipt of full (standard) market authorization by the European Commission.
 We have generated preclinical data showing that a single intravenous dose of HMI-202 crossed the blood-brain-barrier and blood-nerve-barrier in a murine model and NHPs, shown in Figure 14, and had broad tissue tropism in physiologically relevant regions of the CNS and PNS, resulting in increased human ARSA enzyme activity to levels well above the therapeutic threshold when compared to average adult human enzyme activity. It is believed that levels of enzyme activity of 10 to 15% of

normal could potentially be curative, based on human data from healthy subjects with enzyme activity levels in this range. These data were presented at WORLDSymposium in 2021.
 
Figure 14. Single IV administration of HMI-202 crossed blood-brain-barrier and resulted in broad tissue tropism and therapeutically relevant levels of ARSA activity in the CNS of treated non-human primates.
 Single IV administration of HMI-202 in the murine Arsa knockout model resulted in a reduction of LAMP-1 accumulation in the spinal cord and a reduction of sulfatide in the brain, both at 52 weeks post-dose (refer to Figure 15 below).

Figure 15. Single IV administration of HMI-202 resulted in reduction of LAMP-1 accumulation (52 weeks post-treatment) and reduction in sulfatide accumulation (52 weeks post-treatment) in murine model.
HMI-104: Our Gene Therapy Approach for PNH
 In August 2021, we named a clinical development candidate for PNH, HMI-104, from our GTx-mAb platform. This platform represents an additional way that we are leveraging our AAVHSCs to deliver one-time in vivo gene therapy to express and secrete antibodies from the liver, which we believe may allow us to target diseases with larger patient populations. In support of this program, we generated and presented preclinical data targeting complement protein 5, demonstrating proof-of-concept in PNH. Our data showed that a single I.V. dose of an AAVHSC GTx-mAb showed expression of full-length antibodies from the liver consistent with anti-C5 therapeutic levels, sustained and robust IgG expression in vivo in a humanized murine humanized liver model and a murine NOD-SCID model and in vivo vector-expressed C5 mAb had potent functional activity as shown by an ex vivo hemolysis assay.

 Other CNS Diseases
 We believe our gene therapy technology has the potential to address other CNS diseases, including Friedreich’s ataxia or FA. In FA, mutations in a gene called frataxin, or FXN, lead to progressive deterioration of the spinal cord leading to difficulty walking and eventual complete incapacitation and shortened lifespan. Other CNS diseases include Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, or CMT, a group of disorders that affect the peripheral nerves, the nerves running from outside the brain and spine. The primary clinical features of this disease are slowly progressive distal weakness, muscle atrophy affecting the feet and legs and sensory loss. We also believe our gene therapy technology capable of confronting frontotemporal disorders, or forms of dementia caused by a family of brain diseases known as frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Dementia is a severe loss of thinking abilities that interferes with a person’s ability to perform daily activities such as working, driving, and preparing meals. Finally, in addition to Hunter syndrome, for which we are currently advancing product development candidate HMI-203, our technology has the potential to address other lysosomal storage disorders.
Other Liver Diseases and Therapeutics
 We continue to pursue the liver as a target organ given the high tropism of our AAVHSCs and the initial clinical data we have collected via our pheNIX Phase 1/2 gene therapy trial for PKU. We are pursuing potential treatments that target the liver’s ability to secrete proteins into the serum. We believe that by targeting the liver with genetic medicines that act via gene therapy or gene editing, there is the potential to provide long-lasting secretion of proteins. We plan to name a development program in this therapeutic area in 2021.
 Hemoglobinopathies
We are also pursuing treatment of diseases that affect blood cells such as sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia using our AAVHSC vector HR technology. We believe that our potential ability to correct the defective beta globin gene in blood precursor cells may lead to long-term functional cures for affected patients. Sickle cell disease affects over 100,000 individuals and beta thalassemia over 1,000 individuals in the United States.
Ophthalmological Diseases
A number of serious, but rare diseases of the eye such as Leber’s congenital amaurosis and Choroideremia, as well as more common diseases such as macular degeneration, have been targeted using gene therapy approaches by academic groups as well as the pharmaceutical industry. We evaluated the ability of our AAVHSCs to transduce retinal cells following subretinal injection in preclinical studies in mice. Expression of green fluorescent protein, or GFP, was seen in all layers of the retina including the retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptors and the outer nuclear layer, and the AAVHSC subretinal treatment was well-tolerated. In addition, we evaluated the ability of AAVHSC17 to transduce retinal cells in a larger animal model, a mini-pig, and observed significant transduction of all layers of the retina supporting translation across two species. We believe these studies suggest that our AAVHSCs have the potential to be useful as therapeutic vectors for treating retinal diseases in humans based on significant tropism to these target cells. We believe that these vectors have the potential to deliver long-lasting therapeutic benefit to patients that may eliminate the need for the regular and burdensome intravitreal injections that are required for many current treatments.
 Manufacturing
As a company committed to curing diseases, the ability to deliver our novel therapeutic vectors to patients is critical. Therefore, we have built strong scientific AAV process development and manufacturing capabilities to support our clinical development programs. We have established a commercial manufacturing platform and process that supports both gene therapy and gene editing, which is scalable from preclinical to GMP. Our process development and manufacturing strategy leverages a single platform for both gene therapy and gene editing that is scalable and facilitates rapid development to the clinic. Our development focus includes design and engineering of plasmid constructs, cell culture, transfection, purification, formulation and analytical development. We leverage our manufacturing platform across our entire pipeline, from our research programs, to our preclinical programs and now to our clinical programs. Our platform was designed from its inception to be our commercial process, allowing us to rapidly transition from research into the clinic and eventually to commercialization. Our manufacturing platform has been scaled and tested across more than 450 different constructs with more than 550 unique lots of vector successfully executed.
 Our manufacturing strategy utilizes mammalian cells for our AAVHSC vector-based product candidates. All of our programs utilize HEK293 transfection in a serum-free suspension bioreactor process. HEK293 is a well-characterized and commonly used system for many clinical-stage AAV vector products. Additionally, HEK293 cells are familiar to regulatory authorities, and commercial raw materials and reagents are readily available. Our purification leverages chromatography-based operations to provide high quality vector and ensure robust commercial-scale operations. In addition to our process development, we also internally developed 45 analytical methods to test, monitor, and characterize our products. Expertise and learnings will be leveraged across gene therapy and gene editing programs.
 Oxford Biomedica Solutions Transaction
  On March 10, 2022, we closed our previously announced transaction with Oxford Biomedica Solutions LLC (f/k/a Roadrunner Solutions LLC), or OXB Solutions, Oxford Biomedica (US), Inc., or OXB, and Oxford Biomedica plc, or OXB Parent, and collectively with OXB, Oxford, pursuant to the Equity Securities Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, dated as of January 28, 2022, by and among Homology, OXB Solutions and Oxford, whereby, among other things, we and Oxford have agreed to collaborate to operate OXB Solutions, which will provide AAV vector process development and manufacturing to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which we refer to as the Oxford Biomedica Solutions Transaction, or the OXB Solutions Transaction. OXB Solutions incorporates our proven 'plug and play' process development and manufacturing platform, as well as our experienced team and high-quality GMP vector production capabilities that we built and have been operating since 2019. We will continue to leverage these process development and manufacturing capabilities while reducing our costs and maintaining dedicated manufacturing capacity to support our product candidates. We believe the quality, reliability and scalability of our gene therapy and gene editing manufacturing approach is a core competitive advantage crucial to our long-term success.
 Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement and a contribution agreement, or the Contribution Agreement, entered into between us and OXB Solutions prior to the closing of the OXB Solutions Transaction, or the Closing, we agreed to assign and transfer to OXB Solutions all of our assets that are primarily used in the manufacturing of AAV vectors for use in gene therapy or gene editing products, but excluding certain assets related to manufacturing or testing of our proprietary AAV vectors, or collectively, the Transferred Assets, in exchange for 175,000 common equity units in OXB Solutions, or Units, and OXB Solutions assumed from us, and agreed to pay, perform and discharge when due, all of our duties, obligations, liabilities, interests and commitments of any kind under, arising out of or relating to the Transferred Assets.


Effective as of the Closing, we sold to OXB, and OXB purchased from us, 130,000 Units, or the Transferred Units, in exchange for $130.0 million. In connection with the Closing, OXB contributed $50.0 million in cash to OXB Solutions in exchange for an additional 50,000 Units. Immediately following the Closing, (i) OXB owned 180,000 Units, representing 80 percent (80%) of the fully diluted equity interests in OXB Solutions, and (ii) we owned 45,000 Units, representing 20 percent (20%) of the fully diluted equity interests in OXB Solutions.
 Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of OXB Solutions, or the OXB Solutions Operating Agreement, which was executed in connection with the Closing, at any time following the three-year anniversary of the Closing, (i) OXB will have an option to cause us to sell and transfer to OXB, and (ii) we will have an option to cause OXB to purchase from us, in each case all of our equity ownership interest in OXB Solutions at a price equal to 5.5 times the revenue for the immediately preceding 12-month period, subject to a specified maximum amount. Pursuant to the terms of the OXB Solutions Operating Agreement, we will be entitled to designate one director on the Board of Directors of OXB Solutions, which shall initially be Arthur Tzianabos, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Further, Tim Kelly, our former Chief Operating Officer, now serves as the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of OXB Solutions.
 Concurrently with the Closing, we entered into certain ancillary agreements with OXB Solutions including a license and patent management agreement whereby OXB Solutions granted certain licenses to us, a supply agreement for a term of three years which includes certain annual minimum purchase commitments, a lease assignment pursuant to which we assigned all of our right, title and interest in, to and under our facility lease to OXB Solutions, a sublease agreement whereby OXB Solutions subleased certain premises in its facility to us, as well as several additional ancillary agreements.
 Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in the gene therapy and gene editing fields, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property and proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions that conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on gene therapy and/or gene editing technologies, any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that utilize technologies encompassing genomic medicines to create therapies, including gene therapy and gene editing. There are additional companies that are working to develop therapies in areas related to our research programs.
 Our platform and product focus is the development of genetic medicines using our proprietary AAVHSCs in vivo either through the gene therapy or nuclease-free gene editing modality. If our current programs are approved for the indications for which we are currently planning clinical trials, they may compete with other products currently under development, including gene therapy and gene editing products or other types of therapies, such as small molecule, antibody or protein therapies. If our PKU treatments are approved, they may compete with therapies from American Gene Technologies, BioMarin, Generation Bio, Moderna, Nestlé Health Science, PTC Therapeutics, Jnana Therapeutics and Synlogic. However, we believe that only gene therapy or gene editing approaches have the potential to restore the normal Phe biochemical pathway with a single administration. As such, the major competition in this space may be limited to American Gene Technologies and BioMarin, both of which are behind our development program according to public filings.
 There are a number of companies developing nuclease-based gene editing technologies using CRISPR/Cas9, TALENs, meganucleases, Mega-TALs and ZFNs, including Beam Therapeutics, bluebird bio, Caribou Biosciences, Cellectis, CRISPR Therapeutics, Editas Medicine, Intellia Therapeutics, Precision BioSciences and Sangamo Therapeutics and non-nuclease-based technology, including LogicBio Therapeutics.
 If our Hunter syndrome treatment is approved, it may compete with approved products such as IZCARGO(R), a blood-brain-barrier-penetrating recombinant iduronate-2-sulfatase approved in Japan, as well as investigational product candidates from Avrobio, Denali Therapeutics and REGENXBIO, and ERTs from Takeda and/or GC Pharma. However, we believe that only a gene editing approach has the potential to address the neurological manifestations of Hunter syndrome and prevent or stabilize cognitive decline.


If our MLD treatment is approved, it may compete with approved products such as Libmeldy, a lentiviral vector-based ex vivo gene therapy approved in the EU and a select group of additional countries for the treatment of MLD from Orchard Therapeutics, as well as investigational product candidates from Takeda and Passage Bio. We believe that our in vivo gene therapy approach for MLD could be used early in the disease progression with the potential for earlier protein expression, offering advantages over Orchard Therapeutics' ex vivo approach, as well as advantages over chronic, intrathecal ERTs, such as Takeda’s approach.
 In addition, many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience and availability of reimbursement.
Furthermore, we rely upon a combination of patents and trade secret protection, as well as license and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our proprietary technologies, product candidate development programs and product development candidates. Our success depends in large part on our ability to secure and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to HMI-102 and any future product development candidates. Moreover, our industry is characterized by the existence of large numbers of patents and frequent allegations of patent infringement. If, therefore, we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products or if the scope of the patent protection obtained or in-licensed is not sufficiently broad or if the validity of such patent is threatened, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets, as it could create opportunities for competitors to enter the market or dissuade other companies from collaborating with us to develop products and technology, any of which would hurt our competitive position and could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product development candidates in any indication for which they are approved. For more information regarding these competitive risks, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in large part upon our ability to secure and maintain proprietary protection for our technologies and products and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing, or collaborating with our licensors to file, U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements and trademarks that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We require employees who are inventors on any company-owned patent applications to assign the rights to us. Also, we use other forms of protection, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We rely on trade secrets, technical know-how, and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive advantage. In addition, we rely on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and other advisors to protect our proprietary information. Our policy is to require third parties that receive material confidential information to enter into confidentiality agreements with us.
 Our patent portfolio includes a combination of issued patents and pending patent applications that are licensed from third parties. As of December 31, 2021, we have an exclusive license or co-exclusive license under 18 United States issued patents, nine foreign patents and 52 patent applications, pending in the United States and internationally.
For any individual patent, the term depends on the applicable law in the country in which the patent is granted. In most countries where we have filed patent applications or in-licensed patents and patent applications, patents have a term of 20 years from the application filing date or earliest claimed non-provisional priority date. In the United States, the patent term is 20 years but may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent that expires earlier. The term of a U.S. patent may also be lengthened by a patent term adjustment, in order to address administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent.

In the United States, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biologic may be eligible for patent term extension in order to restore the period of a patent term lost during the premarket FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the natural expiration of the patent. The patent term restoration period is generally equal to the regulatory review period for the approved product which period occurs after the date the patent issued, subject to certain exceptions. Only one patent may be extended for a regulatory review period for any product, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In the future, we may decide to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to extend its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant Biologics License Application, or BLA. Similarly, certain foreign jurisdictions also have mechanisms for extending patent term and, to the extent we have granted patents that are eligible, we may decide to apply for patent term extensions in those jurisdictions.
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally equal to the regulatory review period for the approved product which period occurs after the date the patent issued, subject to certain exceptions. Only one patent may be extended for a regulatory review period for any product, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to extend its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
For patents that might expire during the BLA review phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent term extension. If eligible, an interim patent term extension may be granted for a period of not more than one year. The patent owner may apply for not more than four subsequent interim extensions. Any interim extension granted will not be longer than the maximum period of extension allowed post-approval.
 Licensed Intellectual Property
Certain of our issued patents and pending patent applications are exclusively licensed to us in all fields of use from COH. Certain of our issued patents and pending patent applications are co-exclusively licensed to us in all human therapeutic applications with and from the California Institute of Technology, or Caltech.
The City of Hope Portfolio
In April 2016, we exclusively licensed two families of patents and patent applications directed to novel AAV capsids and their manufacture and methods of use, including their use in genome editing from COH.
These two families of patents and patent applications together include eleven granted patents in the United States, four foreign granted patents, and 15 pending applications in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and other selected countries in Latin America and Asia. The first family of issued patents and patent applications is material to HMI-102 and relates to our novel AAV vectors and their use in cellular transduction. The nine issued U.S. patents in this family are expected to expire in 2031 and may be extended by up to five years in the United States via patent term extension depending on the regulatory pathway of the products covered by such patents. The second family includes two issued U.S. patents relating to our AAV vectors and their use in genome editing. The issued patents in this family are expected to expire in 2035 and may be extended by up to five years in the United States and in certain other countries via patent term extension depending on the regulatory pathway of the products covered by such patents.
The Caltech Portfolio
In September 2016, we co-exclusively licensed, with another commercial third party, two families of patents and patent applications directed to novel AAV capsids and vectors that demonstrate enhanced blood-brain-barrier penetration for the potential treatment of CNS diseases from Caltech.

These families of patents and patent applications include seven granted patents in the United States, two granted patents in Europe, one granted patent each in Colombia, Russia and South Africa, and 19 pending applications in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and other selected countries in Latin America and Asia. The seven issued U.S. patents relate to novel AAV capsids and vectors and are expected to expire in 2034. Certain other patent applications directed to novel AAV capsids and vectors, if they were to issue, may have later expirations.
Trademarks
Our trademarks Homology Medicines, HMI, the H logo, the HOMOLOGY MEDICINES, INC. logo and AMENDR, are pending or registered in the United States and/or certain international countries. We currently own two registered trademarks and two pending trademark applications in the United States, 29 registered trademarks around the world, and 14 pending foreign trademark applications.
Strategic Collaborations
 Collaboration and License Agreement with the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc.
In November 2017, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Novartis, pursuant to which we agreed to collaborate on researching, developing, and commercializing novel genome editing products that modulate certain gene targets. On February 26, 2021, we received notice from Novartis that they had elected to terminate the agreement with respect to the ophthalmic target, which was the only remaining target under the agreement. Accordingly, the notice served as notice of Novartis’ termination of the agreement in its entirety, with an effective date of August 26, 2021. Under the terms of the agreement, Novartis was obligated to continue to reimburse the Company for certain research and development costs through August 26, 2021. Upon effectiveness of the termination, such reimbursements ceased. As a result of this notice, we regained worldwide exclusive rights from Novartis to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize our proprietary nuclease-free gene editing technology platform for the ophthalmic target. The companies believe that results of studies conducted under the agreement provide early proof-of-principle and support a nuclease-independent approach to editing of relevant cell types in the eye after sub-retinal injection.
 License Agreement with the California Institute of Technology
In September 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Caltech, pursuant to which Caltech granted us a co-exclusive (subject to certain reserved non-commercial rights), sublicensable, and worldwide license under certain AAV-related patents owned by Caltech for human therapeutic applications. Under this agreement, Caltech also granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by Caltech to develop, manufacture, commercialize, and otherwise exploit products covered by such intellectual property rights for human therapeutic applications. We may grant sublicenses under the non-exclusive license to third parties to the extent necessary or useful for our, or our sublicensees’, development, manufacturing, or sale of such products.
Under the Caltech agreement, we paid Caltech an initial licensing fee of $100,000. We are also required to pay Caltech up to a total of $7.2 million in milestone payments for the first licensed product; royalties, in the low single-digit percentages on net sales of licensed products, subject to a certain annual minimum royalty; and mid to high single-digit percentages of sublicensing revenues. Subject to certain exceptions, our royalty obligations under the agreement continue on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the earliest of (a) the date on which such licensed product is no longer covered by certain intellectual property rights, (b) 10 years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product, or (c) 15 years after the effective date of the agreement. As partial consideration for the licenses granted under the agreement, we issued 101,405 shares of our common stock to Caltech.
The agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire patent that is licensed to us or as long as royalties are due under the agreement, whichever is later. We agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to introduce commercially, and reasonably fulfill market demand for, licensed products as soon as practicable. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach and in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency. We may terminate the agreement for convenience.
City of Hope License Agreement
In April 2016, we entered into a license agreement with COH, pursuant to which COH granted us an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to certain AAV vector-related patents and know-how owned by COH to develop, manufacture, use and commercialize products and services covered by such patents and know-how in any and all fields. COH

also granted us a non-exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to certain background patents owned by COH to develop, manufacture, use and commercialize licensed products and licensed services in any and all fields.
Under the agreement, we paid COH an initial licensing fee of $75,000, and made a subsequent payment of $4.5 million representing a percentage of sublicensing revenue. We are also required to pay COH an annual license maintenance fee; up to a total of $3.2 million in potential milestone fees; a royalty in the low single-digit percentages on net sales of licensed products or services, subject to certain reductions in certain circumstances, with a certain annual minimum royalty; and low double-digit percentages of sublicensing revenues. As partial consideration for the licenses granted under the agreement, we issued 154,837 shares of our common stock to COH.
The COH agreement will expire on a country-by-country and on a licensed patent-by-licensed patent basis upon the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of such patent in such country. We agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products and licensed services. If we fail to achieve certain diligence milestones, COH may terminate the agreement or convert the exclusive rights under the agreement from exclusive to non-exclusive. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s material breach, subject to an opportunity to cure, and in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency. We may terminate the agreement for convenience.
On August 6, 2021, the Company received notice from COH that it did not accomplish at least one of the partnering milestones by the applicable deadline, as set forth in the COH license. This notice does not affect the Company's exclusive license in the field of mammalian therapeutics, including all human therapeutics, associated diagnostics, and target validation, (the "Mammalian Therapeutic Field"), where the Company retains exclusive rights. Instead, the notice served as written notice that the exclusive license granted pursuant to the COH license in all fields except the Mammalian Therapeutic Field converted from exclusive to non-exclusive effective as of September 20, 2021, which was forty-five days from the receipt of notice. In connection with the conversion, any royalty obligations and sublicensee fees relating to fields outside of the Mammalian Therapeutic Field shall be reduced by a certain percentage. This change to the Company's exclusive worldwide license with COH does not impact any of its current therapeutic product development candidates in development, including HMI-102, HMI-103, HMI-203, HMI-202 and HMI-104, nor will it impact any potential future therapeutic product development candidates.
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
Governmental authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting and export and import of products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, are extensive and require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. For the purposes of this Section, the term “gene therapy” includes both traditional gene therapy products as well as gene editing and our gene integration product candidates.
FDA Approval Process
We expect our future product candidates to be regulated as biologics. Biological products, including gene therapy products, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FDCA and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, safety, testing, packaging, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of biological products.
We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Biological Products Development Process
The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive nonclinical, sometimes referred to as preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including good laboratory practices, or GLP, requirements; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and any additional requirements needed for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use; 
 •preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
 •completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with GMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 
 •FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA. 
 Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product candidate, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP.
The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing and controls, information about product chemistry, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug to humans. Some preclinical testing, such as reproductive toxicity tests and carcinogenicity in animals, may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, after which human clinical trials may begin unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin.
In addition to the IND submission process, under the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, the efficacy measurements to be evaluated and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all

research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB or ethics committee at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or a data monitoring committee, which provides guidance for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase I. The biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
 •Phase II. The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
 •Phase III. The biological product candidate is further evaluated for dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may also be made a condition to approval of the BLA.
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other trials, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or permanently discontinue a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with FDA regulations. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA and the IRB may also halt, terminate or impose other conditions if either believes the patients are subject to unacceptable risk.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

U.S. Review and Approval Processes
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing and distribution of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal trials, human trials, information on the manufacture, pharmacology, chemistry and controls of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for marketed products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first human drug application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews the submitted BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. Under PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals to complete the review of BLAs. For example, the FDA may give a priority review to BLAs submitted for biological products that are designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would offer a significant improvement in safety or efficacy compared to marketed products. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the current PDUFA agreement, these six- and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for original BLAs, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission.
The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with GMP requirements to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with GCP.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA, conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced and conducts inspections at select clinical sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.


If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its potential risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product.
Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved BLA, including changes in indications, product labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs. The FDA may require one or more Phase IV post-market studies or surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Orphan Drug Designation
The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from its sales in the United States. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and BLA user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application, including a full BLA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same disease or condition for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan-designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of a product for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if such product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program
 In 2012, Congress authorized the FDA to award priority review vouchers to sponsors of certain rare pediatric disease product applications. This program is designed to encourage development of new drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of certain rare pediatric diseases. Specifically, under this program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for a “rare pediatric disease” may qualify for a voucher that can be redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. The sponsor of a rare pediatric disease drug product receiving a priority review voucher may transfer (including by sale) the voucher to another sponsor. The voucher may be further transferred any number of times before the voucher is used, as long as the sponsor making the transfer has not yet submitted the application. The FDA may also revoke any priority review voucher if the rare pediatric disease drug for which the voucher was awarded is not marketed in the U.S. within one year following the date of approval.


For purposes of this program, a “rare pediatric disease” is a (a) serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents; and (b) rare diseases or conditions within the meaning of the Orphan Drug Act. Congress has only authorized the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program until September 30, 2024. Consequently, sponsors of marketing applications approved after that date will not receive the voucher unless Congress reauthorizes the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program before that time. However, even if the program is not reauthorized, if a drug candidate receives Rare Pediatric Disease Designation before October 1, 2024, the sponsor of the marketing application for such drug will be eligible to receive a voucher if the application for the designated drug is approved by the FDA before October 1, 2026.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a biologic product candidate may request that the FDA designate the biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. The FDA must determine if the biologic product candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. With regard to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
  A biological product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A biologic can receive Breakthrough Therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the biologic, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
 Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for marketing, including a product candidate with a Fast Track designation or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A BLA is eligible for priority review if the biological product candidate has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Biological product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval, which means that such product candidates be approved on the FDA's determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing Phase IV clinical studies to verify the predicted clinical benefit. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or to confirm a clinical benefit during such post-marketing trials, will allow the FDA to withdraw the approved biologic product from the market on an expedited basis. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 Moreover in 2017, the FDA established the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designation as part of its implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act. An investigational drug is eligible for RMAT designation if: (1) it meets the definition of a regenerative medicine therapy, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (2) it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious disease or condition; and (3) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the investigational drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. In a February 2019 final guidance, the FDA also stated that certain gene therapies that lead to a sustained effect on cells or tissues may meet the definition of a regenerative medicine therapy. RMAT designation provides potential benefits that include more frequent

meetings with FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate, and eligibility for rolling review of BLAs and priority review. Product candidates granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval if the relevant statutory conditions are met.
 Fast Track designation, priority review, RMAT designation and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if we receive one or both of these designations for our product candidates, the FDA may later decide that our product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification. In addition, receiving these designations may not provide us with a material commercial advantage.
Post-Approval Requirements
Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP requirements, record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHS Act also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend biologics licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases within the United States.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties.

Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims and transparency laws and regulations regarding drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physician and other licensed healthcare professionals. If their operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. Moreover, for drugs and biologics administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such products. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales.
Healthcare Reform
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each as amended, or ACA, was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contained a

number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and fraud and abuse changes. Additionally, the ACA:
•increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; 
 •required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; 
 •required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 70 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and 
 •imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which was temporarily suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Data Privacy and Security Laws
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information and could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and also the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Additional Regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
Government Regulation Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we may be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions, for instance in the European Union, or EU, governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorizations, post-marketing authorization requirements and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
In addition, ethical, social and legal concerns about gene-editing technology, gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Non-clinical Studies and Clinical Trials
 Similarly to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.
 Non-clinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new chemical or biological substances. Non-clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the principles of good laboratory practice, or GLP, as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC. In particular, non-clinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for non-clinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements.
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Additional GCP guidelines from the European Commission, focusing in particular on traceability, apply to clinical trials of advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU member states, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
 The regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation, or CTR, which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member states without the need for member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal and database.
 While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application, or CTA, to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB respectively, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well,

including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed.
 The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. For clinical trials whose CTA was made under the Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2022, the Clinical Trials Directive will continue to apply on a transitional basis for three years. Additionally, sponsors may still choose to submit a CTA under either the Clinical Trials Directive or the CTR until January 31, 2023 and, if authorized, those will be governed by the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. By that date, all ongoing trials will become subject to the provisions of the CTR.
 Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP. Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
 During the development of a medicinal product, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and national regulators provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical trials, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Advice is not legally binding with regard to any future marketing authorization application of the product concerned.
 Marketing Authorization
 In the EU, medicinal products can only be placed on the market after obtaining a marketing authorization, or MA. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biological product in the EU, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product. There are two types of MAs.
 “Centralized MAs” are issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the EMA’s CHMP, and are valid across the entire territory of the EU. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain types of product candidates such as: (i) medicinal products derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) designated orphan medicines and (iv) ATMPs such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure is optional for product candidates containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for product candidates that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. It is very likely that the centralized procedure would apply to the products we are developing.
 The Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, is responsible in conjunction with the CHMP for the evaluation of ATMPs. The CAT is primarily responsible for the scientific evaluation of ATMPs and prepares a draft opinion on the quality, safety and efficacy of each ATMP for which a MAA is submitted. The CAT’s opinion is then considered by the CHMP when giving its final recommendation regarding the authorization of a product in view of the balance of benefits and risks identified. Although the CAT’s draft opinion is submitted to the CHMP for final approval, the CHMP may depart from the draft opinion, if it provides detailed scientific justification. The CHMP and CAT are also responsible for providing guidelines on ATMPs and have published numerous guidelines, including specific guidelines on gene therapies and cell therapies. These guidelines provide additional guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation to the development and evaluation of ATMPs and include, among other things, the preclinical studies required to characterize ATMPs; the manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a marketing authorization application; and post-approval measures required to monitor patients and evaluate the long term efficacy and potential adverse reactions of ATMPs.
 Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA by the EMA is 210 days. This excludes so-called clock stops, during which additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. At the end of the review period, the CHMP provides an opinion to the European Commission. If this opinion is favorable, the Commission may then adopt a decision to grant an MA.
 In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of a MAA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops). Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may

be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the PRIME scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted, but this is however not guaranteed. Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the CHMP is appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s committee level. An initial meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
 “National MAs” are issued by the competent authorities of the EU member states, only cover their respective territory, and are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU member state, this national MA can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member state through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the national competent authority of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference member state.
 MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. Once renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period unless the European Commission or the national competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal.
 Moreover, in the EU, a “conditional” MA may be granted in cases where all the required safety and efficacy data are not yet available. The conditional MA is subject to conditions to be fulfilled for generating the missing data or ensuring increased safety measures. It is valid for one year and has to be renewed annually until fulfillment of all the conditions. Once the pending studies are provided, it can become a “standard” MA. However, if the conditions are not fulfilled within the timeframe set by the EMA, the MA ceases to be renewed. Furthermore, MA may also be granted “under exceptional circumstances” when the applicant can show that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use even after the product has been authorized and subject to specific procedures being introduced. This may arise in particular when the intended indications are very rare and, in the present state of scientific knowledge, it is not possible to provide comprehensive information, or when generating data may be contrary to generally accepted ethical principles. This MA is close to the conditional MA as it is reserved to medicinal products to be approved for severe diseases or unmet medical needs and the applicant does not hold the complete data set legally required for the grant of a MA. However, unlike the conditional MA, the applicant does not have to provide the missing data and will never have to. Although the MA “under exceptional circumstances” is granted definitively, the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product is reviewed annually and the MA is withdrawn in case the risk-benefit ratio is no longer favorable.
 Data and Marketing Exclusivity
 The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Upon receiving a MA, reference products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial MA of the reference product in the EU. The overall ten-year market exclusivity period may be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU regulatory authorities to be a new chemical or biological entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
 There is a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw materials or manufacturing processes. For such products, the results of appropriate preclinical or clinical trials must be provided, and guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product. There are no such guidelines for complex biological products, such as gene or cell therapy medicinal products, and so it is unlikely that biosimilars of those products will currently be approved in the European Union. However, guidance from the

EMA states that they will be considered in the future in light of the scientific knowledge and regulatory experience gained at the time.
 Orphan Medicinal Products
 The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU are similar in principle to those in the United States. A medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.
 The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the MAA. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers, protocol assistance, and access to the centralized procedure. Upon grant of an MA, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During the ten-year market exclusivity period, the regulatory authorities cannot accept a MAA, or grant a MA, or accept an application to extend a MA, for the same indication, in respect of a similar medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for orphan medicinal products that have also complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan, or PIP. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity or where the prevalence of the condition has increased above the threshold. Additionally, an MA may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if (1) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (2) the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (3) the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
Pediatric Development
 In the EU, MAAs for new medicinal products have to include the results of trials conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a PIP agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which an MA is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data are not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the MA is obtained in all member states and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for a six-months supplementary protection certificate extension (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan pharmaceutical products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity is granted.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the member states. The holder of a MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
 All new MAAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
 The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU.

Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one country to another.
Failure to comply with EU and member state laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, MA of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials, or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
The United Kingdom, or UK, left the EU on January 31, 2020, following which existing EU medicinal product legislation continued to apply in the UK during the transition period under the terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. The transition period, which ended on December 31, 2020, maintained access to the EU single market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. The transition period provided time for the UK and EU to negotiate a framework for partnership for the future, which was then crystallized in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or TCA, and became effective on the January 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
