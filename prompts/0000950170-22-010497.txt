 Item 1. Business
 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
 This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 relating to our future operations and prospects, including statements that are based on current projections and expectations about the markets in which we operate, and management's beliefs concerning future performance and capital requirements based upon current available information. Such statements are based on management's beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management. When used in this document, words like "may," "might," "will," "expect," "anticipate," "plan," "believe," "potential," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from management's current expectations. For example, there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required, and that such amounts may be material, or that additional capital, if required, will be available on reasonable terms, if at all, at such times and in such amounts as may be needed by us. In addition to these factors, among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, are uncertainties relating to the integration of acquired businesses; general economic conditions affecting our business segments; the continued impact of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic; the severe disruptions to the economy, the financial markets, and the markets in which we compete; dependence of certain of our businesses on certain key customers; and the risk that we will not realize all of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or other efforts to optimize our asset base, as well as competitive factors relating to the aerospace industry. For a more detailed discussion of these and other factors affecting us, see the risk factors described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors." A prolonged impact of COVID-19 could also have the effect of heightening many of these risks.

 Proprietary Rights
 We benefit from our proprietary rights relating to designs, engineering and manufacturing processes, and repair and overhaul procedures. For some products, our unique manufacturing capabilities are required by the customer's specifications or designs, thereby necessitating reliance on us for the production of such specially designed products.
 We view our name and trademark as significant to our business as a whole. Our products are protected by a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses, or other forms of intellectual property that expire at various dates in the future. We continually develop and acquire new intellectual property and consider all of our intellectual property to be valuable. However, based on the broad scope of our product lines, management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial position, or our business segments. Our policy is to file applications and obtain patents for our new products as appropriate, including product modifications and improvements. While patents generally expire 20 years after the patent application filing date, new patents are issued to us on a regular basis.
 In our overhaul and repair businesses, OEMs of equipment that we maintain for our customers often include language in repair manuals that relate to their equipment, asserting broad claims of proprietary rights to the contents of the manuals used in our operations. There can be no assurance that OEMs will not try to enforce such claims, including the possible use of legal proceedings. In the event of such legal proceedings, there can be no assurance that such actions against the Company will be unsuccessful. However, we believe that our use of manufacture and repair manuals is lawful.
 Sales, Marketing, and Engineering
 Each of our operating companies maintains responsibility for selling and marketing its specific products. These businesses are responsible for selling aerospace engineered products, integrated assemblies, cabin acoustic insulation and repair and overhaul services, reaching across our operating companies, to our OEM, military, airline, and air cargo customers. In certain limited cases, we use independent, commission-based representatives to serve our customers' changing needs in some of the markets and geographic regions in which we operate.
Triumph also maintains two account executives, for Boeing and Airbus, who coordinate corporate selling activities at these two key customers. Additionally, Triumph has established multiple Customer Focus Teams ("CFT") which are cross functional teams focused on Triumph’s activities, performance, and coordination with large customers.
Our account executives,, business development teams, and CFT’s operate as the front end of the selling process, establishing or maintaining relationships, identifying opportunities to leverage our brand, and providing service for our customers. We meet our customers’ needs by designing systems that integrate the capabilities of our companies.

A significant portion of our government and defense contracts are awarded on a competitive bidding basis. We generally do not bid or act as the primary contractor but will typically bid and act as a subcontractor on contracts on a fixed-price basis. We generally sell to our other customers on a fixed price, negotiated contract, or purchase order basis.
 When subcontracting, there is a risk of nonperformance by our subcontractors, which could lead to disputes regarding quality, cost or impacts to production schedules. Additionally, economic environment changes or natural disasters, trade sanctions, tariffs, budgetary constraints, earthquakes, fires, extreme weather conditions, or pandemics, affecting the prime contractor and our subcontractors may adversely affect their ability to meet or support our performance requirements.
 Backlog
 We have a number of long-term agreements with several of our customers. These agreements generally describe the terms under which the customer may issue purchase orders to buy our products and services during the term of the agreement. These terms typically include a list of the products or repair services customers may purchase, initial pricing, anticipated quantities and, to the extent known, delivery dates. In tracking and reporting our backlog, however, we only include amounts for which we have actual purchase orders with firm delivery dates or contract requirements generally within the next 24 months, which primarily relate to sales to our OEM customer base. Purchase orders issued by our aftermarket customers are usually completed within a short period of time. As a result, our backlog data relates primarily to the OEM customers. The backlog information set forth below does not include the sales that we expect to generate from long-term agreements for which we do not have actual purchase orders with firm delivery dates. Additionally, the backlog as of March 31, 2022, does not include outstanding purchase orders associated with the Aerospace Structures manufacturing operations located in Stuart, Florida, which are held for sale on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022, and the sale of which is expected to be completed in the first half of calendar 2022.
As of March 31, 2022, we had outstanding purchase orders representing an aggregate invoice price of approximately $1.42 billion, of which $1.17 billion and $0.25 billion related to Systems & Support and Aerospace Structures, respectively. As of March 31, 2021, our continuing operations had outstanding purchase orders representing an aggregate invoice price of approximately $1.87 billion, of which $1.18 billion and $0.68 billion related to Systems & Support and Aerospace Structures, respectively. Of the existing backlog of $1.42 billion, we estimate approximately $0.85 billion will be shipped by March 31, 2023. Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information on our backlog.
Dependence on Significant Customers
 As disclosed in Note 19, a significant portion of our net sales are to the Boeing Company (“Boeing”). Refer to Note 19 for specific disclosure of the concentration of net sales and accounts receivable to these customers. A significant reduction in sales to Boeing may have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
 Competition
 We compete primarily with Tier 1 and Tier 2 systems suppliers and component manufacturers, some of which are divisions or subsidiaries of other large companies, in the manufacture of aircraft structures, systems components, subassemblies, and detail parts.
 Competition for the repair and overhaul of aviation components comes from four primary sources, some of whom possess greater financial and other resources than we have and, as a result, may be in a better position to handle the current environment: OEMs, major commercial airlines, government support depots, and other independent repair and overhaul companies. Some major commercial airlines continue to own and operate their own service centers, while others have begun to sell or outsource their repair and overhaul services to other aircraft operators or third parties. Large domestic and foreign airlines that provide repair and overhaul services typically provide these services not only for their own aircraft but for other airlines as well. OEMs also maintain service centers that provide repair and overhaul services for the components they manufacture. Many governments maintain aircraft support depots in their military organizations that maintain and repair the aircraft they operate. Other independent service organizations also compete for the repair and overhaul business of other users of aircraft components.
 Participants in the aerospace industry compete primarily on the basis of breadth of technical capabilities, quality, turnaround time, capacity, and price.
 Government Regulation, Including Environmental Regulations and Industry Oversight
 Government Regulation and Industry Oversight

The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States by the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") and in other countries by similar agencies. We must be certified by the FAA and, in some cases, by individual OEMs, in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended, our operations would be adversely affected. New and more stringent government regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened, in the future, and these new regulations, if enacted, or any industry oversight, if heightened, may have an adverse impact on us.
 We must also satisfy the requirements of our customers, including OEMs, that are subject to FAA regulations, and provide these customers with products and repair services that comply with the government regulations applicable to aircraft components used in commercial flight operations. The FAA regulates commercial flight operations and requires that aircraft components meet its stringent standards. In addition, the FAA requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components, and we currently satisfy these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services. Several of our operating locations are FAA-certificated repair stations.
 Generally, the FAA only grants approvals for the manufacture or repair of a specific aircraft component, rather than the broader approvals that have been granted in the past. The FAA approval process may be costly and time-consuming. In order to obtain an FAA Air Agency Certificate, an applicant must satisfy all applicable regulations of the FAA governing repair stations. These regulations require that an applicant have experienced personnel, inspection systems, suitable facilities, and equipment. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate a need for the certificate. An applicant must procure manufacturer’s repair manuals from design approval holders relating to each particular aircraft component. Because of these regulatory requirements, the application process may involve substantial cost.
 The certification processes for the European Aviation Safety Agency ("EASA"), which regulates this industry in the European Union; the Civil Aviation Administration of China; and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, are similarly stringent, involving potentially lengthy audits. EASA was formed in 2002 and is handling most of the responsibilities of the national aviation authorities in Europe, such as the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority.
 Our operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws. For example, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 ("OSHA") mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees in the United States. In addition, OSHA provides special procedures and measures for the handling of hazardous and toxic substances. Specific safety standards have been promulgated for workplaces engaged in the treatment, disposal, or storage of hazardous waste. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with OSHA's health and safety requirements.
 Environmental Regulation
 Our business, operations, and facilities are subject to numerous stringent federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations by government agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"). Among other matters, these regulatory authorities impose requirements that regulate the emission, discharge, generation, management, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, pollutants, and contaminants; govern public and private response actions to hazardous or regulated substances which may be or have been released to the environment; and require us to obtain and maintain licenses and permits in connection with our operations. This extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on us. Although management believes that our operations and our facilities are in material compliance with such laws and regulations, future changes in these laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof or the nature of our operations or regulatory enforcement actions which may arise may require us to make significant additional capital expenditures to ensure ongoing compliance or engage in remedial actions.
 Certain of our facilities, including facilities acquired and operated by us or one of our subsidiaries, have at one time or another been under active investigation for environmental contamination by federal or state agencies when acquired, and at least in some cases, continue to be under investigation or subject to remediation. We are frequently indemnified by prior owners or operators and/or present owners of the facilities for liabilities that we incur as a result of these investigations and the environmental contamination found that predates our acquisition of these facilities, subject to certain limitations. We also maintain a pollution liability policy that provides coverage for certain material liabilities associated with the cleanup of on-site pollution conditions, as well as defense and indemnity for certain third-party suits (including Superfund liabilities at third-party sites), in each case, to the extent not otherwise indemnified. This policy applies to all of our manufacturing and assembly operations worldwide. Also, as we proceed with our plans to exit certain facilities as part of restructuring and related initiatives, the need for remediation for potential environmental contamination could be identified, and such obligations could be material. If we are required to pay the expenses related to environmental liabilities because neither indemnification nor insurance coverage is available, these expenses could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Human Capital Resources
 Our success greatly depends on identifying, attracting, engaging, developing, and retaining a highly skilled workforce in multiple areas, including engineering, manufacturing, information technology, cybersecurity, business development, finance, and strategy and management. Our human capital management strategy places significant importance on attracting and developing a talented and diverse workforce by creating a workplace that is engaging and inclusive and promotes a culture of innovation, excellence,
and continuous improvement. The objectives of our human capital management strategy are aligned with and support our strategic and financial goals.
We use a wide variety of human capital measures in managing our business, including workforce demographics and diversity metrics; talent acquisition, retention, and development metrics; and employee safety and health metrics.
Diversity and Workforce Demographics
 We value the diversity of our workforce and believe that the best innovation and business results are achieved when teams are populated with individuals from a diverse set of backgrounds, cultures, genders, and experiences. We have a Diversity & Inclusion Steering Committee (“DISC”) committed to creating an environment in which all employees feel valued, included, and empowered to share their unique experiences, perspectives, and viewpoints. We believe this is critical to the success of our business and the delivery of world class manufacturing, engineering, and aerospace services. We track the diversity of our leadership and workforce and review our progress toward our diversity objectives with the Company’s Board of Directors on a periodic basis. Across our total employee population and based on employees who self-identify, as of March 31, 2022, approximately 30% of our global workforce are female. Of our employees based in the United States, who have self-identified, approximately 20% are multicultural and 7% are veterans.
Several of our subsidiaries are parties to collective bargaining agreements with labor unions. Under those agreements, we currently employ approximately 701 full-time employees. Currently, approximately 13% of our 5,340 permanent employees are represented by labor unions and approximately 25% of net sales are derived from the facilities at which at least some employees are unionized. Of the 701 employees represented by unions, no employees are working under contracts that have expired.
 Our inability to negotiate an acceptable contract with any of our labor unions could result in strikes by the affected workers and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. If the unionized workers were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or if other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and higher ongoing labor costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 Talent Acquisition, Retention, and Development
 Hiring, developing, and retaining talented employees, particularly in highly technical areas, is an integral part of our human capital management. In addition to our focus on recruitment, we monitor attrition rates, including with respect to top talent. We believe that the commitment and connection of employees to their workplace, what we refer to as employee engagement, is a critical component of retention of top talent. We periodically conduct surveys of our workforce designed to gauge “employee engagement”. Our People & Culture Committee monitors the responses to these surveys in our pursuit of continuously improving our employee engagement metrics. We also continue to invest in technology that supports the effectiveness, efficiency, and engagement of our employees, including advanced communication systems and processes. These investments were particularly valuable as we navigated the challenges presented by the global COVID-19 pandemic.
We also attract and reward our employees by providing market-competitive compensation and benefit practices that cover the many facets of health, including resources and programs designed to support physical, mental, and financial wellness. We also provide tuition reimbursement and other educational and training opportunities to our employees.
Employee Safety and Health
 Ensuring the safety of our employees is a top priority for us. Our safety and health program seeks to enhance business value by creating a safe and healthy work environment, promote the resiliency of our workforce and engage our employees. We provide health and safety guidance and resources to all of our businesses in order to ensure occupational safety, reduce risk, and prevent incidents. Our values include the commitment of each person to creating a safe work environment for themselves and their team members, and, through various programs and activities, we recognize individuals in our organization who make significant contributions to workplace safety.
We monitor the effectiveness of our safety and health program by comparing recordable incidents and incident severity to specific performance metrics established annually. We measure the volume of safety incidents through the total recordable incident rate (“TRIR”) metric, and we measure incident severity through the days away restricted and transferred (“DART”) metric across all of our facilities. These rates are measured on a calendar year basis, and the table below reflects our results over the three most recent calendar years:

 | Calendar year ended | 
Safety Metric | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
TRIR | | 1.8 | | 1.9 | | 2.3
DART | | 1.0 | | 1.3 | | 1.4
TRIR = total number of recordable cases x 200,000 / total hours worked 
DART = number of cases with days away from work x 200,000 / total hours worked by all employees

 In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we established a cross-functional team to develop appropriate workplace safety and health policies. We implemented strict protocols aimed at protecting our people and keeping our factories operational and followed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) guidance. Drawing upon our core value of acting with velocity, Triumph team members responded locally and on a company-wide basis with innovative solutions to limit the spread of the virus
and deliver products and services to customers. This included equipping employees with personal protective equipment; sanitizing workspaces more frequently; and investing in technologies, including enhanced rapid communication software and other technologies that enabled many employees to work remotely. We limited travel and adjusted our capacity and staffing levels in response to commercial demands. The Company also produced and distributed over 10,000 masks to local medical facilities. Our COVID-19 response team continues to monitor the impact of the pandemic and will continue to provide guidance to our businesses and employees with regard to appropriate safety measures and policies.
Community Service and Philanthropy
 Since 2011, we have demonstrated a deep dedication to corporate citizenship through our Wings community outreach program. Through Wings, based on the needs of their communities, our employees around the world create and implement service projects by partnering with local nonprofit organizations and engage in meaningful volunteer projects that directly benefit local charities committed to serving the needs of others. In 2018, to commemorate our 25th anniversary, the Company committed to 25,000 hours of volunteerism. Through the Wings program and individual acts of volunteerism, employees at our sites have partnered with organizations, including The United Way, The American Red Cross, The Salvation Army, Boys and Girls Club of Middle Tennessee, Ouachita Children’s Center, Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, Second Harvest Food Bank, and many others. The Company enjoys partnering in local communities, and team-based volunteer events help bring our employees together as one team serving its communities.
In 2008, the Triumph Group Charitable Foundation was formed and funded. The Triumph Group Charitable Foundation allocates its approximately $300 thousand annual grant budget to recipient organizations with the missions of advancing education, particularly in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (“STEM”), improving our communities, and supporting veterans and military families.
