Business Overview

Leafbuyer.com Platform

Our wholly owned subsidiary, LB Media Group, LLC has evolved and grown as a listing website to a comprehensive marketing technology platform that focuses on new customer acquisition and retention tools that include texting and loyalty and application software technology. With the increased popularity of Leafbuyer texting/loyalty program, clients can communicate through SMS, MMS as well as push notifications within a custom branded application. The platform gives dispensary owners the ability to target market their customer base by spending limits, brands, frequency and product types. The Leafbuyer platform alerts consumers of specials as well as confirmation about online ordering, helping to create a more diverse product offering for our clients. Leafbuyer’s proprietary systems are integrated to form a seamless process for the user to locate, research, and compare prices on thousands of available products. Our website, Leafbuyer.com, and its progressive web application hosts a robust search algorithm similar to popular travel or hotel sites, where consumers can search the database for appealing offers. Consumers can also search through thousands of menu items and products, create a profile, sign up to receive deal alerts and place online orders for pick up or delivery. With a worldwide pandemic due to Covid-19, the need for an order ahead solution in the cannabis industry was put to the test in early March of 2020. We believe we answered that test with technology enhancements we made that now include delivery features for medical and recreational stores, increased POS integrations and real-time notifications through SMS/MMS and push notification technology.

The Leafbuyer Technology Platform reaches millions of cannabis consumers every month through its web-based platform, loyalty platform and smart application technology. Our website’s sophisticated vendor dashboard allows vendors to update menus, deals and create real-time messages to communicate to consumers 24/7. The platform also provides a robust reporting feature to track the vendors’ return on investment.

We continue an aggressive push into all legal cannabis states. Increasing our marketing and sales presence in new markets is a primary objective. Along with this expansion, we continue to develop new technologies that will serve cannabis dispensaries and product companies in attracting and retaining consumers.

Leafbuyer operates in a rapidly evolving and highly regulated industry that, as has been estimated by grandviewresearch.com, to exceed $70 billion in revenue by the year 2028. The founders and our Board of Directors have been, and will continue to be, aggressive in pursuing long-term opportunities.

In November of 2020 Leafbuyer Technologies Inc. completed a customizable white label application for our dispensary clients. Consumers have the ability to search, shop, earn rewards, place orders and communicate with their favorite stores all in one convenient application. The application can also be completely branded for the dispensary and allows for 24/7 communication with their patrons. 

In April of 2022 Leafbuyer Technologies Inc. launched our data segmentation feature that allows dispensaries to target market their customers. Clients can direct messaging based on spending limits, product types, shopping frequency just to name a few and target market their customer base.  Through our advanced integrations, this feature helps increase ROI for the dispensaries and generates more revenue for Leafbuyer.  We will continue to expand this feature in the coming months to include more data points based on our customer’s needs.                   

COVID -19 and Reduction of Costs 

We were affected in 2020 by the COVID-19 outbreak and worldwide pandemic. We saw some postponements in orders in the first few weeks of March 2020 but by the end of March 2020 orders stabilized to a normal level. Many companies in 2020 including Leafbuyer were forced to operate remotely for most of the year which ultimately led to some cost saving benefits. With the effectiveness of a remote sales and development teams, we made the decision to reduce office space in California and Colorado which has significantly reduced costs on an annual basis. We then also made a significant pivot to enhance and automate our technology in 2020 in order to further reduce costs but also provide more tools to increase consumer engagement. 

Cost Control 

One of our top priorities in 2022 has been reducing costs by building better more efficient technology, while converting some positions to part time and focusing on high margin products that help retain current customers.  In 2022 we achieved cash flow positive as a result of these measures.   
The Team

We have 15 full-time employees and our headquarters are located in Greenwood Village, Colorado. In addition, we currently have sales teams in California and Oklahoma. Leafbuyer also has relationships with numerous contractors which it retains from time to time. A majority of our employees are involved in sales and customer service.

Growth State by State

As new states continue to legalize marijuana sales and the market expands, so does Leafbuyer. As of June 2022, Leafbuyer now works with clients in 24 legal states including California, Colorado, Washington, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Michigan and we are continuing our efforts to expand into all legal markets. Our primary focus are markets that have the most potential and that are continuing to expand and show stability.

The marginal cost for Leafbuyer to enter a market is minimal in comparison to growers or retail operations. In order for us to enter a new market, most of our costs include sales and marketing personnel and grassroots efforts to grow the consumer base in the new market. With the changing times of Covid-19, virtual meetings have doubled and are more accepted reducing the cost of travel and office space into smaller markets.

We have formed numerous partnerships in the industry with Point-of-Sale (“POS”) companies. We have solid integrations with 90% of the top POS companies and are continuing to work to deepen those capabilities as they are built.

2022 and Beyond

With the global legal marijuana market size expanding the legal use of marijuana for medicinal and recreational purposes is expected to continue.

Our business model is designed to benefit from this trend. When a new state passes a medical or recreational cannabis law, we can start marketing to consumers and businesses in that state with minimal marginal cost. Because Leafbuyer is not involved in the production or sale of cannabis, we do not have to build expensive growing operations or open brick and mortar stores. As more states pass laws to offer legal cannabis products, we begin marketing into the state and sign-up dispensaries to be on the Leafbuyer platform.

We are accelerating growth with our platform by offering custom branded applications. This product works in conjunction with our texting and loyalty platform to provide a truly unique value proposition. Text marketing is monetized through a monthly usage fee while the Custom Application is monetized as a monthly subscription fee.  We anticipate a significant reduction in provider costs over time as each application sold allows for push notifications which reduces our overall cost to send via SMS or MMS.  

We will also continue to grow organically through the aggressive deployment of sales and marketing resources into legal cannabis states. We understand that to obtain a significant market share in the industry in the future it will require us to look for acquisitions for a significant portion of that growth. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and acquire such opportunities or that they will be on terms that are favorable to us.
