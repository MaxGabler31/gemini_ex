ITEM 1.    Business
Overview
Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, primarily operates, franchises, and develops casual dining restaurants in North America famous for serving more than two dozen craveable, high-quality burgers with Bottomless Steak Fries® in a fun environment welcoming to Guests of all ages. 
We opened the first Red Robin® restaurant in Seattle, Washington in September 1969. In 1979, the first franchised Red Robin restaurant was opened in Yakima, Washington. In 2001, we formed Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and consummated a reorganization of the Company. Since that time, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. has owned, either directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding capital stock or membership interests, respectively, of Red Robin International, Inc. and our other operating subsidiaries through which we operate our Company-owned restaurants. Unless otherwise provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, references to "Red Robin," "we," "us," "our", or the "Company" refer to Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries.
As of the end of our fiscal year on December 26, 2021, there were 531 Red Robin restaurants, of which 430 were Company-owned and 101 were operated by franchisees. Our franchisees are independent organizations to whom we provide certain support. See "Restaurant Franchise and Licensing Arrangements" for additional information about our franchise program. As of December 26, 2021, there were Red Robin restaurants in 44 states and one Canadian province.
The Company operates its business as one operating and one reportable segment. Financial information for our operating segment is included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company's fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the last Sunday of the calendar year. We refer to our fiscal years as 2021, 2020, and 2019 throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our fiscal years, fiscal year end dates, and the number of weeks in each period are summarized in the table below:

Business Strategy
Our long-term business strategy was developed using Guest and Team Member insights to align our efforts with our unique brand position in the industry. Our Guests are every-day people seeking connection with friends and family across a diverse, and multi-generational demographic with a large majority falling into the Gen X, Millennial, and Centennial generations. We believe our broad demographic appeal and distinct Red Robin brand equities position us well for future growth.
While the COVID-19 pandemic brought forth complex challenges, it also enabled us to intensely focus on improving our operating and financial model. The material improvements made to our business will enable us to execute our business strategy in an even stronger position. Our business strategy focuses on the following pillars;
•People: Be the Employer of Choice in the Industry. We champion a culture of diversity and inclusion where our people are developed, recognized and celebrated – and can always “come as they are.” We empower the people who make Red Robin possible and offer a compelling Team Member value proposition.
•Food: Deliver a Variety of Gourmet Burgers and Mainstream Favorites that Guests Love. We offer a wide variety of gourmet burgers, with a creative take on traditional. We understand our Guests’ preferences and provide high-quality burgers with sustainable alternatives, including the ImpossibleTM burger and our Veggie burger. We also 
offer other mainstream favorites, like shareable pizza, wings, milkshakes, and beer. We continue to focus on meaningful menu innovation that is compelling to Guests and easy for our Operations teams to execute.
•Guest Experience: Create Relevant, Personalized and Memorable Guest Experiences. We leverage our Total Guest Experience ("TGX") hospitality model to deliver fun and playful service that is tailored and customized to our Guests’ time and occasion, while delivering exceptional value through our commitment to bottomless steak fries® and drinks. We employ both off-premises and restaurant technology enhancements to present our Guest with a seamless and frictionless experience.
•Foundation: Execute Profitable Growth Platforms. Essential to our business model and related capital allocation, we have developed several platforms designed to drive consistent and profitable growth. We are continuing to invest in these platforms that include our digital ecosystem and Donatos®, and support growing multiple channels of business including dine-in, off-premises and catering. We are also in the early stages of reestablishing our new restaurant development program.
The Red Robin vision is to be the restaurant brand that our communities trust most…YUMMM®!
Restaurant Concept
The Red Robin brand has many desirable attributes, including a range of high-quality menu items, a strong Guest-focused culture, and a strong value proposition, where our Guests experience memorable moments of connection with family, friends, and fun.
We pride ourselves on our Gourmet Burgers and other mainstream favorites served in a casual, playful atmosphere. Our menu features our signature product, a line of Gourmet Burgers made from premium quality, fresh ground beef. To complement our best-selling Gourmet Burgers, we offer an everyday-value line of Red's Tavern Double® burgers, and Red Robin's Finest line made with premium toppings. We also offer burgers made with other proteins including chicken breasts (grilled or fried), turkey patties, as well as a proprietary vegetarian patty and the Impossible™ plant-based burger patty. We offer a selection of buns, including gluten free, sesame, brioche, and lettuce wraps, with a variety of toppings, including house-made sauces, crispy onion straws, sautéed mushrooms, several cheese choices, and a fried egg. All of our burgers are served with our all-you-can-eat Bottomless Steak Fries® or Guests may choose from other side options. We specialize in customizing our menu items to meet our Guests' dietary needs and preferences and have received recognition from experts in the allergen community. In addition to burgers, which accounted for 58% of food sales in 2021, Red Robin serves an array of other mainstream favorites that appeal to our Guests. These items include a variety of shareable foods like Donatos® pizza, wings, salads, other entrees, and desserts. We also offer a range of single-serve and shareable desserts as well as our milkshakes. Our beverages include signature alcoholic and non-alcoholic specialty drinks, cocktails, wine, and a variety of national and craft beers.
We strive to give our Guests the choice of the pace of their experience based on their occasion, from accommodating time-pressured meals to offering a place to relax and connect with family and friends. Red Robin also has an extraordinary approach to Guest service, and we have cataloged thousands of stories of Red Robin Team Members who live our values. Many examples can be found on our website, www.redrobin.com. Note that our website and the information contained on or connected to our website are not incorporated by reference herein, and our web address is included as an inactive textual reference only.
We also strive to provide our Guests with exceptional dining value and the ability to customize their experience. In 2021, we had an average check per Guest of $14.46 including beverages. Average Guest check increased compared to 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic restricted indoor dining resulting in a higher off-premise sales mix. We believe our price-to-value relationship, featuring our innovative array of quality burgers, served with bottomless fries, differentiates us from our casual dining competitors and allows us to appeal to a broad base of middle income, multi-generational consumers.
Ongoing Commitment to Sustainability
Red Robin's Better for Being Here mentality represents our commitment as the Company matures its approach to sustainability. Red Robin is a company that cares; we have always strived to make the world a better place for our Team Members, our community, and our planet. We are beginning to undertake a more formal and robust sustainability journey with meaningful goals and a commitment to align with the industry, and are informed by experts including the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (the "SASB").
Human Capital Management
We strive to ensure our employees, whom we refer to as Team Members, are Better for Being Here through our core B.U.R.G.E.R values: Bottomless Fun, Unwavering Integrity, Relentless Focus on Improvement, Genuine Spirit of Service, Extraordinary People, and Recognized Burger Authority. Each of these values work to empower and develop our Team 
Members and has created a Company culture that we collectively take pride in every day. We reward and incentivize our Team Members with competitive pay, recognition and rewards, and benefit programs. We also provide our Team Members the opportunity to grow and develop, promote health and safety, and value inclusion, diversity, and engagement.
As part of our human capital management strategy, we focus on the following areas:
Our Team Members
As of December 26, 2021, we had 22,483 Team Members consisting of 22,045 Team Members at Company-owned restaurants and 438 restaurant support center and field-based Team Members. We focus on General Manager tenure in restaurants and its positive link to Guest traffic, overall Guest satisfaction, and Team Member turnover trends. Our General Manager turnover during 2021 was 27.6%, and 67.2% of General Managers have been managing their current restaurant for a year or more. None of our Team Members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Competitive Compensation and Benefits
We support our Team Members by offering market-competitive wages and benefits for eligible Team Members. We pay competitive, prevailing wages, and our only positions paid below minimum wage at the restaurant level are our tipped Team Members who are paid at the state tip credit rate or state minimum wage rate. All other positions are paid at or above minimum wage, and we ensure tipped positions make more than minimum wage when including tips. Our benefits programs include medical and other insurance, employee assistance programs, shift meals, Red Robin meal discounts, paid time off, 401(k) with employer match, an employee stock purchase plan, and equity-based awards for eligible restaurant support center and operations Team Members, generally, at the director level and above.
Our compensation and performance evaluation systems are carefully designed to maintain pay equity by focusing pay decisions on experience and performance to ensure the Company retains a highly productive workforce to operate our business while providing a high level of service to our Guests.
Health and Safety
We operate with the health, safety, and well-being of Red Robin's Team Members, Guests, and communities in mind, as well as federal, state and local regulatory requirements. We have traditionally been a leader in health and safety and have implemented new practices during the COVID-19 pandemic consistent with that leadership position.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have provided personal protective equipment for our restaurant Team Members. We also provided COVID-19 testing coverage for our restaurant Team Members through our benefit plans before it was required.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we immediately instituted telecommuting policies at the restaurant support center to support working from home. As a result of the success of that approach, we have implemented a dispersed workforce policy that permits many of our Restaurant Support Center Team Members to continue working remotely and we expect that to continue on a go-forward basis. For on-site critical, Company leadership, and those who desire to work in a shared location, we have optimized our office footprint to meet the needs of that population.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
At Red Robin, we value diversity and inclusion. We have a successful Women's Excellence program, a Company-wide resource group to support and inspire Team Members through development, networking, leadership, and other resources while fueling a culture of opportunity and diversity, and we continue to partner with the Women's Foodservice Forum, which has been instrumental in providing valuable resources and insights to help the advancement of our female leaders. 
We are progressing with an initiative with the assistance of a diversity consultant to identify areas of opportunity for expanded diversity and inclusion practices in our Company and to support the development and execution of a comprehensive long-term diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy for Red Robin. In late 2021, Directors and above in Operations and Restaurant Support Center leadership positions completed unconscious bias training. We intend to provide similar training to our restaurant General Managers in 2022.
Restaurant Management
Our typical restaurant management team consists of a general manager, an assistant general manager, one to two associate managers, and additional shift supervisors depending on restaurant sales volumes. With our restaurant management restructuring completed in 2020, we have been able to fluctuate supervision needs more easily to better adjust to sales volumes in our restaurants. This improves our ability to manage effectively by placing more management and supervision in the restaurants during peak times. In 2021, we accelerated hiring of associate managers to reflect improving sales volumes, and to support operationally challenged restaurants. Our restaurant management restructuring also expanded our talent pipeline with additional capacity for entry-level restaurant managers. This provides a structured and clear career path for our Team Members and allows us to broaden our external candidate pool beyond individuals with full service dining experience. 
The management team of each restaurant is responsible for the day-to-day operation of that restaurant, including hiring, training, and coaching of Team Members, as well as operating results. Our typical restaurant employs approximately 47 Team Members, most of whom work part-time on an hourly basis.
Learning and Development
We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants through the training and development of Team Members and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to Team Member performance, Guest satisfaction, food and beverage preparation, and the maintenance of our restaurants. Each restaurant maintains a group of certified learning coaches, including a head learning coach, who collectively are tasked with preparing new Team Members for success by providing on-the-job training leading up to a final skills certification for their position. Team Members seeking advancement have the opportunity to join our management development program as a Shift Supervisor. We continue to focus on hiring, training, and retaining our Team Members as we believe this is key to maintaining quality and consistency in each of our restaurants.
New restaurant managers participate in our eight-week Management Foundations training program. This program hones each manager's skills, specifically in two areas: flawless shift execution and effective coaching of Team Members.
These learning and development practices at the restaurants support our talent pipeline to develop and promote our restaurant management Team Members from within.
Team Member Engagement
We regularly collect feedback to better understand and improve Team Member experience and identify opportunities to strengthen our culture. We welcome open, candid feedback to ensure Team Members feel heard and engaged and to better support the values important to each of our Team Members. We accomplish this through a variety of programs and forums, including town halls, virtual open forums, and one-on-one coaching, wellness and engagement meetings, and Team Member Voice surveys. In addition to these structured programs and forums, we maintain an open-door policy at all levels of the Company. Our Company remains committed to offering Team Members numerous opportunities to have their voices heard because we believe our Team Members are our most valuable resource.
In late 2021, we began exploring the need to update and enhance our Team Member value proposition. This includes a multi-channel discovery process where we have sought feedback from prior Team Members as well as current Team Members in our restaurants and the Restaurant Support Center. Conducted through a variety of survey and interview techniques, we have developed a growing body of data to inform the evolution of our Team Member value proposition.
Food Safety and Purchasing
Our food safety and quality assurance programs help manage our commitment to quality ingredients and food preparation. Our systems are designed to protect our food supply from product receipt through preparation and service. We provide detailed specifications for our proprietary food ingredients, products, and supplies to our suppliers. We qualify and audit on an annual basis all of our food and beverage suppliers, as well as growers. Their certifications must comply with the Global Food Safety Initiative, if applicable. Our restaurant managers are certified in a comprehensive safety and sanitation course by the National Restaurant Association's ServSafe program. Strict food safety protocols, including safe cooking temperature requirements, food handling procedures, cooling procedures, and frequent temperature and quality checks, ensure the safety and quality of the food we serve in our restaurants. In order to provide the freshest ingredients and products and to maximize operating efficiencies between purchase and usage, each restaurant's management team determines the restaurant's daily usage requirements for food ingredients, products, and supplies, and accordingly, orders from approved suppliers, and distributors. The restaurant management team inspects deliveries to ensure that the products received meet our safety and quality specifications. Additionally, we engage an independent auditing company to perform unannounced comprehensive food safety and sanitation inspections up to four times a year in all Company-owned and franchised restaurants.
To maximize our purchasing efficiencies and obtain the best possible prices for our high-quality ingredients, products, and supplies, our centralized purchasing team negotiates supply agreements that may include fixed price contracts that can vary in term or formula-based pricing agreements that can fluctuate on changes in raw material commodity pricing. Of our total cost of goods in 2021, ground beef represented approximately 16%, potatoes represented approximately 12%, and poultry represented approximately 11%. We monitor the market for the primary commodities we purchase and extend contract positions when applicable in order to minimize the impact of fluctuations in price and availability. However, certain commodities, primarily cheese, bacon and ground beef, have historically been subject to market price fluctuations. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience distribution disruptions, commodity cost inflation, and certain food and supply shortages. To manage this risk in part, we enter into fixed-price purchase commitments for certain commodities; however, it may not be possible for us to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments for certain commodities, or we may choose not to enter into fixed-price contracts for certain commodities. We believe that substantially all of our food and supplies meeting our specifications are available from alternate sources, which we have identified to diversify our supply chain. 
As of December 26, 2021, approximately 65% of our estimated annual food and beverage purchases were covered by fixed price contracts, most of which are scheduled to expire at various times through the end of 2022.
Restaurant Development, Remodels, and Donatos® 
In 2020, Red Robin reestablished a new restaurant development program as part of its long-term growth strategy which includes opportunities to execute sustainable growth initiatives that deliver value to our stockholders. We have made considerable progress establishing the foundation of our program during the pandemic, including refining our new restaurant prototype design, identifying target markets to prudently add new restaurants and reengaging our broker network to assist in identifying new restaurant sites. Target markets were selected based on brand affinity, operational and financial performance, marketing efficiency, availability of incremental sites, and expected financial returns. Specific site selection criteria is focused on identifying markets, trade areas, and specific sites that are likely to yield the greatest density of desirable demographic characteristics, retail traffic, and visibility.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we opened one corporate restaurant in a high volume market. This restaurant utilizes our new prototype configuration with design enhancements to improve dine in, off-premises, and curbside execution, and an optimized kitchen layout that enhances efficiency. The Company is expecting to pursue modest new restaurant growth based on an ongoing track record of successful restaurant openings that meet our financial criteria, beginning in 2023.
During the pandemic, we suspended restaurant refreshes and remodels at our existing locations. Starting in 2022, we are resuming this program to keep our restaurants relevant and well-maintained. 
In 2020, we announced our partnership with Donatos®, a high-quality pizza brand "nested" inside of Red Robin restaurants. Through this partnership, our restaurants will prepare and serve Donatos® branded pizzas to our dine in and off-premises Guests. Pursuant to a licensing arrangement, we will pay royalties on sales of Donatos® pizza products to Donatos®. As of December 26, 2021, we have introduced Donatos® pizzas to 198 restaurants. We plan to introduce Donatos® to approximately 50 restaurants in 2022 and expect to complete our rollout to approximately 400 Company-owned restaurants during 2023.
Restaurant Franchise and Licensing Arrangements
As of December 26, 2021, our franchisees operated 101 restaurants in 16 states and British Columbia, Canada. Our two largest franchisees own 43 restaurants located in Eastern and Central Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio. We anticipate that our franchisees will open one new restaurant in 2022. 
Franchise Compliance Assurance
We actively work with and monitor our franchisees' performance to help them develop and operate their restaurants in compliance with Red Robin's standards, systems, and procedures. During the restaurant development phase, we review the franchisee's site selection and provide the franchisee with our prototype building plans. We provide trainers to assist the franchisee in opening the restaurant for business. We advise the franchisee on all menu items, management training, and equipment and food purchases. We also exchange best operating practices with our franchisees as we strive to improve our operating systems while attaining a high level of franchisee participation. 
Digital Ecosystem
During 2021, the Company has significantly advanced its digital strategy by completing a number of enhancements which together create an integrated and seamless digital ecosystem for our Guests.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we launched mobile applications on both iOS and Android platforms. These applications are designed to generate higher order conversion compared to the legacy online experience, and offer superior suggested upsell capabilities on top of a more convenient user experience.
During the fourth quarter of 2021, we also introduced improved and more relevant digital experiences to drive incremental frequency from existing Guests, new Guest traffic and Guest checks. These improvements include the launch of a new and improved website, and the integration of a new loyalty platform, giving us new segmentation capabilities to connect with our Guests more meaningfully, through personalized messaging based on their purchase history. This has allowed us to maintain high levels of engagement with the over 10 million members of our Red Robin Royalty program.
These enhancements of our digital Guest experiences were "soft-launched" in the fourth quarter of 2021, and will receive marketing support in early 2022 to drive awareness and trials of the new applications and website ordering experience. These enhancements are iterative, and we expect to continue making ongoing innovations and improvements to Red Robin's digital ecosystem following the initial launch for years to come.
Information Technology
We rely on information systems in all aspects of our operations, including, but not limited to, point-of-sale transaction processing in our restaurants, digital experiences, operation of our restaurants, labor management, management of our inventories, collection of cash, payment of payroll and other obligations, and various other processes and procedures.
Our restaurant support center and Company-owned restaurants are enabled with information technology and decision support systems. In our restaurants, these systems are designed to provide operational tools for sales, inventory, and labor management. This technology includes industry-specific, off-the-shelf systems such as tools designed to optimize food, beverage, and labor costs. These systems are integrated with our point-of-sale systems to provide daily, weekly, and period-to-date reporting that is important for Managers to run an efficient and high-performing restaurant. We also use technology to interact with our Guests via our digital ecosystem, inclusive of our website, mobile Apps, loyalty platform, online ordering site, and Guest feedback systems, which provide actionable insights on Guest service, food quality, and atmosphere of each restaurant.
We utilize centralized financial, accounting, and human resource management systems to support our restaurant support center and Company-owned restaurants. In addition, we use an operations scorecard that integrates data from our centralized systems and distributes information to assist in managing our restaurants. We believe these combined tools are important in analyzing and improving our operations, profit margins, and other results.
In 2020, we invested in infrastructure that modernized and upgraded the capacity of our restaurant systems, stabilized the hand-held point-of-sale devices system wide to prepare for the launch of our new Total Guest Experience service model, and continued work on new, Guest facing digital experiences that support in-restaurant and off-premise dining. In 2021, we implemented the first phase of our digital transformation which included a new and improved ordering site, custom mobile Apps (iOS and Android), and a new integrated Loyalty Platform. We plan to continue our investments in building innovative digital experiences for our Guests and to improve our ability to manage our technology infrastructure through investments in infrastructure, automation, and advanced monitoring through a Cloud first approach.
We accept electronic payment cards from our Guests for payment in our restaurants. We also receive and maintain certain personal information about our Guests and Team Members. We have systems and processes in place that focus on the protection of our Guests' credit card information and other private information we are required to protect, such as our Team Members' personal information. We have taken a number of steps to prevent the occurrence of security breaches in this respect. Our systems have been carefully designed and configured to protect against data loss or compromise. For example, because of the number of credit card transactions processed in our Company-owned restaurants, Red Robin is required to maintain compliance per the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) for our networks and systems both at our restaurant support center and Company-owned restaurants. Red Robin not only meets the requirements but also maintains a higher-level designation as a Merchant and Service Provider. These PCI compliance standards, set by a consortium of the major credit card companies, require annual assessment to ensure certain levels of system security and procedures are in place to protect our Guests' credit card and other personal information.
We also engage security assessors and consultants to review and advise us on our other data security practices with respect to protection of other sensitive personal information that we obtain from Guests and Team Members.
Marketing and Advertising
We build brand equity and awareness through a media strategy with tailored content by channel and target. We leverage digital media (including search, website, digital display, over-the-top, online video, and social media), email, SMS, and public relations initiatives. These programs are funded primarily through cooperative creative development and national media advertising funds. In addition, we supplement national media with targeted local media across offline and online channels.
In recent years, we have undertaken significant market research initiatives to gain a deep understanding of our Guests, our brand promise, and what we must do to deliver that promise. Additionally, we gain feedback and perceptions in order to inform our business decisions. Among other things, we use a Guest satisfaction tool in all restaurants that provides feedback from Guests on their experiences. Restaurant managers use this information to help identify areas of focus to strengthen restaurant performance and track progress. We also continually monitor our performance relative to peers and test potential business drivers among both current and potential Guests. We leverage our over ten million member Red Robin RoyaltyTM database to gain insights and track the frequency and purchase behavior of our Guests.
Our "All the Fulls" brand campaign, highlights our craveable food, distinctive positioning and emotional connection with Guests. We will also continue marketing support for our growing off-premise business which includes carryout, catering, and delivery. In 2021, we have maintained our focus on digital marketing, which has proven effective in reaching our core Guests where and how they consume media, in the most cost effective way. This digital marketing strategy has led to increased Guest engagement with our brand.

Competition
The restaurant industry is highly competitive, and our Guests may choose to purchase food at supermarkets or other food retailers. Although, for some occasions, we compete against other segments of the restaurant industry, including quick-service and fast-casual restaurants, our primary competition is with other sit-down, casual dining restaurants within the full service dining segment. In addition, we compete to attract Guests for off-premise dining occasions, including online ordering, delivery, to-go, and catering. The number, size, and strength of competitors vary by region, concept, market, and even restaurant. We compete on the basis of taste, quality, price of food and related Guest value, Guest service, ambiance, location, and overall dining experience.
We believe our Guest demographics, strong brand recognition, gourmet burger concept, family friendly atmosphere, attractive price-value relationship, and the quality of our food and service enable us to differentiate ourselves from our casual dining competitors. We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. Our competitors include well-established national chains which have more substantial marketing resources. We also compete with many other restaurant and retail establishments for Team Members.
Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the summer months and winter holiday season due to factors including our retail-oriented locations and family appeal. As a result, our quarterly operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality. Accordingly, results for any one quarter or year are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year, and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may vary.
Trademarks
We have a number of registered trademarks and service marks, including the Red Robin®, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers®, "YUMMM®", Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brews®, and Red Robin Royalty® and logos. We have registered for these marks, among others, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and we have applied to register various trademarks in certain other international jurisdictions. Pursuant to our licensing arrangement with Donatos®, we license the right to use the Donatos® trademark.
In order to better protect our brand, we have also registered the Internet domain name www.redrobin.com. We believe our trademarks, service marks, and other intellectual property rights have significant value and are important to our brand building efforts and the marketing of our restaurant concept.
Government Regulation
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal, state, and local governments have issued and revised a significant amount of regulations affecting our business, with requirements often changing without much advance notice. Regulations relating to the vaccination and COVID-19 testing of Guests and Team Members, Guest spacing within dining rooms and other social distancing practices, sanitation practices, isolation and quarantine periods for Team Members, paid sick leave, and mask mandates for Guests and Team Members have materially affected the way we operate our business and serve our Guests.
We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content, and menu labeling. Our collection or use of personal information about Guests or our Team Members is regulated at the federal and state levels, including the California Consumer Privacy Act.
Our restaurants are subject to various licensing requirements and other regulations by state, and local health, safety, fire, and other authorities, including licensing requirements, regulations for the sale of alcoholic beverages and food, and public health related indoor capacity restrictions. To date, we have been able to obtain and maintain all necessary licenses, permits, and approvals. The development and construction of new restaurants is also subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use, and environmental regulations. We are also subject to certain guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and various state codes and regulations, which require restaurants and our brand to provide full and equal access to persons with physical disabilities.
We are also subject to federal regulation and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises and substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. Various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our Team Members and can significantly impact our operating costs. These laws govern minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, tip credits, paid leave, meal and rest breaks, unemployment tax rates, health care and other benefits, workers' compensation rates, citizenship or residency requirements, child labor regulations, and discriminatory conduct.
