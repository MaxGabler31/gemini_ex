Item 1. Business 
Our Company 
 All references to “we”, “us”, “our”, “SBS”, “our company” or “the Company” in this Annual Report mean Spanish Broadcasting System, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed in 1994, and all entities owned or controlled by Spanish Broadcasting System, Inc. and, if prior to 1994, mean our predecessor parent company Spanish Broadcasting System, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, and its subsidiaries. Our executive offices are located at 7007 N.W. 77th Avenue, Miami, Florida 33166, our telephone number is (305) 441-6901, and our corporate website is www.spanishbroadcasting.com. 
 We are a leading Spanish-language media and entertainment company with radio and/or television stations in some of the top U.S. Hispanic markets, including Puerto Rico. Our owned and operated radio stations serve markets representing approximately 34% of the U.S. Hispanic population, and our television operations serve markets representing over 3.5 million Hispanic households. We produce and distribute Spanish-language content, including radio programs, television shows, news, music and live entertainment through our radio stations and our television group, MegaTV, which produces over 60 hours of original programming per week. MegaTV broadcasts via our owned and operated stations in South Florida, Houston, and Puerto Rico and through programming and/or distribution agreements with other stations, as well as various cable and satellite providers. 
 We operate WSKQ in New York City which is the top Spanish-language radio station in the United States based on the average number of listeners per quarter-hour. WSKQ delivered the highest listenership among all Spanish-language radio stations in the United States, according to the 2018 Hispanic Fact Pack. Our other radio stations are located in Los Angeles, New York, Puerto Rico, Miami, Chicago and San Francisco. In addition to our owned and operated radio stations, we operate AIRE Radio Networks, with over 250 affiliate radio stations serving 84 of the top 100 U.S. Hispanic markets, including 47 of the top 50 Hispanic markets.  AIRE Radio Networks currently covers 94% of the coveted U.S. Hispanic market and reaches over 15 million listeners in an average week.  
 As part of our operating business, we also maintain multiple Spanish and bilingual websites that provide content related to Latin music, entertainment, news and culture, as well as the LaMusica mobile app.  The LaMusica mobile app is a music and entertainment video and audio app that programs an extensive series of short form videos, simultaneous live streams of our radio stations, hundreds of curated playlists and has tools that enable users to personalize their mobile radio streaming experience.  The new video additions to our mobile app significantly enhance the audience’s engagement level and increase the reach of our mobile offering.  In addition, we produce live concerts and events in the United States and Puerto Rico. Concerts generate revenue from ticket sales, sponsorship and promotions, raise awareness of our brands in the surrounding communities and provide our advertising partners additional opportunities to reach their target audience. 
 Our Strategy 
 We focus on maximizing the revenue and profitability of our broadcast portfolio by strengthening the performance of our existing broadcast stations. Our operating strategy focuses on maximizing our broadcast stations’ appeal to our targeted audiences and advertisers in order to increase revenue and cash flow, while simultaneously controlling operating expenses. To achieve these goals, we focus on a number of key factors. 
 Develop Market Leading Station Clusters in High Growth Hispanic Markets. We believe Hispanic media will gain revenue share as a result of the growing U.S. Hispanic population and its growing buying power. Given our knowledge of, and experience with, the U.S. Hispanic marketplace and our established position in the top U.S. Hispanic markets, including Puerto Rico, we will continue to focus on reaching and maximizing revenue in high growth Hispanic markets. We believe that operating multiple stations in the same markets enables us to achieve operating efficiencies and cost savings. We pursue a strategy of creating broadcast station clusters that reach a critical mass of our target audience and marketing resources necessary to aggressively pursue incremental advertising revenue.

Leverage Our Proprietary Content Across Our Media Platforms. We will continue to monetize our content across multiple platforms, including radio, broadcast and pay television and live events, as well as emerging media technologies. We use our media platforms and relationships with Hispanic celebrities and talent to produce unique programming and content for our television and radio stations. Concerts and special promotional appearances form an important part of our marketing strategy and provide us with significant local market exposure. We also develop content from these events and create opportunities to sell, market and distribute that content through our websites and other media, providing our advertising partners with attractive advertising solutions. In addition, the events allow us to promote our brands to increase our radio audience and advertising revenue. As the media landscape evolves, we are developing our key broadcast programs, on-air personalities and brands for consumption as downloadable video and interactive content.
Maintain Cost Discipline and Reduce Our Costs. We employ a regimented managerial approach to operating our media outlets. We emphasize control of our operating costs through detailed budgeting, continuous review of staffing levels and expenses and vendor analysis.  We are highly focused on reducing our costs and believe we have streamlined our cost structure to provide a foundation for growth.
Maintain Strong Community Involvement. We have been, and will continue to be, actively involved in the local communities that we serve. Our broadcast stations participate in numerous community programs, fundraisers and activities benefiting the local community and Hispanics abroad. Examples of our community involvement include free public service announcements, free events designed to promote family values within the local Hispanic communities, extensive coverage of world events that have an impact on the U.S. Hispanic population as well as charitable contributions to organizations that benefit the local Hispanic communities in which we operate. Our community involvement also allows us to keep abreast of shifting audience preferences, to further tailor our content and to enhance broadcast station loyalty.

Hispanic Market Opportunity
The U.S. Hispanic population is the largest ethnic minority group and is projected to be the fastest growing segment of the population. We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the projected growth in population and buying power of the U.S. Hispanic population and the expected shift of advertising dollars to Hispanic media. We believe that targeting the Hispanic market is attractive for the following reasons: 

• | Hispanic Population Growth. Between the years 2000 and 2018, the U.S. Hispanic population increased by 68.1% compared to 8.8% for the non-Hispanic population. In 2018, Hispanics comprised 18.3% of the U.S. population and more than one out of every six individuals living in the United States was of Hispanic origin, according to the Selig Center for Economic Growth, The Multicultural Economy, 2018. The U.S. Hispanic population grew at more than seven times the rate of the general population from 2000 to 2015 and is projected to grow to 31% of the U.S. population by 2060, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Hispanics have accounted for nearly half of the U.S. population growth since the 2010 Census.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growth in Hispanic Buying Power. The U.S. Hispanic population accounted for $1.5 trillion of total buying power in 2018, up from $1.0 trillion in 2010 and is estimated to grow to $1.9 trillion by 2023, according to the Selig Center for Economic Growth, The Multicultural Economy, 2018. U.S. Hispanic buying power accounted for 10.4% of all U.S. buying power in 2018. By 2023, Hispanics will account for 11.2% of total U.S. buying power.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Spanish-Language Advertising Spending. Advertisers spent an estimated $9.2 billion on Spanish-language media advertising in 2017, according to the 2018 Hispanic Fact Pack. This amount has more than quadrupled since 2000 when Hispanic advertising expenditures totaled $2.1 billion according to Hispanic Business Magazine, December 2001. As advertisers increasingly recognize the buying power of the U.S. Hispanic population, especially in markets with high Hispanic concentration, we believe that Spanish-language advertising will continue to increase.

Our Strengths 
 Strong Presence in the Largest U.S. Hispanic Markets. We operate in six of the eight largest U.S. Hispanic markets: Los Angeles, New York, Miami, San Francisco, Chicago and Houston, as well as also operating in Puerto Rico. We operate three of the top six Spanish-language radio stations in the United States. Our New York station (WSKQ-FM) ranks first among Spanish-language radio stations in terms of highest listenership. The New York and Los Angeles markets, where we consistently have a top-three-rated Spanish-language radio station, have the largest and second largest U.S. Hispanic populations, respectively. Los Angeles and New York are also, respectively, the largest and second largest overall radio markets in the United States as measured by advertising revenue. In addition, MegaTV serves markets representing over 3.5 million Hispanic households.
Strong Portfolio of Branded Media Franchises. Because of our history with Hispanic-focused media, we believe that we have been able to develop strong relationships with the Hispanic audiences in our markets and create strong brand loyalty. Our listeners enjoy music from popular and emerging artists as well as updated local information on weather, news and general entertainment. Our live concerts and events provide our advertisers additional opportunities to reach their target audiences as well as allow us to cross-promote our brands and diversify our revenue base.
Diversification across Media Platforms, Geography and Customers. Our programming reaches audiences across U.S. Hispanic communities and across various media distribution platforms. We sell our advertising time both nationally and locally and generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of advertising time to a broad and geographically diverse customer base. The diversification of our stations across several local markets helps to mitigate any revenue decline in a specific geographic area. Additionally, in 2018, no single advertiser generated more than 5% of our consolidated revenue. Our customer base includes advertisers in the automotive, retail, telecommunications and healthcare industries, among others. In addition to advertising revenue, we also generate subscription and retransmission fee revenue from MegaTV.
Attractive Business Model. Our strong margins and low levels of capital expenditures enable us to generate high levels of station operating cash flows. We also benefit from an attractive operating cost structure that provides significant operating leverage while allowing us ongoing operating flexibility in light of the limits to our financial flexibility.  
Experienced Management Team. Led by Raúl Alarcón, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, our senior management team has, on average, over 20 years of experience in the broadcasting sector. Importantly, the Alarcón family has been involved in Spanish-language radio broadcasting since the 1950s, when the late Mr. Pablo Raúl Alarcón, our former Chairman Emeritus, established his first radio station in Camagüey, Cuba. We believe that our experienced management team gives us a unique understanding of the various Hispanic ethnic and cultural subgroups and allows us to effectively tailor our broadcast programming, websites and concerts accordingly.
Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts
 We have not repaid our outstanding Notes since they became due on April 17, 2017, and we continue to evaluate all options available to refinance the Notes.  While we assess how to best achieve a successful refinancing of the Notes, we have continued to pay interest on the Notes, payments that a group of investors purporting to own our Series B preferred stock have challenged through the institution of litigation in the Delaware Court of Chancery as described below.  The complaint filed by these investors revealed a purported foreign ownership of our Series B preferred stock, which we are actively addressing, including before the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) in order to protect our broadcast licenses.  Our refinancing efforts have been made more difficult and complex by the Series B preferred stock litigation and foreign ownership issue. We provide more information about each of these items below.
Notes
 As of the date of this Annual Report, there was $249.9 million in principal amount of Notes outstanding.  As a result, there has been and remains an event of default under the Indenture which gives the holders of our Notes the right to demand repayment of the Notes and, subject to the terms of the Indenture, to foreclose on our assets that serve as collateral for the Notes.  The collateral constitutes substantially all of our assets.  We continue to pay interest on the Notes at their current rate of 12.5% per year on a monthly basis.  We sold our Los Angeles real estate for $14.7 milion and a portion of our Puerto Rico television spectrum for $5.5 million, in 2017.  During the third quarter of 2018, we sold our New York real estate for $14.0 million. We used the net proceeds from the sales of our Los Angeles and New York real estate and the sale of the Puerto Rico television spectrum to repay a portion of the Notes.

The Series B Preferred Stock Litigation
 Persons claiming to own 94.16% of our Series B preferred stock filed a complaint against us in the Delaware Court of Chancery, in Cedarview Opportunities Master Fund, L.P., et al. v. Spanish Broadcasting System, Inc. (Del.Ct.Ch. C.A. No. 2017-0785-AGB), on November 2, 2017, which was subsequently amended. The complaint, as amended (the “Preferred Holder Complaint”), alleges counts for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and specific performance regarding the Certificate of Designations governing the Series B preferred stock (the “Certificate of Designations”) in connection with a forbearance agreement we entered into with certain Noteholders on May 8, 2017 (the “Forbearance Agreement”) and breach of our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter”) and for a declaratory judgment regarding the validity of a provision of the Charter regarding the foreign ownership issues described below.  Specifically, it alleges that the Forbearance Agreement (which expired on May 31, 2017) and certain payments pursuant thereto were barred by the Certificate of Designations due to the existence of a “Voting Rights Triggering Event” under the Certificate of Designations because, among other things, the forbearance agreement allegedly constituted a “de facto” extension or refinancing of the Notes. The Preferred Holder Complaint alleges that SBS breached the Charter by suspending certain rights of the Series B preferred stockholders, and that Section 10.4 of the Charter is overbroad and thus invalid as a matter of Delaware law. The complaint requests relief including, among other things, an order interpreting and enforcing the Certificate of Designations, preventing us from making any additional payments on the Notes and requiring us to redeem the Series B preferred stock at face value plus accrued dividends (or approximately $175.3 million as of December 31, 2018), as well as unspecified money damages and a declaration that Section 10.4 of the Charter is invalid.  This is the fourth lawsuit filed against us by holders or purported holders of our Series B preferred stock, the first three of which we successfully challenged and won. We believe these claims are without merit, and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously.  We have filed a motion to dismiss these claims, for which oral argument was heard on April 12, 2018. We received a ruling on the motion to dismiss on August 27, 2018. The ruling granted our motion to dismiss in part and denied it in part. The court dismissed the claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and dismissed the claim for specific performance (insofar as it sought a redemption of the Series B preferred stock) and dismissed the claim for a declaratory judgment regarding the Charter (insofar as it sought a declaration that Section 10.4 of the Charter is invalid on the face). The other claims in the Preferred Holder Complaint were not dismissed. 
Foreign Ownership Issue
 We take the position that the ownership of our 
shares, both common and Series B Preferred Stock, by those stockholders that validly secured their shares in accordance with the requirements of the Charter was validly constituted and does not result in a violation of the Communications Act or the FCC’s
 implementing rules.  However, if legal recognition is given to the purchase by certain foreign entities and individuals of Series B Preferred Stock in amounts that exceed the limits of the Charter, the Communications Act, and the FCC’s rules, then a violation may exist.  This conclusion would be based on claims made in the Preferred Holder Complaint, the accuracy of which we have not conceded, which asserted that the collective ownership of the outstanding Series B preferred stock by foreign entities (as defined below) exceeded 63 percent of the outstanding Series B preferred stock. As discussed below under “Federal Regulation of Radio and Television Broadcasting – Foreign Ownership,” Section 310(b) of the Communications Act prohibits foreign entities from holding in excess of 25 percent of the equity in the Company absent the affirmative consent of the FCC.  During our review, we also determined that the current ownership of the Series B preferred stock appeared to violate the foreign ownership restrictions set forth in the Charter.
 Article X of our Charter contains provisions governing foreign ownership of our capital stock and compliance with Section 310 of the Communications Act. These provisions of our Charter restrict foreign ownership in us to not more than 25 percent of the aggregate number of our shares of capital stock outstanding in any class or series entitled to vote on any matter.  In addition, the last paragraph of Article X of the Charter provides that any transfers of our equity securities that would either violate (or would result in a violation of) the Communications Act or that required prior approval of the FCC are “ineffective.”  As a result, in reviewing the Preferred Holder Complaint, we have taken the position that if this provision is given effect, certain of those transfers, when attempted, appear to have been in contravention of the Charter and the Communications Act, and were therefore void as a legal matter when they were attempted.  In addition, to the extent that those transactions required prior FCC approval or, if given effect, would have placed the Company in violation of the foreign ownership restrictions set forth in the Communications Act, those transactions were ineffective and void by operation of the Charter, and are therefore deemed to have never occurred. 
 Given the information that was disclosed to us in the Preferred Holder Complaint regarding the purported ownership of a majority of the Series B preferred stock by foreign entities, we were required to take immediate remedial action in order to ensure that any violations of the Communications Act and our Charter resulting from that ownership did not adversely affect our FCC broadcast licenses and ability to continue our business operations.  Accordingly, on November 28, 2017, consistent with our obligations and authority provided to us under the Communications Act and by Article X of our Charter, we notified holders of our Series B Preferred Stock that we were suspending all rights, effective immediately, of the holders of the Series B preferred stock, other than their right to transfer their shares to a citizen of the United States.  We added that such suspension of rights would remain in place with respect to each holder of the Series B preferred stock until we had concluded that (1) the shares of such holder should be treated as not owned by 
 7


aliens or their representatives, as these terms are used under the Communications Act, or (2) the ownership by the purported holders of the Series B preferred stock (including the ownership of any shares by foreign entities) complies with the requirements of the Communications Act and our Charter.  Such suspension of rights was meant from the outset to be a temporary and reasonable measure, intended to elicit the information necessary to determine which Series B preferred stock sales were proper under our Charter. We pledged to restore the suspended rights to each shareholder that demonstrated it was neither an alien nor a representative of an alien or upon a showing that its ownership of Series B preferred stock (including stakes held by any non-U.S. entities) complies with Section 310(b) of the Communications Act and our Charter.
 We communicated to these purported holders and their counsel the urgent need for information from them so we could understand the details of the transactions under which these parties claim to have acquired their Series B preferred stock, and the ownership of our equity securities that is claimed by them. On that date, we also filed with the Commission a Current Report on Form 8-K summarizing the information request and the potential consequences of excessive foreign ownership of the Series B preferred stock.  Without this information, we cannot determine which holders in fact own Series B preferred stock and which do not because of the effect of the provisions contained in the Charter that protect us against a violation of the Communications Act and the 25 percent limitation on foreign ownership in an entity controlling an FCC licensee in the absence of FCC approval.  We took this action in order to safeguard our most important assets, our FCC broadcast licenses, which would otherwise potentially be at risk if we failed to take appropriate measures to remain in compliance with the Communications Act.
  On January 9, 2018, as a follow-up to the November 28, 2017 notice, we issued a second public notice requesting additional information from the holders of the Series B preferred stock.  We sought additional information from the holders of the Series B Preferred stock regarding their purported acquisition and claimed ownership of the Series B Preferred stock.
 In our communications, we also announced that we would issue foreign share certificates containing a restrictive legend in accordance with the requirements of the Charter. However, we were unable to do so because of a lack of ownership information from the holders of the Series B Preferred stock. The purported holders of the Series B preferred stock did not fully and adequately respond to our two requests for information (on November 28, 2017 and January 9, 2018) that would allow us to determine which holders should receive foreign share certificates and to reinstitute the rights of all holders of Series B preferred stock that were within legal limits.
 Additionally, on November 13, 2017, we filed a notification with the FCC to apprise the FCC of the possible non-compliance with the Communications Act’s limits on foreign ownership.   On December 4, 2017, we also filed a petition with the FCC for declaratory ruling (the “Petition”) with respect to the potential excess foreign ownership.  We filed the Petition not because we had concluded that an affirmative FCC public interest ruling regarding recognized foreign ownership was required, but at the suggestion of FCC staff to ensure we had prophylactically availed ourselves of the “safe harbor” protections of Section 1.5004(f)(4) of the FCC’s Rules, in the event such a declaratory ruling ultimately proved necessary. This suggestion came after we had previously notified the FCC of a possible Section 310(b) foreign ownership issue triggered by the filing of the Preferred Holder Complaint.  The FCC responded to the Petition by sending us a letter detailing the information the FCC would need regarding the identities and nature of the purported foreign ownership of the Series B preferred stock to make a determination regarding our P
etition and establishing a deadline for the disclosure of that information.  The purported Series B preferred stockholders were therefore required to provide us with sufficient information about the extent and nature of their foreign ownership to enable us to supplement the Petition with this additional information.  On March 23, 2018, counsel for the purported holders of most of the Series B preferred stock filed a letter with the FCC supplying a significant portion of the information requested. We reviewed this information in order to determine whether it was complete, true and correct, as required by the FCC’s rules, and requested some additional information from the Series B preferred stockholders.  The purported Series B preferred stockholders did not provide any additional information regarding the timing of their alleged purchases of Series B preferred stock until December 5, 2018. On that date, such stockholders filed responses to our interrogatories in the Series B Preferred Stock Litigation. These responses contained a significant portion of the pending information that was originally solicited on November 2017 and January 2018, respectively. The new information mainly consisted of the trading information in the Series B preferred stock, including dates of acquisition, the number of shares purportedly acquired in each transaction and, to the extent available, seller information.  On December 6, 2018, we received a letter from the Enforcement Bureau of the Investigations and Hearings Division (the “Bureau”) of the FCC advising us that we were under investigation for potential violations of Section 310(b) of the Communications Act related to excess foreign ownership of broadcast stations.  As part of its investigation, the Bureau requested of us detailed information and supporting documentation about the identities of the Series B preferred stockholders, the potential for a foreign ownership violation, the dates that we became aware of the situation, and the steps we took to address the situation.  We timely filed our response to the Bureau’s letter of inquiry on February 8, 2019.  As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not received a response or any additional inquiries from the Bureau regarding this investigation.

Previously, on April 27, 2018, the Company had announced publicly that the purported foreign ownership excess did not exist.  On this date, the Company issued Notices of Ineffective Purported Purchase of Series B Preferred Stock (the “Notices”) to each of West Face Long Term Opportunities Global Master L.P., Stornoway Recovery Fund LP, Stonehill Master Fund Ltd. and Ravensource Fund notifying these investors that their claimed purchases of Series B preferred stock would be treated as void and non-existent because these investors attempted to acquire these shares in transactions that, if given effect, would have violated the Charter. In the Notices, the Company invited these investors to demonstrate facts to the contrary supported by relevant documentation. As of the date of this Annual Report, these investors have not provided the Company with any facts or provided any documentation that would support a different legal conclusion.
 As stated above, we take the position that certain of the purported non-U.S. preferred stockholders do not currently hold valid equity interests in us, with the result that there is no foreign ownership excess. For this reason, we did not claim in our Petition or any supplement thereto that it would be in the public interest for the relevant entities to hold aggregate interests exceeding the 25 percent foreign ownership benchmark. As stated in the original Petition, we then recognized that our showing “is not yet complete with respect to the FCC’s ability to render a decision regarding the … public interest inquiry.”  Because the share transfers that gave rise to some or all of the Series B preferred stock ownership claims of several purported non-U.S. preferred stockholders are invalid, there would be no need for such a showing unless a court first determines that the suspect transactions must be honored. Accordingly, both the Company and the purported Series B preferred stockholders have suggested that the FCC should consider simply holding the Petition in abeyance until the Series B Preferred Stock Litigation is resolved.
 As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company believes that there remain genuine questions regarding valid ownership, or good title, to the Series B preferred stock purportedly held by these foreign investors.  As a result, we intend to remain vigilant regarding compliance with the Communications Act and our Charter and will continue to evaluate information provided to us by the purported holders of the Series B preferred stock. Because we have not yet received all of the requisite information from the purported holders, we have been unable to effectively determine whether to withdraw the suspension of their rights as owners of such preferred stock or to the extent of any additional remedial action by the Company that may be necessary.    Continuing Efforts to Refinance the Notes
 We have worked and continue to work with our advisors regarding a consensual recapitalization or restructuring of our balance sheet, including through the issuance of new debt or equity to raise the necessary funds to repay the Notes.  The Series B preferred stock litigation and the foreign ownership issue have complicated our efforts at a successful refinancing of the Notes.  We believe that the delay in refinancing the Notes has adversely affected us, including because we have been paying substantially more in interest expense on our outstanding Notes than would be the case if we refinanced them in the current market based on the feedback we have received from several financial institutions and potential sources of capital; there is a cloud on title regarding who validly owns our Series B preferred stock, which has created uncertainty as to who owns these shares, and the parties with whom the Company could potentially negotiate a consensual restructuring; we are incurring higher legal costs than otherwise would be the case due to our efforts to resolve the situation in general, to defend ourselves against the Series B preferred stock litigation and to address the foreign ownership issue before the FCC we describe above; the trading price of our common stock and preferred stock has been materially adversely affected; our ability to attract interest from investment banks and third party capital suppliers has been materially adversely affected; our reputation has been similarly negatively affected as a general matter despite our diligent efforts to resolve the situation; and the negativity and complexity surrounding our situation has been an unfortunate distraction from our otherwise successful business.  The resolution of the recapitalization or restructuring of our balance sheet, the litigation with the purported holders of our Series B preferred stock and the foreign ownership issue are subject to several factors currently beyond our control.  Our efforts to effect a consensual refinancing of the Notes, the Series B preferred stock litigation and the foreign ownership issue will likely continue to have a material adverse effect on us if they are not successfully resolved.  We face various risks regarding these matters.  See “Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Preferred Stock.”

Owned and Operated Radio Station Programming 
 We format the programming of each of our radio stations to target a substantial share of the U.S. Hispanic audience in its respective market. The U.S. Hispanic population is diverse, consisting of numerous identifiable groups from many different countries of origin and each with its own musical and cultural heritage. The music, culture, customs and Spanish dialects vary from one radio market to another. We strive to become very familiar with the musical tastes and preferences of each of the various Hispanic ethnic groups and customize our programming to match the local preferences of our target demographic audience in each market we serve. By employing listener study groups and surveys, we can respond immediately, if necessary, to any changing preferences of listeners and/or trends by refining our programming to reflect the results of our research and testing. Each of our programming formats is described below. 

• | Spanish Tropical. The Spanish Tropical format primarily consists of salsa, merengue, bachata and Latin Rhythmic music. Salsa is dance music combining Latin Caribbean rhythms with jazz originating from Puerto Rico, Cuba and the Dominican Republic, which is popular with the Hispanics whom we target in New York, Miami and Puerto Rico. Merengue music is up-tempo dance music originating in the Dominican Republic. Bachata is a softer tempo dance music also originating in the Dominican Republic. Latin Rhythmic is a modern dance genre that has evolved into a mix of Spanish- and English-language dance hall, traditional reggae, Latin pop and Spanish hip-hop and Cubaton.

• | Regional Mexican. The Regional Mexican format consists of various types of music played in different regions of Mexico such as ranchera, norteña, banda and cumbia. Ranchera music, originating from Jalisco, Mexico, is a traditional folkloric sound commonly referred to as mariachi music. Mariachi music features acoustical instruments and is considered the music indigenous to Mexicans who live in country towns. Norteña means northern, and is representative of Northern Mexico. Featuring an accordion, norteña has a polka sound with a distinct Mexican flavor. Banda is a regional format from the state of Sinalóa, Mexico and is popular in California. Banda resembles up-tempo marching band music with synthesizers.

• | Spanish Adult Contemporary. The Spanish Adult Contemporary format includes soft romantic ballads and Spanish pop music as well as international hits from Puerto Rico, Mexico, Latin America and Spain.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Top 40. The Top 40 format consists of the most popular current Latin and English chart hits.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Latin Rhythmic. The Latin Rhythmic format consists of Reggaeton and Tropi-Pop which is a mix of upbeat pop and tropical music.

 Television Strategy
Mega TV’s programming is based on a strategy designed to showcase a combination of programs, ranging from televised radio-branded shows to news and general entertainment programs, such as music, celebrity, debate, interviews and personality-based shows. On the forefront of digital platforms, we were the first Spanish-language programmer to broadcast in 100% native High Definition (“HD”) in the United States and one of the first Spanish-language programmers in the United States to launch content on Video On Demand, known as VOD. 
 As part of our strategy, we have incorporated certain of our radio on-air personalities into our television programming, as well as including interactive elements to complement our Internet websites. We produce over 60 hours of original programming per week. Our television revenue is generated primarily from the sale of local advertising and paid programming. Advertising rates depend primarily on our ability to attract an audience in the demographic groups targeted by our advertisers, the number of stations in the market we compete with for the same audience, and the supply of and demand for television advertising time, as well as other qualitative factors. We also generate revenue from the sale of integrated sponsorships and program syndication. 
 Our Miami facility for our media broadcast programming and production is nearly 70,000 square feet and houses the bulk of MegaTV’s national and local market operations. With over 14,000 square feet of HD TV-Studio production space, the building was remodeled to handle the majority of MegaTV’s diverse original HD programming, while also accommodating outside production clients with its wide range of production capabilities, which can include anything from news to late-night variety shows with live band and studio audiences. MegaTV’s long-term technical design criteria for this facility placed an emphasis on streamlined production workflows and digital media management. Key technical features of this facility include: 
  
• | integrated HD/standard definition (“SD”) file-based content capabilities throughout our studio, post production and master control areas;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | three HD studio production spaces that can be operated independently or combined;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | two fully equipped HD control rooms with server, editing and mastering capabilities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 14 HD/SD post production editing suites that include advanced technology in networked solutions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satellite downlink antenna farm and extensive fiber connectivity for content contribution and distribution; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | multi-path, redundant HD server-based master control system responsible for our distribution feeds.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Miami facility also includes office space for production and back-office personnel, as well as dressing rooms, make-up rooms and green rooms for our on-air talent and studio guests. 
 14


We also have 3,500 square feet of HD TV-Studio production space in Puerto Rico with a fully equipped HD control room and six edit suites. 
 Special Events and On-Line Properties 
 As part of our media operating business, we also operate SBS Entertainment and SBS Interactive. SBS Entertainment is a premier producer of unique entertainment, concerts and special events. We generate special events revenue from ticket sales and event sponsorships, as well as profit-sharing arrangements by producing or co-producing live concerts and live experience events with popular artists, which are promoted by our radio, television and digital media assets. SBS Interactive manages LaMusica.com, Mega.tv, various radio station websites, and the LaMusica Mobile App. All of the digital properties offer bilingual (Spanish-English) content related to Latin music, entertainment, cultural & market trends, lifestyle, and news. LaMusica and our multiple social media networks generate revenue primarily from advertising and sponsorships. In addition, the majority of our social media networks and station websites simultaneously stream our radio stations content which has broadened our audience reach. We are developing brand specific digital content strategies for various broadcast programs, on-air personalities and brands, and intend to generate revenue from such strategies. We also leverage many of our special events produced by SBS Entertainment, to produce music based digital content for live streaming and/or taped, on-demand streaming, which can also be developed to generate revenue. 
 We believe that SBS Entertainment and SBS Interactive, together with our broadcast portfolio, enable our audience to enjoy targeted and culturally relevant entertainment, which include, but are not limited to concert specials, artist interviews, music editorial content, music reviews, and local entertainment calendars, among others. At the same time, our online properties enable our advertisers to reach their targeted Hispanic consumers through an additional, targeted and dynamic medium. 
 Advertising Revenue
The vast majority of our revenue is derived from cash advertising sales. Advertising revenue has historically been classified into three categories – “national”, “network” and” local”.  “National” generally refers to advertising that is solicited by a representative firm for advertisers out of the Designated Market Area (“DMA”).  Our national sales representative for our radio stations is McGavern Guild Media, LLC.   “Network” advertising revenue is advertising revenue sold to network advertisers expecting to reach 70% plus of the U.S. national radio audience in a specific demographic group. The network advertising buys are sold by our AIRE Radio Networks group.  “Local” refers to advertising purchased by advertisers and agencies in the local market served by a particular station. 
 Current trends in the media advertising market have changed the long-established model for categorizing advertising revenue. We have expanded the conventional model by offering “integrated sponsorship” or “branded entertainment” opportunities, which are highly sought after and command a higher investment from clients, in order to maximize our advertisers’ opportunities. We expect that our primary source of revenue from our broadcast stations will be generated from the sale of national, local and integrated sponsorship advertising. In addition, we are anticipating that our television, radio and interactive offerings will generate more advertising opportunities by offering multi-media packages. 
 We believe that the broadcasting industry is one of the most efficient and cost-effective means for advertisers to reach targeted demographic groups, primarily Adults 18-49. Advertising rates charged by a station are based primarily on the station’s ability to attract an audience in a given market and on the attractiveness to advertisers of the station’s audience demographics, as well as the demand on available advertising inventory. Rates also vary depending upon a program’s ratings among the listeners/viewers an advertiser is seeking to attract and the availability of alternative media in the market. Radio advertising rates generally are highest during the morning drive-time hours, which are the peak hours for radio audience listening. Television advertising rates are higher during prime time evening viewing periods. A broadcaster that has multiple stations in a market appeals to national advertisers because these advertisers can reach more listeners and viewers, thus enabling the broadcaster to attract a greater share of the advertising revenue in a given market. In light of these factors, we seek to grow our revenue by taking advantage of our presence in major Hispanic markets as new and existing advertisers recognize the increasing desirability of targeting the growing U.S. Hispanic population. 
 Each station broadcasts a predetermined number of advertisements per hour with the actual number depending upon the format of a particular station and any programming strategy we are utilizing to attract an audience. We also determine the number of advertisements broadcast hourly that can maximize the station’s revenue without negatively impacting its audience listener/viewer levels. While there may be shifts from time to time in the number of advertisements broadcast during a particular time of the day, the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year. 
 15


It is customary in the radio, television, and interactive industry that the majority of advertising contracts with our advertisers are short-term and generally run for less than three months. This affords broadcasters the opportunity to modify advertising rates as dictated by changes in audience ratings, changes in competitive dynamics and changes in the business climate within a particular market. In each of our broadcasting markets, we employ sales personnel to obtain local advertising revenue. Our local sales force is responsible for maintaining relationships with key local advertisers and agencies and identifying new advertisers. We pay commissions to our local sales staff upon receipt of payment for their respective billings which assist in our collection efforts. 
 Seasonality
Seasonal broadcasting revenue fluctuations are common in the broadcasting industry and are primarily due to fluctuations in advertising expenditures by local, national, and network advertisers. Our net broadcasting revenues vary throughout the year. Historically, our first calendar quarter (January through March) has generally produced the lowest net broadcasting revenue for the year because of routine post-holiday decreases in advertising expenditures. 
Competition 
 The success of our broadcast stations depends significantly upon their audience ratings and their share of the overall advertising revenue within their markets. The radio and television broadcasting industries are highly competitive businesses. Each of our radio stations compete with both Spanish-language and English-language radio stations in their market, as well as other media, such as newspapers, broadcast television, cable television, interactive, magazines, outdoor advertising, satellite radio, and transit advertising. Our television operations compete for viewers and revenue with both Spanish-language and English-language television stations in our local markets, as well as nationally broadcast television operations, cable television, interactive and other video media. 
 Several of the broadcast stations with which we compete are subsidiaries of larger national or regional companies that have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may not be undergoing a recapitalization strategy, such as the one we are pursuing. Factors which are material to our competitive position include:
  
• | management experience;
--+-----------------------


• | talent and popularity of on-air personalities and television show hosts and actors;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | audience ratings, impressions, and our broadcast stations’ rank in their markets;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | sales talent and experience;
--+-----------------------------


• | signal strength and frequency; and
--+-----------------------------------


• | audience demographics, including the nature of the Spanish-language market targeted by a particular station.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Although the broadcast industry is highly competitive, some barriers to entry do exist. These barriers can be mitigated to some extent by changing existing broadcast station formats and programming and upgrading power, among other actions. The operation of a broadcast station requires a license or other authorization from the FCC. The number of AM radio stations that can operate in a given market is limited by the availability of AM radio spectrum in the market. The number of FM radio stations and television stations that can operate in a given market is limited by the availability of those frequencies allotted by the FCC to communities in such market. In addition, the FCC’s multiple ownership rules regulate the number of stations that may be owned and controlled by a single entity in a given market. For a discussion of FCC regulation, see “—Federal Regulation of Radio and Television Broadcasting.”   
 The radio industry is also subject to competition from new media technologies that are being developed or introduced, such as the delivery of audio programming by satellite, cable television systems and Internet-based music streaming services. Some radio broadcast stations, including ours, are utilizing digital technology on their existing terrestrial frequencies to deliver audio programming. The FCC also has licensed “low power” radio stations that provide low-cost noncommercial neighborhood service on frequencies which would not interfere with existing stations. 
 The FCC has authorized HD Radio ® technology which permits a station to transmit radio programming in digital formats using the bandwidth that the radio station is currently licensed to use.  HD Radio ® technology is used to (1) improve sound quality, (2) provide spectrum for enhanced data services and multiple program streams and (3) allow radio stations to time broker unused digital bandwidth to third parties, thereby providing new business opportunities for radio broadcasters. We currently utilize HD Radio ® digital technology on some of our stations and will evaluate additional installations over the next few years. 
 16


The delivery of information through the presently minimally regulated Internet has also created a new and growing form of competition for both radio and television. Internet broadcasts generally have no geographic limitations and can provide listeners with programming from around the country and the world. We expect that improvements from higher bandwidths, faster download speeds and wider programming selection will make Internet radio a more significant competitor in the future.  We continue to develop and expand our own websites and digital content. 
 The variety and quality of video and audio content on the internet continues to expand. Internet companies have developed business relationships with companies that have traditionally provided syndicated programming, network television and other content. As a result, additional programming continues to become available through nontraditional methods, which can directly impact the number of TV viewers and radio listeners and thus indirectly impact station rankings, popularity and revenue possibilities from our stations. We cannot assure you that the development or introduction of any new media technology will not have an adverse effect on the radio and television broadcasting industries. 
 We cannot predict what other matters may be considered in the future by the FCC, nor can we assess in advance what impact, if any, the implementation of any of these proposals or changes may have on our business. See “—Federal Regulation of Radio and Television Broadcasting.”   
 Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses 
 In the course of our business, we use various trademarks, copyrights, trade names, domain names and service marks, including logos, with our products and services in our programming, advertising and promotions. Trademarks and copyrights are of material importance to our business and are protected by registration or otherwise in the United States, including Puerto Rico. We believe our trademarks, copyrights, trade names, domain names and service marks are important to our business, and we intend to continue to protect and promote them where appropriate and to protect the registration of new trademarks and copyrights, including through legal action. We do not hold or depend upon any material government license, franchise or concession, except that we hold and depend upon the broadcast licenses granted by the FCC and hold certain trademarks granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. 
Environmental Matters 
 As the owner, lessee or operator of various real properties and facilities, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot assure you; however, that compliance with existing or new environmental laws and regulations will not require us to make significant expenditures of funds. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 348 full-time employees and 94 part-time employees. In July 2016, SAG-AFTRA was certified as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of a bargaining unit of approximately 30 employees at our Los Angeles-based stations KXOL and KLAX.  In October 2018, SAG-AFTRA was also certified as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of a bargaining unit of approximately 10 employees at our Chicago-based station WLEY.  We have been negotiating with representatives of SAG-AFTRA for initial collective bargaining agreements covering those bargaining units. To date, we have not yet reached initial collective bargaining agreements with SAG-AFTRA covering either bargaining unit.   
 Our business depends upon the efforts, abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key employees, including on-air talent, as well as our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers and key employees, particularly Raúl Alarcón, Chairman of our Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President, could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Antitrust 
 We have completed, and in the future may complete, strategic acquisitions and divestitures in order to achieve a significant presence with clusters of stations in the top U.S. Hispanic markets. As a result of the industry consolidation resulting from the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the “Act”), the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), the federal agencies responsible for enforcing the federal antitrust laws, have reviewed certain proposed acquisitions of broadcast stations and station networks. The DOJ can be particularly aggressive when the proposed buyer already owns one or more broadcast stations in the market of the station it is seeking to buy and, following a proposed acquisition, would garner a substantial portion of the advertising revenues in a market. The DOJ has challenged a number of broadcasting transactions. Some of those 
 17


challenges ultimately resulted in consent decrees requiring, among other things, divestitures of certain stations. As part of its scrutiny of station acquisitions, the DOJ has stated publicly that it believes that commencement of operations under time brokerage agreements, local marketing agreements and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with station transfers prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), could violate the HSR Act. In connection with acquisitions, subject to the waiting period under the HSR Act, so long as the DOJ policy on the issue remains unchanged, we would not expect to commence operation of any affected station under a time brokerage agreement, local marketing agreement or similar agreement until the waiting period has expired or been terminated. 
 Federal Regulation of Radio and Television Broadcasting 
 General 
 The radio and television broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing regulation by the FCC with regard to programming, technical operations, employment, ownership and other business practices. The FCC regulates broadcast stations pursuant to the Communications Act. The Communications Act permits the operation of broadcast stations only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of a license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. The Communications Act provides for the FCC to exercise its licensing authority to provide a fair, efficient and equitable distribution of broadcast service throughout the United States. Among other things, the FCC: 

• | assigns frequency bands for radio and television broadcasting;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | determines the particular frequencies, locations and operating power of radio and television broadcast stations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | issues, renews, revokes and modifies radio and television broadcast station licenses;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishes technical requirements for certain transmitting equipment used by radio and television broadcast stations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation, program content and employment and business practices of radio and television broadcast stations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | has the power to impose penalties, including monetary forfeitures and license revocations, for violations of its rules and the Communications Act; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regulates certain aspects of the operation of cable and direct broadcast satellite systems and certain other electronic media that compete with broadcast stations.

 The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and specific FCC rules and policies. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to the text of the Communications Act, the FCC’s rules and regulations, and the rulings of the FCC. You should refer to the Communications Act and these FCC rules, regulations and rulings for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations. A licensee’s failure to observe the requirements of the Communications Act or FCC rules and policies may result in the imposition of various sanctions, including admonishment, fines, the grant of renewal terms of less than eight years, the grant of a license with conditions or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application, the revocation of an FCC broadcast license or the denial of FCC consent to acquire additional broadcast properties, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our operations. 
 FCC Licenses 
 The Communications Act provides that a broadcast station license may be granted to any applicant if the granting of the application would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity, subject to certain limitations. In making licensing determinations, the FCC considers an applicant’s legal, technical, financial and other qualifications. The FCC grants radio and television broadcast station licenses for specific periods of time and, upon application, may renew them for additional terms. Under the Communications Act, radio and television broadcast station licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years. 
 The FCC classifies each AM and FM radio station. The minimum and maximum facilities requirements for an FM station are determined by its class. Some FM class designations depend upon the geographic zone in which the transmitter of the FM station is located. In general, commercial FM stations are classified as Class A, B1, C3, B, C2, C1, C0 and C, in order of increasing power and antenna height. Class C FM stations are subject to involuntary downgrades to Class C0 in various circumstances if they do not meet certain antenna height specifications. We do not operate any AM radio stations.

License Grant and Renewal
Pursuant to the Communications Act, the FCC renews broadcast licenses without a hearing upon a finding that: 
  
• | the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 After considering these factors, the FCC may grant the license renewal application with or without conditions, including renewal for a term less than the maximum term otherwise permitted by law, or hold an evidentiary hearing. 
 19


The Communications Act authorizes the filing of petitions to deny a license renewal application during specific periods of time after a renewal application has been filed. Interested parties, including members of the public, may use these petitions to raise issues concerning a renewal applicant’s qualifications. If a substantial and material question of fact concerning a renewal application is raised by the FCC or other interested parties, or if for any reason the FCC cannot determine that granting a renewal application would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity, the FCC will hold an evidentiary hearing on the application. If, as a result of an evidentiary hearing, the FCC determines that the licensee has failed to meet the requirements specified above and that no mitigating factors justify the imposition of a lesser sanction, then the FCC may deny a license renewal application. Generally, our licenses have been renewed without any material conditions or sanctions being imposed, but we cannot assure you that the licenses of each of our stations will continue to be renewed or will continue to be renewed without conditions or sanctions. A new renewal cycle will begin in June 2019 and conclude in April 2023.
 Transfers and Assignments of License
The Communications Act requires prior approval by the FCC for the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a corporation or other entity holding a license. In determining whether to approve an assignment of a radio broadcast license or a transfer of control of a broadcast licensee, the FCC considers, among other things: 
  
• | the financial and legal qualifications of the prospective assignee or transferee, including compliance with FCC restrictions on non-U.S. citizens or entity ownership and control;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with FCC rules limiting the common ownership of attributable interests in broadcast properties;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the history of compliance with FCC operating rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | the character qualifications of the transferee or assignee and the individuals or entities holding attributable interests in them.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To obtain the FCC’s prior consent to assign or transfer a broadcast license, appropriate applications must be filed with the FCC. If the assignment or transfer results in a substantial change in ownership or control, the application must be placed on public notice for a period of 30 days during which petitions to deny the application may be filed by interested parties, including members of the public. Informal objections may be filed any time up until the FCC acts upon the application. If the FCC grants an assignment or transfer application, interested parties have 30 days from public notice of the grant to seek reconsideration of that grant. The FCC has an additional ten days to set aside such grant on its own motion. When ruling on an assignment or transfer application, the FCC is prohibited from considering whether the public interest might be served by an assignment or transfer to any party other than the assignee or transferee specified in the application. 
 Foreign Ownership 
 Under the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by any corporation that has more than 20% of its capital stock directly owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens, whom the FCC refers to as “aliens,” or entities or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations (which we collectively refer to as “foreign persons” in this Annual Report). Furthermore, the Communications Act provides that no FCC broadcast license may be granted to or held by any corporation directly or indirectly controlled by any other corporation of which more than 25 percent of the capital stock is owned or voted by foreign persons, if the FCC finds the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of such license. The FCC has interpreted this provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before a broadcast license may be granted to or held by any such entity. These restrictions apply in modified form to other forms of business organizations, including partnerships and limited liability companies. Thus, the licenses for our stations could be revoked if more than 25 percent of our outstanding capital stock is issued to or for the benefit of foreign persons.  In November 2013, the FCC confirmed that it will consider on a case-by-case basis petitions for approval of foreign ownership that exceeds the 25 percent threshold and, in September 2016, the FCC adopted specific rules and procedures for the filing and review of such requests.  In the September 2016 decision, the FCC confirmed that it will allow companies to seek approval of up to 100% foreign ownership.  The FCC also adopted a methodology for determining the citizenship of the beneficial owners of publicly held shares that companies may use to ascertain compliance with the foreign ownership rules.  Our Charter provides that the transfer or conversion of our capital stock, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall not be permitted, and shall be ineffective, if such transfer or conversion would violate (or would result in violation of) the Communications Act or any of the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder or require the prior approval of the FCC, unless such prior approval has been obtained.

The Company takes the position that the current validly constituted ownership of the Company’s shares, both common and Series B Preferred Stock, was validly constituted and does not give rise to a violation of the Communications Act or the FCC’s implementing rules.  However, in reviewing the Preferred Holder Complaint, which was originally filed against us on November 2, 2017, as summarized under “—Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts—The Series B Preferred Stock Litigation,” we noted that if the alleged facts set forth in the Preferred Holder Complaint were correct, which we have not conceded, and the collective ownership of the outstanding Series B preferred stock by foreign entities exceeded 63 percent of the outstanding Series B preferred stock as stated in the Preferred Holder Complaint, then foreign entities would own well in excess of 25 percent of our equity in violation of Section 310(b)(4) of the Communications Act.  In addition, the last paragraph of Article X of the Charter provides that any transfers of the Company’s equity securities that would either violate (or would result in a violation of) the Communications Act or that required prior approval of the FCC are ineffective.  As a result, in reviewing the Preferred Holder Complaint, we take the position that if this provision is given effect, certain of those transfers, when attempted, appear to have been in contravention of the Charter and the Communications Act, and were therefore void as a legal matter when they were attempted.  In addition, to the extent that those transactions required prior FCC approval or, if given effect, would have placed the Company in violation of the foreign ownership restrictions set forth in the Communications Act, those transactions were ineffective and void by operation of the Charter, and are therefore deemed to have never occurred.
 Given the information that was disclosed to us in the Preferred Holder Complaint regarding the purported ownership of a majority of the Series B preferred stock by foreign entities, we were required to take immediate remedial action in order to ensure that any violations of the Communications Act and our Charter resulting from such ownership of the Series B preferred stock did not adversely affect our FCC broadcast licenses and ability to continue our busines
s operations.  For additional information regarding the remedial actions we have taken or are currently taking, see “—Our Continued Recapitalization and Restructuring Efforts—Foreign Ownership Issue.”
 Ownership Attribution 
 The FCC generally applies its broadcast ownership limits to “attributable” interests held by an individual, corporation, partnership or other association or entity, including limited liability companies. In the case of a corporation holding broadcast licenses, the interests of officers, directors and those who, directly or indirectly, have the right to vote 5% or more of the stock of a licensee corporation are generally deemed attributable interests, as are officer positions and directors of a corporate parent of a broadcast licensee. The FCC treats all partnership interests as attributable, except for those limited partnership interests that under FCC policies are considered insulated from material involvement in the management or operation of the media-related activities of the partnership. The FCC currently treats limited liability companies like limited partnerships for purposes of attribution. Stock interests held by insurance companies, mutual funds, bank trust departments and certain other passive investors that hold stock for investment purposes only become attributable with the ownership of 20% or more of the voting stock of the corporation holding broadcast licenses. 
 To assess whether a voting stock interest in a direct or an indirect parent corporation of a broadcast licensee is attributable, the FCC uses a “multiplier” analysis in which non-controlling voting stock interests are deemed proportionally reduced at each non-controlling link in a multi-corporation ownership chain. A time brokerage agreement with another radio or television station in the same market creates an attributable interest in the brokered radio or television station, as well as for purposes of the FCC’s local radio and television station ownership rules, if the agreement affects more than 15% of the brokered radio or television station’s weekly broadcast hours. Similarly, a radio station licensee’s right under a joint sales agreement (“JSA”) to sell more than 15% per week of the advertising time on another radio station in the same market constitutes an attributable ownership interest in such station for purposes of the FCC’s ownership rules.  Television JSAs are currently not attributable.
 Debt instruments, nonvoting stock, stock options or other nonvoting interests with rights of conversion to voting interests that have not yet been exercised, insulated limited partnership interests where the limited partner is not materially involved in the media-related activities of the partnership, and minority voting stock interests in corporations where there is a single holder of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock whose vote is sufficient to affirmatively direct the affairs of the corporation generally do not subject their holders to attribution, unless such interests implicate the FCC’s equity-debt-plus (or “EDP”) rule. Under the EDP rule, a major programming supplier or a same-market media entity will have an attributable interest in a station if the supplier or same-market media entity also holds debt or equity, or both, in the station that is greater than 33% of the value of the station’s total debt plus equity. For purposes of the EDP rule, equity includes all stock, whether voting or nonvoting, and interests held by limited partners or limited liability company members that are not materially involved. A major programming supplier is any supplier that provides more than 15% of the station’s weekly programming hours. 
 21


Multiple Ownership 
 The Communications Act and FCC rules generally restrict ownership, operation or control of, or the common holding of attributable interests in broadcast stations above certain limits serving the same local market. The FCC is required to review quadrennially the media ownership rules and to modify, repeal or retain any rules as it determines to be in the public interest. The FCC’s currently effective multiple ownership rules are briefly summarized below. 
Local Radio Ownership 
 Although current FCC rules allow one entity to own, control or hold attributable interests in an unlimited number of AM and FM radio stations nationwide, the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules limit the number of radio broadcast stations in local markets (generally defined as those counties in the Nielsen® Metro Survey Area, where they exist) in which a single entity may own an attributable interest as follows: 
  
• | In a radio market with 45 or more full-power commercial and noncommercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to eight commercial radio stations, not more than five of which are in the same service (AM or FM).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a radio market with between 30 and 44 (inclusive) full-power commercial and noncommercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to seven commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service (AM or FM).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a radio market with between 15 and 29 (inclusive) full-power commercial and noncommercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to six commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service (AM or FM).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a radio market with 14 or fewer full-power commercial and noncommercial radio stations, a party may own, operate or control up to five commercial radio stations, not more than three of which are in the same service (AM or FM), except that a party may not own, operate, or control more than 50% of the radio stations in such market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To apply these tiers, the FCC currently relies on Nielsen Metro Survey Areas, where they exist. In other areas, the FCC relies on an interim contour-overlap methodology. For radio stations located outside Nielsen® Metro Survey Areas, the market definition is based on technical service areas. The market definition used by the FCC in applying its ownership rules may not be the same as that used for purposes of the HSR Act. 
 Local Television Ownership 
 Under the ownership rules currently in place, the FCC generally permits an owner to have only one television station per market. A single owner is permitted to have two stations with overlapping signals only if one of the two commonly owned stations is not ranked in the top four based upon audience share. However, the FCC will allow case-by-case review of a transaction that involves two top-four stations where strict application of the rule would be unwarranted. The rules also permit the ownership, operation or control of two television stations in a market as long as the stations’ Noise Limited Service contours do not overlap. The FCC will consider waiving these ownership restrictions in certain cases involving failing or failed stations or stations which are not yet built. The FCC also grants satellite waivers when one or more television stations operate as satellites of another station.  We currently operate WTCV as a parent station and WVEO and WVOZ-TV as satellite stations in the Puerto Rico designated market area pursuant to a satellite waiver. Under the rule, the licensee of a television station that provides more than 15% of another in-market station’s weekly programming will be deemed to have an attributable interest in the other station.  Television JSAs are currently not attributable.  
Television National Audience Reach Limitation 
 Under the Communications Act, one party may not own TV stations which collectively reach more than 39% of all U.S. TV households. For purposes of calculating the total number of TV households reached by a station, the FCC previously applied a “UHF discount” pursuant to which a UHF TV station was attributed with only 50% of the TV households in its market.  In September 2016 the FCC eliminated the UHF discount.  The FCC provided limited grandfathering for TV station owners that exceed the 39% cap without the UHF discount.  Grandfathering will expire if combinations are assigned or transferred to a third party.  In December 2017, the FCC opened a rule making to review the national television audience reach cap and the 50% discount that was given to UHF stations in determining compliance with the national audience cap. 
 22


Programming and Operations 
 The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest. A broadcast license is required to present programming in response to community problems, needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating its responsiveness. The FCC will consider complaints from listeners about a broadcast station’s programming when it evaluates the licensee’s renewal application, but listeners’ complaints also may be filed and considered at any time. Stations also must pay regulatory and application fees, and follow various FCC rules that regulate, among other things, political advertising, equal employment opportunity, technical operation, the broadcast of obscene, indecent or profane programming, sponsorship identification, the broadcast of contest and lottery information and the conduct of contests. 
 The FCC requires that licensees not discriminate in hiring practices on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin or gender. It also requires stations with at least five full-time employees to disseminate information about all fulltime job openings and undertake outreach initiatives from an FCC list of activities such as participation in job fairs, internships or scholarship programs. Stations must retain records of their outreach efforts and keep an annual Equal Employment Opportunity (“EEO”) report in their public inspection files and post an electronic version on their websites.  In April 2017, the FCC issued a Declaratory Ruling permitting broadcast stations to use online job postings as their sole means of recruiting, so long as online postings reach all segments of a broadcasters’ community.  
 Certain FCC rules affecting programming and operations are briefly summarized below. 
 Indecency and Profanity 
 Provisions of federal law regulate the broadcast of obscene, indecent, or profane material. The FCC’s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent or profane material because the vagueness of the FCC’s indecency/profanity definition makes it difficult to apply, particularly with regard to spontaneous, live programming. In recent years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts of these indecency and profanity regulations, and has threatened to initiate license revocation proceedings against broadcast licenses for “serious” indecency or profanity violations. The FCC has substantially increased its monetary penalties for violations of these regulations. Legislation enacted in 2006 provides the FCC with authority to impose fines of up to $407,270 per indecent or profane utterance with a maximum forfeiture exposure of $3,759,410 for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. In the ordinary course of business, we have received complaints or the FCC has initiated inquiries about whether a limited number of our radio stations have broadcast indecent programming.  The FCC inquiries with respect to indecency have been pending for several years and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. 
 In July 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (“Second Circuit”) issued a decision in which it vacated the FCC’s indecency policy as unconstitutional. In June 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision which held that the FCC could not fine ABC and FOX for the specific broadcasts at issue in the case because the FCC had not provided them with sufficient notice of its intent to issue fines for the use of fleeting expletives. The Court also held that the FCC’s indecency standards did not violate the First Amendment. In April 2013, the FCC requested comments on its indecency policy, including whether it should ban the use of fleeting expletives or whether it should only impose fines for broadcasts that involve repeated and deliberate use of expletives. The FCC has advised that it will continue to pursue enforcement actions in egregious cases while it conducts its review of its indecency policies generally and issued a Notice of Apparent Liability in 2015 for the then-maximum forfeiture amount of $325,000 against a television station for violation of its indecency policy. We cannot predict whether Congress will consider or adopt further legislation in this area. 
 Simulcasting 
 The FCC rules prohibit a licensee from simulcasting more than 25% of its programming on another radio station in the same broadcast service (that is, AM/AM or FM/FM). The simulcasting restriction applies if the licensee owns both radio broadcast stations or owns one and programs the other through a local marketing agreement, provided that the contours of the radio stations overlap in a certain manner. 
Time Brokerage and Joint Sales Agreements 
 Occasionally, stations enter into time brokerage agreements or local marketing agreements. Separately owned and licensed stations may agree to function cooperatively in programming, advertising sales and other matters, subject to compliance with the antitrust laws and the FCC’s rules and policies, including the requirement that the licensee of each station maintain independent control over the programming and other operations of its own station. Over the past few years, a number of stations have entered into cooperative arrangements commonly known as JSAs.  The FCC has determined that where two radio stations are both located in the same market and a party with a cognizable interest in one such station sells more than 15% of the advertising per week of the other station, that party shall be treated as if it has an attributable interest in that brokered station.   As noted in the Section entitled “Local Television Ownership,” above.   Television JSAs are currently not attributable. 
 23


RF Radiation 
 In 1985, the FCC adopted rules based on a 1982 American National Standards Institute, or “ANSI,” standard regarding human exposure to levels of radio frequency, or “RF,” radiation. These rules require applicants for renewal of broadcast licenses or modification of existing licenses to inform the FCC at the time of filing such applications whether an existing broadcast facility would expose people to RF radiation in excess of certain limits. In 1992, ANSI adopted a new standard for RF radiation exposure that, in some respects, was more restrictive in the amount of environmental RF radiation exposure permitted. The FCC has since adopted more restrictive radiation limits which became effective October 15, 1997 and which are based in part on the revised ANSI standard. 
 Terrestrial Digital Radio 
 The FCC has approved a technical standard for the provision of “in band, on channel” terrestrial digital radio broadcasting by existing radio broadcasters and has allowed radio broadcasters to convert to a hybrid mode of digital/analog operation on their existing frequencies. Digital radio provides additional spectrum segmentation for enhanced data services and additional program streams to complement the existing programming service, which permits new business and multicasting opportunities for radio broadcasters. In January 2010, the FCC adopted procedures that allow FM radio stations to significantly increase their digital power levels above those originally permitted in order to improve the digital service these stations provide. 
Low Power Radio Broadcast Service 
 The FCC has adopted rules establishing two classes of a low power radio service, both of which operate in the existing FM radio band: a primary class with a maximum operating power of 100 watts and a secondary class with a maximum power of 10 watts. These low power radio stations have limited service areas of 3.5 miles and 1 to 2 miles, respectively. Implementation of a low power radio service provides an additional audio programming service that could compete with our radio stations for listeners, but we cannot predict the effect upon us. 
Change of Community 
 The FCC has adopted rules concerning the FM Table of Allotments to allow radio broadcasters to change their community of license more easily. We have evaluated our current licenses to see if a community of license change would be beneficial. We are aware that competitors may use this rule revision to improve their facilities, and other radio operators may use this rule in a way that would make them newly attractive acquisition targets for us. 
Cable and Satellite Carriage of Television Broadcast Stations 
 The Communications Act and implementing FCC regulations govern the retransmission of commercial television stations by cable television systems and direct broadcast satellite, or “DBS,” operators. Every three years, each station must elect, with respect to cable systems and DBS operators within its designated market area, or “DMA,” either “must carry” status, pursuant to which the cable system’s or DBS operator’s carriage of the station is mandatory, or “retransmission consent,” pursuant to which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage in order to negotiate consideration in return for consenting to carriage. We have elected “must carry” with respect to our full power television stations, except in cases where the station is already carried pursuant to a retransmission consent or other affiliation agreement. These “must carry” rights are not absolute, and under some circumstances, a cable system or DBS operator may be entitled not to carry a given station. For example, DBS operators are required to carry the signals of all local television broadcast stations requesting carriage only in local markets in which the DBS operator carries at least one signal pursuant to the statutory local-to-local compulsory copyright license. 
 Neither cable systems nor DBS operators are required to carry more than a station’s primary video programming channel. Consequently, the multicast programming streams provided by our Houston television station are not entitled to mandatory carriage pursuant to the digital must-carry rules. In 2011, the FCC released a rulemaking seeking comment on a series of proposals to streamline and clarify the rules concerning retransmission consent negotiations.  This proceeding ended without the adoption of additional rules.   In a separate proceeding, the FCC has requested comment on whether the definition of MVPD should be expanded to include entities that make available multiple channels of video programming to subscribers through Internet connections. This proceeding remains pending. 
 24


Digital Television Services 
 As of June 12, 2009, all full-power broadcast television stations were required to cease broadcasting analog programming and convert to all digital broadcasts. The transition to digital television has improved the technical quality of television signals and provides broadcasters the flexibility to offer new services, including high-definition television, broadband data transmission and additional video streams. Our full-power television and Class A television stations have completed construction of their DTV facilities and are currently broadcasting solely on their digital channels. Our full-power television station in Houston also broadcasts several additional video streams and our Class A television station in Miami broadcasts one additional video stream. Under current FCC rules, when “must carry” rights apply, cable systems and DBS operators are required to carry only one channel of the digital signal of our television stations, despite the capability of digital broadcasters to broadcast multiple program streams within one station’s digital allotment. 
 To the extent a station has “excess” digital capacity (i.e., digital capacity not used to transmit free, over the air video programming), it may elect to use that capacity in any manner consistent with FCC technical requirements, including for data transmission, interactive or subscription video services, or paging and information services. If a station uses its digital capacity to provide any such “ancillary or supplementary” services on a subscription or otherwise “feeable” basis, it must pay the FCC an annual fee equal to 5% of the gross revenues realized from such services.
 In 2017, the FCC adopted rules authorizing the deployment of the Next Generation broadcast television transmission standard, also called ATSC 3.0. ATSC 3.0 is an Internet Protocol-based broadcast transmission platform that merges the capabilities of over-the-air broadcasting with the broadband viewing and information delivery methods of the Internet, using the same 6 MHz channels presently allocated for digital television service. Stations are not obligated to use ATSC 3.0; use of the new standard is voluntary. We cannot predict what impact the new standard will have on our business.
 Children’s Television Programming 
 The FCC has adopted rules on children’s television programming pursuant to the Children’s Television Act of 1990. The rules limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on television stations during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger and require stations to broadcast on their main program stream three hours per week of educational and informational programming (“E/I programming”) designed for children 16 years of age and younger. FCC rules also impose E/I programming requirements on each additional digital multicast program stream transmitted by television stations, with the requirement increasing in proportion to the additional hours of free programming offered on multicast channels. These rules also limit the display during children’s programming of Internet addresses of websites that contain or link to commercial material or that use program characters to sell products. In July 2018, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on revisions to the children’s television programming rules to modify outdated requirements and to give broadcasters greater flexibility in serving the educational and informational needs of children.   The notice remains pending.
Sponsorship Identification 
 Both the Communications Act and the FCC rules generally require that, when payment or other consideration has been received or promised to a broadcast licensee for the airing of program material, the station must disclose that fact and identify who paid or promised to provide the consideration at the time of the airing. In the past, the FCC has initiated inquiries against several media companies, including our company, concerning sponsorship identification practices with respect to the music recording industry. The FCC has also initiated inquiries against several dozen television stations seeking to determine whether their broadcast of “video news releases” (each, a “VNR”) violated the sponsorship identification rules by failing to disclose the source and sponsorship of the VNR materials. At least two television broadcast licensees were issued fines by the FCC for violations of the sponsorship ID rules related to VNRs. VNRs are news stories and feature materials produced by government agencies and commercial entities, among others, for use by broadcasters. The FCC also has a long-pending rule-making proceeding concerning sponsorship identification issues, such as product placement. Whether any new regulations are ultimately adopted and, if so, the effect of such rules on our operations cannot currently be determined. 
Closed Captioning and Video Description Rules 
 FCC rules require the majority of programming broadcast by television stations to contain closed captions. The rules allow a video programming owner to file a petition for exemption from the rules. We have filed a petition for exemption from the rules based upon a showing of undue burden. During the pendency of an undue burden determination, the video programming subject to the request for exemption is considered exempt from the closed captioning requirement. In January 2012, the FCC adopted rules to require that television programming broadcast or transmitted with captioning include captioning if subsequently made available online, for example, by streaming content on broadcasters’ websites. In 2014, the FCC adopted an Order expanding the IP captioning rules to brief segments or clips of video programs that are carried on the Internet.  The new rules will phase in between January 1, 2016 and July 1, 2017.  In 2016, the FCC adopted additional rules with respect to the provision and quality of closed captions.

FCC rules also require, in part, that affiliates of the top-four national broadcast networks in the top 60 markets provide a minimum of 50 hours of video-described primetime and/or children’s programming each calendar quarter. 
 Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation 
 Rules enacted by the FCC that require our television broadcast stations to transmit commercials and adjacent programming at the same volume went into effect in December 2012. 
Recordkeeping 
 The FCC rules require broadcast stations to maintain various records regarding operations, including equipment performance records and a log of a station’s operating parameters. Broadcast stations must also maintain a public inspection file on an FCC-maintained website.   This means that the materials in stations’ public inspection files are widely accessible.  
 Regulation of the Internet 
 Internet services including websites of our broadcast stations are subject to regulation relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13, including the federal Child Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (“CAN-SPAM”). In addition, a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations. Additional federal, state, territorial laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services, covering such issues as user privacy, child safety, data security, advertising, pricing, content, copyrights and trademarks, access by persons with disabilities, distribution, taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services. 
 Repurposing of Broadcast Spectrum for Other Uses by the FCC
 Federal legislation was enacted in February 2012 that, among other things, authorized the FCC to conduct voluntary “broadcast incentive auctions” in order to reallocate certain spectrum currently occupied by television broadcast stations to mobile wireless broadband services, to “repack” television stations into a smaller portion of the existing television spectrum band, and to require television stations that did not relinquish spectrum in the reverse auction to modify their transmission facilities, subject to reimbursement for reasonable relocation costs up to a nationwide total of $1.75 billion. 
 The FCC has adopted rules concerning the incentive auction and the repacking of the television band and concluded the broadcast incentive auction. Under the auction rules implemented by the FCC, television stations were given an opportunity to offer spectrum for sale to the government in a “reverse” auction while wireless providers could bid to acquire spectrum from the government in a related “forward” auction. We participated in the auction for stations in Miami, Houston, and multiple stations in Puerto Rico.  However, because the price to sell our spectrum fell below the value we ascribe to it, we only sold the spectrum of one television station in Puerto Rico in the auction.
 Following completion of the incentive auction, the FCC is now “repacking” the remaining television broadcast spectrum, which requires certain television stations that did not participate or were not selected in the reverse auction to modify their transmission facilities, including requiring such stations to operate on other channels. We have been notified by the FCC that our Miami, Houston, and one of our Puerto Rico TV Stations will have their channel designation reassigned. The original reimbursement limit across all stations nationwide was $1.75 billion.  However, in March 2018, Congress authorized an additional $1 billion to be used for reimbursements related to repacking and directed that of that amount not more than $50 million could be used to reimburse FM stations that share towers with television stations being repacked and that are required to modify their facilities on a temporary or permanent basis to accommodate changes made by the television stations.  In August, 2018, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to adopt procedures to reimburse FM stations as well as to low power television and television translator stations that will be displaced. As of the date of this Annual Report this notice remains pending.  
 We have filed cost estimates related to the repacking of our TV stations and our channel reassignments and are submitting invoices for reimbursement as they are received.  We are not aware that any of our FM stations will be impacted by facilities modifications unlike what our television stations being repacked will be required to implement.  When repacking, the FCC makes reasonable efforts to preserve a station’s coverage area and population served. In addition, the FCC is prohibited from requiring a station to move involuntarily from the UHF band, the band in which most of our television broadcast licenses operate, to the VHF band or from the high VHF band to the low VHF band. The impact of the repacking of our broadcast television spectrum on our business cannot be predicted at this time.

Laws Affecting Intellectual Property 
 Laws affecting intellectual property are of significant importance to us to protect our brands and copyrights. Protection of brands requires the vigilance and action by the brand owner. We seek trademark registrations for significant brand assets and enforce our brand rights against infringing parties through legal actions, including enforcement actions in the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  Unauthorized distribution or reproduction of content, especially in digital formats such as unlicensed live simultaneous or stored streaming of audio recordings and peer-to-peer file “sharing,” are threats to a copyright owner’s ability to protect and exploit its property. We monitor legal changes that might impact the exclusive rights we have in broadcasts, streams and recorded content. Our digital delivery services and commercial arrangements with digital content providers help reduce the risks associated with unauthorized access to our content. We are also engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property.Proposed and Recent Changes 
 Congress and the FCC continually consider new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect our operations, ownership and profitability; result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenue; or affect our ability to acquire additional broadcast stations or to finance such acquisitions.
