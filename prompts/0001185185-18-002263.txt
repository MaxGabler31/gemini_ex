ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Overview and History
 
Fuse Enterprises Inc. (the “Company” or “Enterprises” or “We”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 24, 2013.  Enterprises is currently a full service online marketing agency, but is exploring opportunities in the mining industry. On December 6, 2016, the Company incorporated Fuse Processing, Inc. (“Processing”) in the State of California. Processing seeks business opportunities in the mining industry and is currently investigating potential mining targets in Asia and North America.  Enterprises is the sole shareholder of Processing.  On November 28, 2016, 5,500,000 shares of the common stock of Enterprises, or 60.91% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, were sold by Pavel Mikhalkov and Aleksandr Kriukov in a series of private transactions to a new shareholder for an aggregate purchase price of $55,000 (collectively, the “Stock Sales”). In connection with the Stock Sales, Messrs. Mikhalkov and Kriukov released the Company from certain liabilities and obligations arising out of their service as directors and officers of the Company. In March 2017, Processing acquired 100% ownership of Fuse Trading Limited (“Trading”) for HKD1 (US$0.13). Trading had no operations prior to the acquisition by Processing, and Trading expects to be engaged in mining-related businesses. On May 26, 2017, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the State of Nevada to (i) increase its authorized shares of common stock from 75,000,000 to 375,000,000 and (ii) effect a corresponding 5-for-1 forward stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Stock Split”).
