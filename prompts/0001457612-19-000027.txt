Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company that seeks to discover and develop novel cancer immunotherapies. We use our proprietary discovery platform, ATLAS, to profile CD4+ and CD8+ T cell (or cellular) immune responses to tumor antigens. We use insights arising from ATLAS to design novel cancer immunotherapies. We believe that ATLAS, which recreates each individual's T cell immune responses to their tumor in the laboratory, affords Genocea advantages in the design of novel cancer immunotherapies relative to our peers, who we believe rely primarily on software and processes such as "machine learning" to predict immunotherapy targets. Our most advanced program is GEN-009, a neoantigen (or personalized) cancer vaccine, for which we are conducting a Phase 1/2a clinical trial. The GEN-009 program uses ATLAS to identify neoantigens, or tumor mutations unique to each patient, for inclusion in each patient's GEN-009 vaccine. We are also advancing GEN-011, a neoantigen adoptive T cell therapy program as well as GEN-010, a next-generation neoantigen vaccine program.
ATLAS Platform
 Harnessing and directing the T cell arm of the immune system to kill tumor cells is increasingly viewed as having potential in the treatment of many cancers, and this approach has clearly shown efficacy in hematologic malignancies. Treatments arising from this approach must target specific differences present in a tumor, such as genetic mutations. However, the discovery of such T cell targets, or antigens, has been particularly challenging for two reasons. First, the diversity of human T cell responses means that an effective T cell target for one person may be different from an effective T cell target for another person. Second, the number of candidate targets for T cell responses can be very large with up to thousands of candidate antigens per patient in some cancers. These complexities represent fundamental barriers that traditional cancer immunotherapy target discovery tools, which rely largely on computer modeling - so-called predictive algorithms - have, as yet, only poorly addressed. We have designed the ATLAS platform to overcome these T cell target discovery challenges. We believe that ATLAS represents the most comprehensive and accurate high-throughput system for T cell immune response profiling in the biopharmaceutical industry. ATLAS is designed to mimic the T cell arm of the human immune system of each patient that it profiles in a laboratory setting. Using ATLAS, we are able to measure T cell responses to the entire set of potential T cell targets for an individual’s cancer. Using ATLAS, we can determine if these T cell responses are statistically above or below a baseline measurement and can develop immunotherapies using only those targets and T cells determined to be most likely to kill an individual’s cancer. We believe that we are a leader in the field of T cell-related immunotherapy discovery and development. Our management and scientific teams possess considerable experience in oncology, immunology, and vaccinology spanning research, manufacturing, clinical development and regulatory affairs.

Our Programs
Our cancer immunotherapies are designed to educate T cells to recognize and attack specific targets - or to introduce T cells already educated to attack these targets - and thereby kill cancer cells. We are first developing personalized cancer vaccines by applying ATLAS to identify patient neoantigens that are associated with that individual's pre-existing immune responses to a tumor.    Neoantigens are personalized tumor mutations that are seen as “foreign” by an individual’s immune system. Data published in recent years have indicated that an individual’s response to neoantigens drives immune checkpoint inhibitor ("ICI") efficacy and that it is possible to vaccinate an individual against their own neoantigens. If approved, neoantigen vaccines could be used in combination with existing treatment approaches for cancer, including ICIs, to potentially direct and enhance an individual’s T cell response to the individual’s cancer, thereby potentially effecting better clinical outcomes. Data also support the potential of isolating and expanding T cell populations targeting specific neoantigens for therapeutic benefit.

    Our lead immuno-oncology program, GEN-009, is an adjuvanted neoantigen peptide vaccine candidate designed to direct a patient’s immune system to attack their tumor. GEN-009’s neoantigens are identified by our proprietary ATLAS platform, which is designed to profile CD4+ and CD8+ cell immune responses to tumor antigens. Following ATLAS neoantigen identification, we manufacture a personalized vaccine for each patient using only those neoantigens determined to be stimulatory to the immune system by ATLAS.    In June 2018, we initiated a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for GEN-009 in a range of tumor types in subjects with no evidence of disease but at high risk of relapse. In January 2019, we announced that we had commenced dosing patients and completed enrollment in this first part of the trial. We expect to report immunogenicity results from the initial patient cohort late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter of 2019.    
 We have also initiated pre-clinical work on GEN-011, an adoptive T cell therapy to neoantigens identified by ATLAS. We currently expect to file an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for GEN-011 in the first half of 2020. Behind GEN-009, we also continue to explore GEN-010, our vaccine candidate employing next-generation antigen delivery technology, which could provide an opportunity for even better immunogenicity and/or efficiency of production. We are also using ATLAS to amass libraries of novel candidate antigens for non-personalized cancer immunotherapies. Such programs would target non-mutated, shared tumor-associated antigens and cancers of viral origin. For shared antigens, we have had and continue to conduct a number of research collaborations that provide blood and tumor samples to antigen discovery and immune-response profiling as follows:

• | Dana Farber Cancer Institute (ongoing), Mayo Clinic (completed), and Checkmate Pharmaceuticals (completed)

The Company is not dependent on these research collaborations to develop its product candidates and no material financial obligations exist as part of these collaborations.
For cancers of viral origin, we have profiled the immune responses that several cohorts of patients made to Epstein-Barr Virus ("EBV"). EBV infection has been linked to cancers with high unmet needs such as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma. We believe that ATLAS is highly suited to the creation of a new immunotherapy for EBV given that T cell responses are understood to be crucial for protection against EBV. Furthermore, EBV is part of the herpes virus family in which we have deep experience through our previous development of GEN-003. 
Our Immuno-oncology Product Candidate Pipeline
The following table describes our active programs in development:

Vaccine Candidate | Program | Stage of Development | Next Milestone | Anticipated Timeline 
GEN-009 | First generation neoantigen cancer vaccine | Phase 1/2a | Immunogenicity data from the first patient cohort | Late Q2/early Q3 2019
GEN-010 | Second generation neoantigen cancer vaccine | Pre-clinical | Select delivery technology platform | Ongoing 
GEN-011 | Adoptive T cell therapy | Pre-clinical | IND filing | First half of 2020 

 In addition to our immuno-oncology programs, we also have an investigational immunotherapy for the treatment of genital herpes, GEN-003. To date, GEN-003 has completed three positive clinical trials. However, we have ceased substantially all activities under the GEN-003 program and are exploring alternatives to maximize shareholder value from GEN-003.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. Although we believe that our proprietary patent portfolio and T cell 
5

vaccine expertise provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical companies. Not only must we compete with other vaccine companies but any products that we may commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.

There are other organizations working to improve existing therapies or to develop new vaccines or therapies for our initially selected indications. Depending on how successful these efforts are, it is possible they may increase the barriers to adoption and success of our product candidates, including GEN-009, if approved. 
There are several companies attempting to develop new neoantigen cancer vaccines, including Advaxis Inc., Agenus Inc., BioNTech AG., CureVac AG., Gritstone Oncology Inc., Moderna Inc., and Neon Therapeutics Inc. We believe that GEN-009 has advantages against each of these product candidates based on the potential power of the ATLAS platform to comprehensively identify for each cancer patient the neoantigens to which such patient has a pre-existing immune response. We believe that selecting neoantigens for personal cancer vaccines using ATLAS will lead to more effective vaccines. However, there can be no assurance that one or more of these companies or other companies will not achieve similar or superior clinical results in the future as compared to GEN-009 or that our future clinical trials will be successful.
Similarly, there are other companies attempting to develop cellular therapies targeted towards neoantigens, either through transferring T cells that have been transduced with T-cell Receptors ("TCR") that recognize tumor antigens, or T cells that have been enriched from tumors in a non-specific way (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes), or T cells from the peripheral blood that have been expanded on multiple tumor-specific antigens. These include Achilles Therapeutics Ltd., Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp., BioNTech AG., Bluebird Bio Inc., Cellular Biomedicine Group Inc., Eutilex Co., Ltd., Iovance Biotherapeutics Inc., Kite Pharma, Inc., Neon Therapeutics Inc., Oncotherapy Science Inc., PACT Pharma Inc., and Ziopharm Oncology Inc. We believe that Genocea’s ATLAS true neoantigen selection will lead to better targeted and more effective cell therapy; however, there can be no assurance that one or more of these companies, or other companies, will not achieve similar or superior clinical results in the future as compared to GEN-011, or that our future clinical trials will be successful.
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA, and other regulatory approvals of vaccines and the commercialization of those vaccines. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for vaccines and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ vaccines may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any vaccine we may commercialize and may render our vaccines obsolete or non-competitive.
Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any vaccines that we develop and commercialize to compete based on, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our products, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the vaccine and cell therapy fields. We additionally rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market 
6

exclusivity, and patent term extensions where available. Still further, we utilize trademark protection for our company name, and expect to do so for products and/or services as they are marketed.
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.
We have developed or in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of vaccine and cell therapy products. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("U.S. PTO") in granting a patent, or may be shortened, if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.
The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a United States patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a biologics license application ("BLA"), we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.
As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our patent portfolio includes the following:
ATLAS
Our discovery platform patent portfolio includes three patent families, currently comprising five issued U.S. patents. We hold an exclusive license from President and Fellows of Harvard College ("Harvard") to the first patent family, which covers methods related to the ATLAS discovery platform, including discovery of antigens expressed in neoplastic cells. This first patent family includes U.S. Patents 9,051,564 and 9,920,314, a pending U.S. application, issued patents in Europe, Canada, and Australia, and pending applications in Europe and Canada.

We wholly own the third patent family, which is directed to methods for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and patient selection, as well as related compositions. This third family currently comprises a pending PCT application and a pending U.S. application. We wholly own three further potential patent families, currently comprising six provisional applications filed in late 2018 and early 2019. The provisional applications are directed to ATLAS-based methods for further selection of cancer- or tumor-related antigens, and for redirecting immune responses.
GEN-003 (Genital Herpes)
We wholly own a portfolio of patent applications directed to herpes simplex virus-2, or HSV-2, vaccines, including GEN-003. This portfolio includes two patent families covering HSV-2 vaccine compositions and methods for inhibiting or treating HSV-2 infections, and combination treatment with antiviral medications. The first patent family includes U.S. Patents 
7

8,617,564 and 9,895,436, a pending U.S. application, and patents granted in Australia, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, and South Africa. Applications in Europe, Canada, Brazil, India, China and Hong Kong are pending in the first patent family. Patents that issue from applications in the first family are expected to expire in 2030. The term for U.S. Patent 8,617,564 includes Patent Term Adjustment and extends until at least November 2030. U.S. Patent 9,895,436 has a term that extends until May 2030. The second family includes a pending PCT application and a pending U.S. application. Patents that issue from applications in this family are expected to expire in 2037.
We own two further patent families covering follow-on HSV-2 vaccine compositions. The first family includes U.S. Patent 9,782,474, with a term that extends until 2031. The second family includes U.S. Patent 9,624,273, patents granted in Australia and Japan, and pending applications in Europe and Canada. U.S. Patent 9,624,273 has a term that extends until 2032; further patents that issue from applications in this family are expected to expire in 2032.
We hold a license from Isconova AB (now Novavax, Inc.) to two patent families covering Matrix-M2, the adjuvant used in GEN-003. The first patent family includes a pending U.S. application and issued patents in Europe, Canada, Australia, Japan, Brazil, New Zealand and South Africa. The second patent family includes U.S. Patent 8,821,881 and issued patents in Europe, Canada, Australia, Japan, Brazil, New Zealand and South Africa. These issued patents have patent terms until at least July 2023 and July 2024. The issued U.S. patent in the second patent family, U.S. Patent 8,821,881, has a term that extends until August 2026 inclusive of Patent Term Adjustment.
In addition to the above, we have established expertise and development capabilities focused in the areas of preclinical research and development, manufacturing and manufacturing process scale-up, quality control, quality assurance, regulatory affairs and clinical trial design and implementation. We believe that our focus and expertise will help us develop products based on our proprietary intellectual property.
In-License Agreements
Harvard University
In November 2007, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Harvard University, granting us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license to three patent families, to develop, make, have made, use, market, offer for sale, sell, have sold and import licensed products and to perform licensed services. This agreement was amended and restated in November 2012. The Harvard University intellectual property covers methods related to the ATLAS discovery platform, including discovery of antigens expressed in neoplastic cells, as well as certain chlamydia immunogenic compositions and methods for inhibiting or treating chlamydia infections. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may be issued will expire normally in 2027 and 2028. Harvard University retains the right to make and use, and to grant licenses to other not-for-profit research organizations to make and use, the licensed intellectual property for internal research, teaching and other educational purposes. We notified Harvard University of our partial termination of the license agreement with regard to intellectual property covering chlamydia antigens on December 8, 2014. Effective March 8, 2015, the license agreement with Harvard, regarding intellectual property covering chlamydia antigens, was terminated and we no longer hold a license to two of the three in-licensed Harvard patent families, or to a chlamydia antigen covered by the remaining family. The remaining family covers certain aspects of the ATLAS platform, as well as one chlamydia antigen, and we continue to maintain exclusive rights to certain aspects of the ATLAS platform covered by this family.
We are obligated to pay Harvard University an annual license maintenance fee ranging from the low five figures to the mid-five figures depending on the type of product and the number of years after the effective date of the agreement. For products covered by the licensed patent rights, we are obligated to pay Harvard milestone payments up to $1.8 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. For products discovered using the licensed methods, we are obligated to pay Harvard milestone payments up to $600 thousand in the aggregate for each of the first three products and up to $300 thousand in the aggregate for each additional product under the agreement upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. As of December 31, 2018, we incurred $231 thousand in aggregate milestone payments. 
Upon commercialization of our products covered by the licensed patent rights or discovered using the licensed methods, we are obligated to pay Harvard royalties on the net sales of such products and services sold by us, our affiliates, and our sublicensees. This royalty varies depending on the type of product or service but is in the low single digits. The sales-based royalty due by our sublicensees is the greater of the applicable royalty rate or a percentage in the high single digits or the low double digits of the royalties we receive from such sublicensee, depending on the type of product. Based on the type of commercialized product or service, royalties are payable until the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim under the licensed 
8

patent rights or for a period of 10 years from first commercial sale of such product or service. The royalties payable to Harvard University are subject to reduction, capped at a specified percentage, for any third-party payments required to be made. In addition to the royalty payments, if we receive any additional revenue (cash or non-cash) under any sublicense, we must pay Harvard a percentage of such revenue, excluding certain categories of payments, varying from the low single digits to up to the low double digits depending on the scope of the license that includes the sublicense.
We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products, introduce them into the commercial market, and market them in compliance with an agreed upon development plan. We are also obligated to achieve specified development milestones. If we are unable to meet our development milestones for any type of product or service, absent any reasonable proposed extension or amendment thereof, Harvard has the right, depending on the type of product or service, to terminate this agreement with respect to such products or to convert the license to a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license with respect to such products and services.
Our agreement with Harvard University will expire on a product-by-product or service-by-service and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim under the licensed patent rights. We may terminate the agreement at any time by giving Harvard advance written notice. Harvard may also terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach by us that remains uncured; in the event of our insolvency, bankruptcy, or similar circumstances; or if we challenge the validity of any patents licensed to us.
Manufacture Contracts 
Oncovir
In January 2018, we entered into a License and Supply Agreement with Oncovir, Inc. (“Oncovir”). The agreement provides the terms and conditions under which Oncovir will manufacture and supply an immunomodulator and vaccine adjuvant, Hiltonol® (poly-ICLC) (“Hiltonol”), to us for use in connection with the research, development, use, sale, manufacture, commercialization and marketing of products combining Hiltonol with our technology (the “Combination Product”). Hiltonol is the adjuvant component of GEN-009, which will consist of synthetic long peptides or neoantigens identified using our proprietary ATLAS platform, formulated with Hiltonol. When paired with synthetic long peptides, Hiltonol has shown the ability to induce T cell responses, which we believe will be important for driving the clinical efficacy of GEN-009. Hiltonol is manufactured under good manufacturing practice ("GMP") conditions, has an existing drug master file, and has an extensive tolerability record when used alone and in combination with vaccine antigens. We are not required to purchase any minimum quantity of Hiltonol from Oncovir. 
Oncovir granted us a non-exclusive, assignable, royalty-bearing worldwide license, with the right to grant sublicenses through one tier, to certain of Oncovir’s intellectual property in connection with the research, development, or commercialization of Combination Products, including the use of Hiltonol, but not the use of Hiltonol for manufacturing or the use or sale of Hiltonol alone. The license shall become perpetual, fully paid-up, and royalty-free on the later of January 25, 2028 or the date on which the last valid claim of any patent licensed to us under the agreement expires.
Under this agreement, we are obligated to pay Oncovir (i) an up-front payment in the mid-six figures in consideration of the license granted to us and for the initial supply of Hiltonol for the GEN-009 Phase 1/2 trial, (ii) a supply price for Hiltonol in the low-three figures per vial of Hiltonol for use in clinical trials or commercial use, (iii) a milestone payment in the low-six figures upon the achievement of certain clinical trial milestones for each Combination Product, (iv) a milestone payment in the mid-six figures upon the first marketing approval for each Combination Product in certain territories, and (v) tiered royalties in the low-single digits on a product-by-product basis based on the net sales of Combination Products. 
We may terminate the agreement upon a decision to discontinue the development of the Combination Product or upon a determination by us or an applicable regulatory authority that Hiltonol or a Combination Product is not clinically safe or effective. The agreement may also be terminated by either party due to a material uncured breach by the other party, or due to the other party’s bankruptcy, insolvency, or dissolution.
Trade Secrets
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or 
9

security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors, or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Government Regulation
Biological products such as vaccines and adaptive cell therapies are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FD&C Act") and the Public Health Service Act ("PHS Act"), and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C and PHS Acts and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. Clinical testing of biological products is subject to FDA review before initiation. In addition, FDA approval must be obtained before marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory review and approval and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.
United States Biological Products Development Process
The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following process:

• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices ("GLP") and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices ("GCP") and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use, including approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with GMPs to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices ("GTP") for the use of human cellular and tissue products;


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.

Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical study stage. Preclinical studies, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical studies must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical studies may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.
10

Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events ("AEs") should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 


• | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible AEs and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 


• | Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate safety, purity, and potential of biological product in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval and product labeling. 

Post-approval clinical studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected AEs, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Sponsors of all controlled clinical trials, except for Phase 1 trials, are required to submit certain clinical trial information for inclusion in the public clinical trial registry and results data bank maintained by the National Institutes of Health, which are publicly available at http://clinicaltrials.gov. 
Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be 
11

selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
United States Review and Approval Processes
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all, and for what indications will be approved, if any.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA"), as re-authorized for an additional five years in 2017, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. PDUFA also imposes annual product fees based on each approved biologic. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with GMP regulations to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS"), is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure GMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
12

One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months from filing and 90% of priority BLAs in six months from filing, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
United States Fraud and Abuse, Transparency and Privacy Laws
In the United States, our business activities are subject to numerous other federal, state and local laws designed to prevent fraud and abuse, promote transparency in interactions with others in the healthcare industry or protect the privacy of individual information. These laws are enforced by various federal and state enforcement authorities, including but not limited to, the United States Department of Justice, and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, the United States Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"), HHS’ various divisions, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS"), the Office of Inspector General, the Office for Human Research Protections, and the Office of Research Integrity, and other state and local government agencies.
Although we currently have no products approved for commercial sale, we may be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws, for activities related to future sales of any of our product candidates that may in the future receive regulatory and marketing approval. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a pharmaceutical manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase, prescription or use of a particular drug. False claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for reimbursed drugs or services to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under such laws.
Laws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers with marketed products. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers and/or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, any future activities (if we obtain approval and/or reimbursement from federal healthcare programs for our product candidates) could be subject to challenge.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above, or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Reimbursement
In both domestic and foreign markets, the commercial success of any approved products will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement for such products from third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance, and managed care organizations. Patients who are provided vaccinations, and providers providing vaccinations, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated health care costs. Sales of any approved vaccines will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our approved vaccines will be paid by third-party payors. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. The containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. In addition, there is significant uncertainty regarding the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. If third-party payors do not consider 
13

our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, the payors may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
Within the United States, if we obtain appropriate approval in the future to market any of our current product candidates, we may seek coverage for those products under Medicaid, Medicare, and the 340B drug pricing programs. These programs are administered by various federal and state agencies and provide prescription drug benefits to individuals who are age 65 and over, low income, or disabled or allow healthcare providers that serve vulnerable populations to purchase prescription drugs at discounted prices. In the future, we may also seek to sell any approved product candidates to government purchasers. In order to obtain coverage for our products under government benefit programs, or to sell products to government purchasers, we may be required to track and report prices for our products, offer discounts to certain purchasers, or pay rebates on certain utilization. 
In the United States, federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, health care, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the "Healthcare Reform Act") which expanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage and which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs. Under the Trump administration, there have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminates the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019 (the so-called “individual mandate”). In a May 2018 report, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that, compared to 2018, the number of uninsured will increase by 3 million in 2019 and 6 million in 2028, in part due to the elimination of the individual mandate. The Healthcare Reform Act has also been subject to judicial challenge. In December 2018, a federal district court judge, in a challenge brought by a number of state attorneys general, found the Healthcare Reform Act unconstitutional in its entirety because, once Congress repealed the individual mandate provision, there was no longer a basis to rely on Congressional taxing authority to support enactment of the law. Pending appeals, which could take some time, the Healthcare Reform Act is still operational in all respects. 
There have been other reform initiatives under the Trump Administration, including initiatives focused on drug pricing. For example, in May of 2018, President Trump and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services released a “blueprint” to lower prescription drug prices and out-of-pocket costs. Certain proposals in the blueprint, and related drug pricing measures proposed since the blueprint, could cause significant operational and reimbursement changes for the pharmaceutical industry. As another example, in November of 2018, CMS issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that proposed revisions to Medicare Part D to support health plans’ negotiation of lower drug prices with manufacturers and reduce health plan member’s out-of-pocket costs. The HHS Office of Inspector General issued a proposed rule in February of 2018 that would revise the federal anti-kickback statute to limit protection for discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”), Medicare Part D plans, and Medicaid managed care plans that are not reflected in the price charged to the patient at the pharmacy counter and to provide protection only for certain types of service fees paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers to PBMs.
There have also been other efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices.
Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our product candidates if approved for sale. We cannot, however, predict the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any changes to the Healthcare Reform Act or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results.
Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our products will face challenges. In international markets, reimbursement and health care payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. Third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly-approved health care products. Recent budgetary 
14

pressures in many European Union countries are also causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application ("CTA") much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company intends to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed in that country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs and other applicable regulatory requirements.
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more “concerned” member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one-member state, known as the “reference” member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. In light of the United Kingdom’s vote in 2016 to leave the European Union, the so-called Brexit vote, there may be changes forthcoming in the scope of the centralized approval procedure as the terms of that exit are negotiated between the United Kingdom and the European Union.
Manufacturing
We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for non-clinical studies and clinical trials, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval.
