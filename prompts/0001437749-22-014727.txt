We are a leading branded licensor, wholesaler and retailer of products marketed under our Nathan’s Famous brand, including our popular Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs. What began as a nickel hot dog stand on Coney Island in 1916 has evolved into a highly recognized brand throughout the United States and the world. Our innovative business model seeks to maximize the points of distribution for and the consumption of Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries and our other products across a wide-range of grocery retail and foodservice formats. Our products are currently marketed for sale in approximately 79,000 locations, including supermarkets, mass merchandisers and club stores, selected foodservice locations and our Company-owned and franchised restaurants throughout the United States and in seventeen foreign countries. The Company considers itself to be in the foodservice industry and has pursued co-branding initiatives within other foodservice environments. Our major channels of distribution are as follows:
 

● | Our licensing program contracts with certain third parties to manufacture, distribute, market and sell a broad variety of Nathan’s Famous branded products including our hot dogs, sausage and corned beef products, frozen crinkle-cut French fries and additional products through retail grocery channels and club stores throughout the United States. As of March 27, 2022, packaged Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs continued to be sold in supermarkets, mass merchandisers and club stores including Walmart, Kroger, Ahold, Publix, Albertsons, Safeway, ShopRite, Target, Sam’s Club, Costco and BJ’s Wholesale Club located in all 50 states. We earn revenue through royalties on products sold by our licensees.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Branded Product Program (“BPP”) provides foodservice operators in a variety of venues the opportunity to capitalize on our Nathan’s Famous brand by marketing and selling certain Nathan’s Famous hot dog products. We believe that the program has broad appeal to foodservice operators due to its flexibility to deliver our products to a wide variety of distribution channels. In conjunction with the program, operators are granted a limited use of the Nathan’s Famous trademark, as well as Nathan’s point of purchase materials. Unlike our licensing and franchise programs, we do not generate revenue from royalties, but rather by selling our hot dog products either directly to foodservice operators or to various foodservice distributors who resell the products to foodservice operators.

● | Operating quick-service restaurants featuring Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries, and a variety of other menu offerings, which operate under the name “Nathan’s Famous,” the name first used at our original Coney Island restaurant which opened in 1916.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our franchised restaurant operations are comprised predominately of our Nathan’s Famous concept, which features a menu consisting of Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries and beverages as well as other items. In fiscal 2021, we opened our first virtual kitchens (existing kitchens with no Nathan’s Famous branded store front presence, used to fill online orders). We earn royalties on sales at these franchise locations and virtual kitchens. In addition to our traditional franchised restaurants and virtual kitchens, we enable approved foodservice operators to offer a Nathan’s Famous menu of Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries, proprietary toppings and a limited menu of other Nathan’s products through our Branded Menu Program (“BMP”). We earn royalties on Nathan’s products purchased by our BMP franchise operators.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We also own, through our subsidiary NF Treacher’s Corp., the Arthur Treacher’s brand and trademarks. We use the Arthur Treacher’s brand, products and trademarks as a branded seafood menu-line extension for inclusion in certain Nathan’s Famous restaurants, as well as virtual kitchens. Currently, there are seven Arthur Treacher’s BMP locations.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that we benefit from the following competitive strengths:
 
Iconic Brand with Global Recognition 
 
For over 100 years, we have cultivated Nathan’s Famous into an iconic brand with global recognition. From our authentic origins on Coney Island to our popular Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, the Nathan’s Famous brand has become synonymous with premium hot dogs enjoyed throughout the year including cookouts, and July 4th celebrations. Over time, we have continued expanding the number and types of points of distribution for Nathan’s Famous products by leveraging our highly recognizable brand.
 
The Frank of Choice 
 
Since our beginnings as a nickel hot dog stand in 1916, we have focused on creating the best premium hot dog. Using premium cuts of meat, our proprietary spice mix and based on a recipe originally developed in 1916, our hot dogs have a unique flavor and texture that consumers are drawn to.
 
Our hot dogs have received numerous awards and recognition from critics and reviewers.
 
Recognition as an award-winning hot dog has strengthened our brand and created a devoted fan base. We believe that our high brand awareness allows us to sell hot dogs at a premium price to competing brands across all channels of distribution.
 
Multi-channel business model provides diversified revenue streams 
 
We believe that our flexible business model enables us to diversify across multiple channels of distribution and customers. Our products are distributed through supermarkets, mass merchandisers, club stores, Company-owned restaurants, franchised restaurants, virtual kitchens, food service distributors and other food service operators such as gas stations, movie theaters and sporting venues. We believe that there is potential to increase our sales by converting sales of non-branded products throughout the foodservice industry.
 
High margin licensing revenue streams
 
We earn stable and high-margin revenue through multiple licensing programs. Through licensing programs with such companies as John Morrell & Co., a subsidiary of Smithfield Foods, Inc., and Lamb Weston, Inc., over twenty Nathan’s Famous branded SKUs are sold through grocery retail channels. All of our licensing agreements combined produced $31,824,000 and $31,368,000 of high margin revenue for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Our Business Strategies
 
Our primary focus has been to expand the market penetration of the Nathan’s Famous brand. Specifically, we have sought to increase the number of points of brand representation and grow product sales throughout our various channels of distribution. In this regard, we have concentrated our efforts on:

● | expanding our licensing programs for packaged Nathan’s Famous products through new product introductions and geographic expansion;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expanding our portfolio of foodservice venues and properties participating in the Nathan’s Famous Branded Product Program;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expanding the number of domestic franchised Nathan’s Famous restaurant units through the opening of new and innovative types of locations, including the Branded Menu Program, as well as continuing to develop master franchising programs in foreign countries;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expanding the number of virtual kitchens domestically and internationally helping to grow our Nathan’s Famous brand and Wings of New York concept; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | continuing to operate our iconic Company-owned restaurants, and opportunistically seeking to invest in Company-owned restaurant expansion.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of March 27, 2022:
 

● | our Nathan’s Famous Company-owned and franchised units in operation consisted of 239 franchised units and four Company-owned units (including one seasonal unit) located in 18 states and twelve foreign countries;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our virtual kitchens in operation consisted of 287 units located in 20 states and 6 foreign countries;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our Nathan’s Famous Branded Product Program featured our Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs throughout all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Canada, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and Mexico;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nathan’s Famous packaged hot dogs and other products were offered for sale in supermarkets, mass merchandisers and club stores in all 50 states.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our revenues are generated primarily from sales of products sold through our Branded Product Program and within our Company-owned restaurants, as well as royalties from our retail licensing activities and the royalties, fees and other sums we earn from our restaurant franchising activities.
 
COVID-19 Pandemic 
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”), a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a significant impact on our business and results of operations. During the peak of the pandemic in 2020 and during subsequent resurgences of the virus, governmental restrictions and public perceptions of the risks associated with COVID-19 caused consumers to avoid or limit non-essential travel, gatherings in public places and others social interactions. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact traffic at our Company-owned restaurants and franchised restaurants, as well as sales to our Branded Product Program customers and royalties from our retail licensing activities.
 
Our restaurant operations have been and could continue to be disrupted by COVID-19 related employee absences or due to changes in the availability and cost of labor. Our ability to attract and to retain employees at our Company-owned restaurants remains challenged, as the job market for these employees remains tight and has become more competitive.
 
    6 

  

The challenges in the labor market have also affected some suppliers, resulting in some intermittent product shortages. We remain in regular contact with our major suppliers and to date we have not experienced significant disruptions in our supply chain; however, we have experienced inflationary pressures in freight and some of our commodity costs, including beef and beef trimmings, and paper costs which have impacted both our restaurant operations and our Branded Product Program.
 
We continue to monitor the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business; however, due to the continuous development and fluidity of this pandemic and resurgences of new variants of the virus we cannot determine the ultimate impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and liquidity is discussed in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.
 
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in Delaware on July 10, 1992 under the name “Nathan’s Famous Holding Corporation” to act as the parent of a Delaware corporation then-known as Nathan’s Famous, Inc. On December 15, 1992, we changed our name to Nathan’s Famous, Inc., and our Delaware subsidiary changed its name to Nathan’s Famous Operating Corp. The Delaware subsidiary was organized in October 1989 in connection with its re-incorporation in Delaware from that of a New York corporation named “Nathan’s Famous, Inc.” The New York Nathan’s was incorporated on July 10, 1925, as a successor to the sole-proprietorship that opened the first Nathan’s restaurant in Coney Island in 1916. On July 23, 1987, Equicor Group, Ltd. merged with and into the New York Nathan’s in a “going private” transaction. The New York Nathan’s, the Delaware subsidiary and Equicor may all be deemed to be our predecessors.
Restaurant Operations
 
Our restaurant operations and results were significantly impacted by COVID-19 beginning in March 2020 and impacted the results of our operations in fiscal 2021 and continued during fiscal 2022. As COVID-19 spread throughout the United States, governmental authorities implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These governmental restrictions and public perceptions of the risks associated with COVID-19 have caused consumers to avoid or limit nonessential travel, gatherings in public places and other social interactions, which has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our restaurant operations. As a result of COVID-19, we and our franchisees have experienced reductions in customer traffic at our locations. Additionally, our Company-owned restaurants and our franchised restaurants have also experienced interruptions of some food and other supplies as well as labor shortages that have negatively impacted restaurant operations.
 
Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, our four Company-owned restaurants remained open throughout the fiscal 2022 period. Our seasonal location on the Coney Island Boardwalk was open from April 2, 2021 to October 11, 2021. It reopened for the fiscal 2023 summer season on April 1, 2022.
 
A majority of our franchised locations closed temporarily during the fiscal 2021 period due to their locations being in venues that were closed (such as movie theaters) or venues operating at reduced traffic levels (such as airports, highway travel plazas, and shopping malls). During the fiscal 2022 period, the number of COVID-19 cases stabilized with approved vaccines being more widely distributed and administered and, as result, more regions loosened restrictions, adhering to state and local guidelines. Currently, approximately 97% of the Company’s franchise system is open (excluding 27 BMP locations in Ukraine which are temporarily closed as a result of the Russia – Ukraine conflict). We believe that the impact of these temporary closures is not likely to significantly affect our restaurant operations.
 
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to focus on digital initiatives to enhance the customer experience; to increase customer traffic; and to promote off-premise capabilities.
 
We remain principally focused on the well-being and safety of our guests, restaurant employees, franchisees, and all other Corporate employees.
 
  7 



The health and well-being of our employees and guests has always been and continues to be our top priority. Since there continues to be uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic, as variants continue to emerge, we may implement additional safety measures in line with health authority recommendations and regulatory requirements.
 
Nathan’s Famous Concept and Menus 
 
Our Nathan’s Famous concept is scalable, offering a wide range of facility designs and sizes, suitable to a vast variety of locations, featuring a core menu consisting of Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries and beverages. Nathan’s menu is designed to take advantage of site-specific market opportunities by adding complementary food items to the core menu. The Nathan’s concept is suitable to stand-alone or can be co-branded with other nationally recognized brands.
 
Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs are flavored with our secret blend of spices provided by Ida Handwerker in 1916, which historically have distinguished Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs. Our hot dogs are prepared and served in accordance with procedures which have not varied significantly since our inception over 100 years ago in our Company-owned and franchised restaurants. Our signature crinkle-cut French fries, cooked in 100% trans-fat-free corn oil, are featured at each Nathan’s restaurant. We believe the majority of sales in our Company-owned restaurants consist of Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries and beverages.
 
Individual Nathan’s restaurants supplement their core menu of Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries and beverages with a variety of other quality menu choices including: the Nathan’s Famous NY Cheesesteak by Pat LaFreida, our fresh angus hamburger program and our hand-dipped chicken program. We have historically used the Arthur Treacher’s brand, products and trademarks as a branded seafood menu-line extension for inclusion in certain Nathan’s Famous restaurants, as well as virtual kitchens.
 
We also partner with major third-party delivery service providers, such as DoorDash, UberEats, GrubHub, and Postmates, providing multiple options for our guests to continue to enjoy Nathan’s Famous products at home.
 
In fiscal 2021, Nathan’s opened its first virtual kitchens (existing kitchens with no Nathan’s Famous branded store front presence, used to fill online orders). During the fiscal 2022 period, we continued to grow the number of our virtual kitchens to expand our delivery options and to reach even more of our customers. At March 27, 2022, there were 287 virtual kitchens operating in 20 states and 6 foreign countries. We believe that virtual kitchens’ popularity will remain after the specter of COVID-19 passes.
 
Nathan’s restaurant designs are available in a range of sizes from 300 to 4,000 square feet. We have also developed various Nathan’s carts, kiosks, mobile food carts, trucks and modular units. Our smaller units may not have customer seating areas, although they may often share seating areas with other fast food or quick service outlets in food court settings. Other units generally provide seating for 45 to 125 customers. Carts, kiosks and modular units generally carry only the core menu. Our food trucks may carry the full Nathan’s Famous menu.
 
We believe that Nathan’s carts, kiosks, modular units and food court designs are particularly well-suited for placement in non-traditional sites, such as airports, travel plazas, stadiums, schools, convenience stores, entertainment facilities, military facilities, business and industry foodservice, within larger retail operations and other captive markets. Many of these settings may also be appropriate for expanding our Branded Menu Program or Branded Product Program. All of these units feature the Nathan’s logo and utilize a contemporary design.
 
Franchise Operations
 
At March 27, 2022, our Nathan’s franchise system, including our Branded Menu Program, consisted of 239 units operating in 18 states and twelve foreign countries (including 27 BMP locations in Ukraine which are temporarily closed as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict). It also included 287 virtual kitchens located in 20 states and 6 foreign countries.
 
  8 



Our franchise system includes among its franchisees such well-known companies as Applegreen USA Welcome Centres, LLC, HMS Host, Areas USA, National Amusements, Inc., Hershey Entertainment & Resorts Company, and Bruster’s Real Ice Cream. We continue to market our franchising programs to larger, experienced and successful operators with the financial and business capability to develop multiple franchise units, as well as to individual owner-operators with evidence of restaurant management experience, net worth and sufficient capital.
 
During the fiscal 2022 period, no single franchisee accounted for over 10% of our consolidated revenue. At March 27, 2022, Applegreen USA Welcome Centres, LLC operated seven franchised outlets within highway travel plazas and HMS Host operated four franchised outlets, including three units at airports, and one unit within a mall. Additionally, 28 mobile carts were registered to operate in New York, NY, and 15 Bruster’s Real Ice Cream shops were selling Nathan’s products under our Branded Menu Program.
 
Growth Strategies 
 
Even amidst the ongoing challenges of COVID-19 during fiscal 2022, the Company embarked on a number of initiatives to promote the Nathan’s Famous brand and to position itself for future growth.
 
Retail licensing – We expect that our retail licensing program may continue to grow, centered around our licensing program with John Morrell & Co., a subsidiary of Smithfield Foods, Inc. John Morrell & Co. brings superior sales and marketing resources to our brand through its national scale, broad distribution platform, strong retail relationships and research and development infrastructure capable of developing and introducing new products. As a result of our partnership with John Morrell & Co., we expect Nathan’s Famous products to continue penetrating the grocery, mass merchandising and club channels by expanding points of distribution in targeted, underpenetrated regions and through the development of new products. We believe John Morell & Co. expects to continue to leverage this relationship with continued full-scale marketing efforts, both inside and outside of stores, highlighted by exciting customer events and brand representation and support of our Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contests.
 
We may offer the licensing of other signature products to other qualified manufacturers.
 
Branded Products – We expect to continue the growth of our Branded Products Program through the addition of new accounts and venues. We believe that the flexible design of the Branded Products Program makes it well-suited for sales to all segments of the broad foodservice industry. We intend to keep targeting sales to a broad line of food distributors, which we believe complements our continuing focus on sales to various foodservice retailers. We continue to believe that as consumers look to brands and products with high standards, and integrity with the quality of the food that they purchase, there is great potential to increase our sales by converting existing sales of non-branded products to Nathan’s branded products throughout the foodservice industry.
Franchising – We expect to continue to market our franchise program and Branded Menu Program to large, experienced and successful operators with the financial and business capability to develop multiple franchise units, as well as to individual-owner operators with evidence of restaurant management experience, net worth and sufficient capital. We also expect to continue developing master franchise programs in foreign countries.
 
Company-owned restaurants – We may selectively consider opening new Company-owned restaurants on an opportunistic basis. We may also consider new opportunities in both traditional and captive market settings.
 
Improving restaurant level profitability – In terms of driving comparable restaurant sales, we remain focused on encouraging repeat visits by our guests and attracting new customers through continuous improvement to our menu offerings and quality of service. With the increase in online ordering and to-go sales, we have implemented changes to the “back of the house” for greater operational efficiencies in order fulfillment.
 
Expansion of Non-Traditional Development – The Company continues to focus its efforts on expanding its presence via delivery or virtual kitchens. In fiscal 2022, we announced a new development agreement with Branded Virtual Kitchens Canada, Ltd. (“BVK”) to expand our footprint into Canada. BVK offers operators the Nathan’s Famous full and authentic menu, including our Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries, New York Cheesesteak by Pat LaFrieda, angus beef hamburgers, hand-dipped chicken sandwiches, premium shakes and more.
 
    9 

  

The Company continues to target urban areas with its virtual kitchens, which makes delivery times faster and allows customers to easily secure their food as well.
 
These virtual kitchens have different rights and obligations than our traditional franchise agreements, including royalty rates and advertising contribution rates, and the sales levels at these locations differs from the sales levels at our traditional franchise restaurants.
 
Co-branding – We believe that there is a continuing opportunity for co-branding of our restaurant concept and/or menu items with our restaurant concepts, as well as within our restaurant system as new franchise opportunities are developed.
 
Driving awareness of our brand – As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company began offering a limited number of its menu offerings for customers to prepare at home. We have continued our relationship with Goldbelly, an online marketplace, to provide Nathan’s Famous favorite meals to consumers throughout the United States. The Company offers a number of make-at-home meal kits including its Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dog and crinkle-cut French fries. Other meal options include the NY Cheesesteak by Pat LaFrieda, and the Nathan’s Famous Footlong Hot Dog kit, both of which are shipped with Nathan’s Famous crinkle-cut French fries.
 
Advertising and promotion – The Company continues to focus its efforts using a multiple pronged approach, with a particular emphasis on geo-targeted, social media advertising to drive customers directly to online restaurant menus for ease of ordering for delivery or pick-up. The online effort is focused on platforms including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Our marketing strategy focuses on our premium food offerings and limited time offerings to help drive sales and customer traffic.
 
Expansion of Wings of New York – The Company continues to pursue opportunities to expand its Wings of New York, a virtual restaurant concept offering New York style chicken wings, hand-dipped chicken tenders as well as Nathan’s Famous extra-long hot dog. In fiscal 2022, the Company opened this concept inside the famed Yankee Stadium.
Re-launching Arthur Treacher’s – In fiscal 2022, the Company opened its first Arthur Treacher’s virtual kitchens, serving quality fried seafood menu items such as fish and chips platters, fish sandwiches, fried shrimp and more. The Company intends to offer “upgraded proteins” with a stronger emphasis on shrimp. Additionally, we have expanded our partnership with Franklin Junction to include Arthur Treacher’s along with the Nathan’s Famous and Wings of New York offerings.
Nathan’s Standard Franchise Program

Franchisees are required to execute a standard franchise agreement prior to opening each Nathan’s Famous unit. Our current standard Nathan’s Famous franchise agreement provides for, among other things, a one-time $30,000 franchise fee payable upon execution of the agreement, a monthly royalty payment based on 5.5% of restaurant sales and the expenditure of up to 2.0% of restaurant sales on advertising. We may offer alternatives to the standard franchise agreement, having to do with franchise royalties, fees or advertising requirements. The initial term of the typical franchise agreement is 10 years, with a 5-year renewal option by the franchisee, subject to conditions contained in the franchise agreement.
 
Franchisees are approved on the basis of their business background, evidence of restaurant management experience, net worth and capital available for investment in relation to the proposed scope of the development agreement.
 
We provide numerous support services to our Nathan’s Famous franchisees. We assist in and approve all site selections. Thereafter, we provide architectural plans suitable for restaurants of varying sizes and configurations for use in food court, in-line and free-standing locations. We also assist in establishing building design specifications, reviewing construction compliance, equipping the restaurant and providing appropriate menus to coordinate with the restaurant design and location selected by the franchisee.
 
  10 



We offer various management training courses for management personnel of Company owned and franchised Nathan’s Famous restaurants. A restaurant manager from each restaurant must successfully complete our mandated management training program. We also offer additional operations and general management training courses for all restaurant managers and other managers with supervisory responsibilities. We provide standard manuals to each franchisee covering training and operations, products and equipment and local marketing programs. We also provide ongoing advice and assistance to franchisees. We meet with our franchisees to discuss upcoming marketing events, menu development and other topics, each of which is designed to provide individual restaurant and system-wide benefits.
 
Franchised restaurants are required to be operated in accordance with uniform operating standards and specifications relating to the selection, quality and preparation of menu items, signage, decor, equipment, uniforms, suppliers, maintenance and cleanliness of premises and customer service. All standards and specifications are developed by us to be applied on a system-wide basis. We regularly monitor franchisee operations and inspect restaurants. Franchisees are required to furnish us with monthly sales or operating reports which assist us in monitoring the franchisee’s compliance with its franchise agreement. We make both announced and unannounced inspections of restaurants to ensure that our practices and procedures are followed. We have the right to terminate a franchise if a franchisee does not operate and maintain a restaurant in accordance with the requirements of its franchise agreement, including for non-payment of royalties, sale of unauthorized products, bankruptcy or conviction of a felony.
 
A franchisee who desires to open multiple units in a specific territory within the United States may enter into an area development agreement under which we would expect to receive an area development fee based upon the number of proposed units which the franchisee is authorized to open. With respect to our international development, we generally grant exclusive territorial rights in foreign countries for the development of Nathan’s units based upon compliance with a predetermined development schedule. Additionally, we may further grant exclusive manufacturing and distribution rights in foreign countries, and we may require an exclusivity fee to be conveyed for such exclusive rights.
 
Nathan’s Branded Menu Program
 
Our Nathan’s Famous Branded Menu Program enables qualified foodservice operators to offer a Nathan’s Famous menu of Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries, proprietary toppings, and a limited menu of other Nathan’s products. Under the Branded Menu Program, the operator may use the Nathan’s Famous trademarks on signage and as part of its menu boards. Additionally, the operator may use Nathan’s Famous paper goods and point of sale marketing materials. Nathan’s also provides architectural and design services, training and operation manuals in conjunction with this program. The operator provides Nathan’s with a fee and is required to sign a 10-year agreement. Nathan’s does not collect a royalty based on the operator’s sales and the operator is not required to report sales to Nathan’s as required by the standard franchise arrangements. Instead, the Branded Menu Program operator is required to purchase products from Nathan’s approved distributors and we earn our royalties from such purchases.
Arthur Treacher’s
 
Arthur Treacher’s Fish-n-Chips, Inc. was originally founded in 1969. Arthur Treacher’s main product is its “Original Fish-n-Chips,” consisting of fish fillets coated with a special batter prepared under a proprietary formula, deep-fried golden brown, and served with English-style chips and corn meal “hush puppies.” 
 
We are the sole owner of all rights to the Arthur Treacher’s brand and the exclusive franchisor of the Arthur Treacher’s restaurant system (subject to a limited license granted to PAT Franchise Systems, Inc. (“PFSI”) in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, (“the PFSI Markets”). Pursuant to the license, PFSI has no obligation to pay fees or royalties to us in connection with its use of the Arthur Treacher’s intellectual property within the PFSI Markets. As a result of PFSI’s failure to satisfy the development schedules for each of the territories, all future development rights have reverted back to Nathan’s.
 
As of March 27, 2022, Arthur Treacher’s, as a co-brand, was included within 23 Nathan’s Famous restaurants. Additionally, we operate seven Arthur Treacher’s BMP locations.
 
  11 



Company-owned Nathan’s Restaurant Operations
 
As of March 27, 2022, we operated four Company-owned Nathan’s restaurants, including one seasonal location, in New York. Our seasonal location on the Coney Island Boardwalk opened for the fiscal 2023 summer season on April 1, 2022.
 
Three of our Company-owned restaurants range in size from approximately 2,650 square feet to 10,000 square feet and have seating to accommodate between 60 and 125 customers. These restaurants are open seven days a week on a year-round basis and are designed to appeal to consumers of all ages. We have established high standards for food quality, cleanliness, and service at our restaurants and regularly monitor the operations of our restaurants to ensure adherence to these standards.
 
Two of our Company-owned restaurants have contemporary service areas, seating, signage, and general decor. Our Coney Island restaurant, which first opened in 1916, remains unique in its presentation and operations.
 
Our Company-owned restaurants typically carry a broader selection of menu items than our franchise restaurants and generally attain sales levels higher than the average of our newer franchise restaurants. The non-core menu items at the Company-owned restaurants, tend to have lower margins than the core menu.

International Development
 
As of March 27, 2022, Nathan’s Famous franchisees operated 71 units in twelve foreign countries.

During fiscal 2022, our master franchisee in Brazil, began manufacturing and distributing three of our proprietary products – Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries, and hot dog rolls.
 
We may seek to continue granting exclusive territorial rights for franchising and for the manufacturing and distribution rights in foreign countries, and we expect to require that an exclusivity fee be conveyed for these rights. We plan to develop the restaurant franchising system internationally through the use of master franchising agreements based upon individual or combined use of our existing restaurant concepts and for the distribution of Nathan’s products.
 
The following table is a summary of our international operations for the fiscal years ended March 27, 2022 and March 28, 2021: See Item 1A-“Risk Factors.”

Branded Product Program 

Our Branded Products Program was significantly impacted by COVID-19 beginning in March 2020 and impacted the results of our operations in fiscal 2021. As COVID-19 spread throughout the United States, governmental authorities implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These governmental restrictions and public perceptions of the risks associated with COVID-19 caused consumers to avoid or limit nonessential travel, gatherings in public places and other social interactions, which adversely affected sales to our Branded Product Program customers.
 
During fiscal 2022, the number of COVID-19 cases stabilized with approved vaccines being more widely distributed and administered and, as a result, more regions loosened restrictions, adhering to state and local guidelines. Most of our Branded Product Program customers have reopened, such as professional sports venues, amusement parks, shopping malls and movie theaters. As such, the total volume of hot dogs sold in the Branded Product Program returned to pre-pandemic levels.
 
In fiscal 2022, the cost of hot dogs has increased significantly due to higher costs for beef and beef trimmings, labor, packaging, and transportation, as well as supply chain challenges associated with increased consumer demand as a result of the continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the income from operations from our Branded Product Program was negatively impacted.
 
Through the Branded Product Program, Nathan’s provides qualified foodservice operators in a variety of venues the opportunity to capitalize on Nathan’s valued brand by marketing and selling primarily Nathan’s Famous hot dog products. We believe that the program is unique in its flexibility and broad appeal. Nathan’s hot dogs are offered in a variety of sizes and additional specialty products, such as pretzel dogs, are available to satisfy consumer needs. In conjunction with the program, the operators are granted a limited use of the Nathan’s Famous trademark, as well as Nathan’s point of purchase materials. We earn income by selling our products either directly to key accounts or to various foodservice distributors or redistributors who resell the products to specific operators.
 
As of March 27, 2022, the Branded Product Program distributed product in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Canada, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and Mexico. Pursuant to the Branded Product Program, Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs are being offered in national restaurant chains such as Auntie Anne’s, Hot Dog On A Stick and Johnny Rockets; national movie theater chains such as Regal Entertainment, National Amusements and Cinemex in Mexico; amusement parks such as Six Flags and Universal Studios; casino hotels such as Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut; and convenience store chains such as Race Trac and Holiday Station stores. The Branded Products Program also distributes product in professional sports arenas with Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs being served in stadiums and arenas that host the New York Yankees, New York Mets, Brooklyn Nets, Dallas Cowboys, Miami Marlins, Colorado Rockies and Green Bay Packers.
 
Additionally, our products are offered in numerous other foodservice operations including cafeterias, snack bars and vending machines located in many different types of foodservice outlets and venues, including airports, highway travel plazas, colleges and universities, gas and convenience stores, military installations, and Veterans Administration hospitals throughout the United States.

Nathan’s expects to continue to seek out and evaluate a variety of alternative environments designed to maximize and grow our Branded Product Program.

Licensing Program
 
Pursuant to an Agreement expiring in March 2032, John Morrell & Co., a subsidiary of Smithfield Foods, Inc., has been granted, among other things, (i) the exclusive right and obligation to manufacture, distribute, market and sell “Nathan’s Famous” branded hot dog, sausage and corned beef products in refrigerated consumer packages to be resold through retail channels (e.g., supermarkets, groceries, mass merchandisers and club stores) within the United States, (ii) a right of first offer to license any other “Nathan’s Famous” branded refrigerated meat products in consumer packages to be resold through retail channels within the United States, on terms to be negotiated in good faith, (iii) the right and obligation to manufacture “Nathan’s Famous” branded hot dog and sausage products in bulk for use in the food service industry within the United States, and (iv) the non-exclusive right and obligation to supply “Nathan’s Famous” natural casing and skinless hot dogs in bulk for use in the “Nathan’s Famous” restaurant system within the United States. The Agreement provides for royalties on packaged products sold to supermarkets, club stores and grocery stores, payable on a monthly basis to the Company equal to 10.8% of net sales, subject to minimum annual guaranteed royalties of at least $10 million in the first year of the term and which minimum guaranteed royalties increase annually throughout the term. Pursuant to this Agreement, Nathan’s earned royalties of approximately $27,907,000 in fiscal 2022 and $27,778,000 in fiscal 2021 representing 24.3% and 36.6% of total revenues, respectively. We believe our future operating results will continue to be substantially impacted by the terms and conditions of the agreement with John Morrell & Co., but there can be no assurance thereof (See Item 1A - “Risk Factors”). Since 2002, John Morrell & Co. has licensed from us the right to manufacture and sell branded hot dogs and sausages to selected foodservice accounts.  Pursuant to this arrangement, we earned royalties of $1,063,000 and $916,000 during the fiscal 2022 and 2021 period, respectively.  The majority of these royalties were earned from one company.  As of March 27, 2022, packaged Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs continued to be sold in supermarkets, mass merchandisers and club stores including Walmart, Kroger, Ahold, Publix, Albertsons, Safeway, ShopRite, Target, Sam’s Club, Costco and BJ’s Wholesale Club located in all 50 states. We believe that the overall exposure of the brand and opportunity for consumers to enjoy the Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dog in their homes helps promote “Nathan’s Famous” restaurant patronage. Royalties earned under the retail agreement, including the foodservice program, were approximately 91% of our fiscal 2022 period license revenues.
 
We license the manufacture of the proprietary spices which are used to produce Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs to Saratoga Specialties, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of John Morrell & Co. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we earned royalties of $1,216,000 and $1,022,000, respectively, from this license. Through this agreement, we control the manufacture of all Nathan’s hot dogs.
 
During fiscal 2022, our licensee, Lamb Weston, Inc., continued to produce and distribute Nathan’s Famous frozen crinkle-cut French fries and onion rings for retail sale pursuant to a license agreement. These products were distributed within 39 states, primarily on the East Coast and in the Southwest and West Coast during fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we earned royalties of $954,000 and $1,137,000, respectively, under this agreement. For the contract year ended in July 2021 we earned royalties of $603,000 in excess of the annual minimum. Lamb Weston, Inc. continues to seek to further expand its market penetration throughout the United States. Lamb Weston, Inc. exercised its third option to extend the license agreement through July 2023, pursuant to which the minimum royalties will increase 4% annually.
 
During fiscal 2022, our licensee, Bran-Zan Holdings, LLC continued to produce and distribute miniature bagel dogs, franks-in-a-blanket, mozzarella sticks and other hors d’oeuvres through club stores, supermarkets, and other retail food stores. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we earned royalties of $333,000 and $211,000, respectively, under this agreement.
 
During fiscal 2022, our licensee, Hermann Pickle Packers, Inc. continued to produce and distribute Nathan’s Famous sauerkraut and pickles pursuant to a license agreement. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we earned royalties of $291,000 and $262,000, respectively, under this agreement.

Provisions and Supplies 

Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs are primarily manufactured by John Morrell & Co. for sale by our Branded Product Program, our restaurant system, and at retail. John Morrell & Co. and other hot dog manufacturers supply the hot dogs for our Company-operated and franchise-operated restaurants. All hot dogs are manufactured in accordance with Nathan’s recipes, quality standards and proprietary spice formulations. Nathan’s believes that it has reliable sources of supply; however, in the event of any significant disruption in supply, management believes that alternative sources of supply are available. (See Item 1A- “Risk Factors”).  Saratoga Specialties, Inc. produces Nathan’s proprietary spice formulations, and we have, in the past, engaged Newly Weds Foods, Inc. as an alternative source of supply. Our frozen crinkle-cut French fries have been produced primarily by Lamb Weston, Inc.
 
Most other Company provisions are purchased from multiple sources to prevent disruption in supply and to obtain competitive prices. We approve all products and product specifications. We negotiate directly with our suppliers on behalf of the entire system for all primary food ingredients and beverage products sold in the restaurants in an effort to ensure adequate supply of high-quality items at competitive prices.
 
We currently utilize a cooperative distribution system pursuant to an agreement with UniPro Foodservice, Inc., the Multi-Unit Group, which is comprised of institutional food and non-food distributors organized to procure, distribute, and market food service and non-food merchandise for the distribution needs of our domestic restaurant system. The initial term of the agreement is for five (5) years, through November 15, 2022 and continuing for two successive one year renewal periods upon mutual consent. We believe this arrangement allows for more flexibility in expanding into new markets throughout the United States, as well as proves to be cost efficient for our current franchisees. The strategic distribution partners under this agreement include: DiCarlo Distributors, Inc., Tapia Brothers Co., Cheney Brothers, Inc., Feesers, Inc., Lipari Foods, LLC, Kuna Foodservice, and Chain Distribution Services LLC. Our branded products are delivered to our ultimate customers throughout the country by numerous distributors, including US Foodservice, Inc., SYSCO Corporation, Vistar/Performance Food Group, McLane and DOT Foods.
 
Marketing, Promotion and Advertising         

Nathan’s believes that an integral part of its brand marketing strategy is to continue to build brand awareness through its complimentary points of distribution strategy of selling its signature products through Company-owned and franchised restaurants (including virtual kitchens), the Branded Product Program, the Branded Menu Program, and within supermarkets and club stores. We believe that as we continue to build brand awareness and expand our reputation for quality and value, we will continue to seek to grow existing markets and expand into new markets. The Nathan’s Famous brand continues to enjoy tremendous exposure and awareness from our Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contests. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all regional hot dog eating contests were canceled in fiscal 2021. However, while the regionals were canceled, our annual July 4th Hot Dog Eating Contest Championship was held at Maimonides Park, a minor league baseball stadium on the Riegelmann Boardwalk in Coney Island and home to the Brooklyn Cyclones. ESPN aired our July 4th Hot Dog Eating Championship Contest as it has done since 2004.
 
Nathan’s Famous continues to look to sports sponsorships as a strategic marketing opportunity to further brand recognition. In addition to the branded signage opportunity, Nathan’s sells its Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs and crinkle-cut French fries. In many venues, Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs and crinkle-cut French fries are sold at Nathan’s concession stands and as menu items that are served in suites and throughout premium seating areas. Nathans’ current professional sports sponsorships include:
 

● | Baseball: Yankee Stadium – New York Yankees; Citi Field – New York Mets; Marlins Park – Miami Marlins; Coors Field – Colorado Rockies; Tropicana Field – Tampa Bay Rays; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Basketball: The Barclays Center – Brooklyn Nets; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | Football: AT&T Stadium – Dallas Cowboys; Lambeau Field – Green Bay Packers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that the Company’s overall sales and exposure have also been complemented by the sales of Nathan’s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs and other Nathan’s products through the publicity generated by our Hot Dog Eating Contests and our affiliation with a number of high profile sports arenas. In addition to marketing our products at these venues, the Nathan’s Famous brand has also been televised regionally, nationally and internationally.
 
We maintain an advertising fund for local, regional and national advertising under the Nathan’s Famous Systems, Inc. Franchise Agreement. Nathan’s Famous franchisees are generally required to spend on local marketing activities or contribute to the advertising fund up to 2.0% of restaurant sales for advertising and promotion. Franchisee contributions to the advertising fund for national marketing support are generally based upon the type of restaurant and its location. The difference, if any, between 2.0% and the contribution to the advertising fund are to be expended on local programs approved by us as to form, content and method of dissemination. Certain franchisees, including those operating pursuant to our Branded Menu Program were not obligated to contribute to the advertising fund during fiscal 2022. Vendors that supply products to the Company and our restaurant system also contribute to the advertising fund based upon purchases made by our franchisees and at Company-owned restaurants.
 
In fiscal 2022, Nathan’s marketing efforts were largely focused on the annual July 4th Hot Dog Eating Contest and its sports sponsorships, as well as advertising spending online to drive customers directly to the online menus of our franchisees. This included geo-targeted efforts to generate awareness and sales through third party delivery platforms.
 
Nathan’s marketing efforts include employing an “always on” social media strategy to support the brand and franchise operations through our centralized brand presence. The social media objectives include increasing our reach among our core customer base, while building brand awareness amongst the engaged younger generation.
 
The objective of our Branded Product Program has historically been to seek to provide our foodservice operator customers with value-added, premium quality products supported with differentiated point of sale materials and other forms of operational support.
 
During fiscal 2022, Nathan’s marketing efforts for the Branded Product Program concentrated primarily on participation in national industry trade shows, and regional, local distributor trade events, some of which were held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also advertised our products in distributor and trade periodicals. Most of the sales of new restaurant franchises to franchisees are achieved through the direct effort of Company personnel. New arrangements with Branded Product Program points of sale are achieved through the combined efforts of Company personnel and a network of foodservice brokers and distributors who also are responsible for direct sales to national, regional and “street” accounts.
 
During fiscal 2023, we may seek to further expand our internal marketing resources along with our network of foodservice brokers and distributors. We may attempt to emphasize specific venues as we expand our broker network, focus management and broker responsibilities on a regional basis and expand the use of sales incentive programs. We continue to upgrade our social media platforms by enhancing our corporate website and Facebook page and expanding the use of Instagram and Twitter.
 
Human Capital
 
As of March 27, 2022, the Company employed 131 people, 32 of whom were corporate management and administrative employees, 23 of whom were restaurant managers and 76 of whom were hourly full-time and part-time foodservice employees.
 
As of March 27, 2022, more than 51% of our employees were female and approximately 74% of our employee population were comprised of racial and ethnic minorities.
 
We generally employ approximately 250-275 seasonal employees during the spring and summer months. Food service employees at two Company-owned locations are currently represented by Local 1102 RWSDU UFCW AFL-CIO, CLC, Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, under an agreement that expires on June 30, 2023. Employees at a third location are represented by the same union pursuant to a different agreement that expires on November 30, 2022.
 
    17 

  

We believe that our efforts to manage our workforce have been effective as evidenced by the fact that the Company has not suffered any strike or work stoppage for more than 48 years.
 
Culture and diversity
 
Creating and fostering inclusive work environments and teams allows us to create an engaging and welcoming culture for our employees, which we believe positively affects the quality of products and experience we deliver to our customers.
 
The Company works to ensure our recruiting and hiring initiatives are reaching a broad audience, so that our workforce represents the communities in which we serve. We seek to provide opportunities for growth and development at all levels of our organization.
 
Our workforce represents nearly all demographics, with diversity in age, race, ethnicity and gender. Specifically, we employ more women than men and more employees identify as racial and ethnic minorities, than white.
 
Compensation and Benefits
 
The Company is committed to providing market-competitive and equitable pay and benefits to attract and retain great talent. In addition to competitive hourly rates and base salaries, all management employees at our Company-operated restaurants are eligible for performance-based cash incentive bonuses based on the attainment of certain financial metrics, along with all corporate management and administrative employees, at the discretion of our Board of Directors.
 
The Company attempts to provide a range of benefits to its corporate and nonunion employees and their families, including medical and prescription drug, dental and vision, long-term disability coverage, as well as a 401(k) savings and flexible spending accounts. The Company has historically matched contributions to its 401(k) savings plan at a rate of $0.25 per dollar contributed by the employee up to a maximum of 3% of the employee’s annual salary. The Company pays the union medical and pension benefits on behalf of the union employees.
 
Talent Development
 
We offer various management training courses for management personnel of our Company-owned and franchised Nathan’s Famous restaurants. A restaurant manager from each restaurant must successfully complete our mandated management training program.
 
Safety of our employees and customers during COVID-19
 
We are committed to providing safe work environments and providing our employees with the resources they need to promote their well-being. We are also committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for our restaurant patrons. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to monitor public health guidance and to follow recommendations by federal, state and local governments.
 
Government Regulation         

We are subject to Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) regulation and several states’ laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises. We are also subject to a number of state laws which regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship.
 
The FTC’s “Trade Regulation Rule Concerning Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchising and Business Opportunity Ventures” (the “FTC Rule”) requires us to disclose certain information to prospective franchisees. Fifteen states, including New York, also require similar disclosure. While the FTC Rule does not require registration or filing of the disclosure document, 14 states require franchisors to register the disclosure document (or obtain exemptions from that requirement) before offering or selling a franchise. The laws of 17 other states require some form of registration (or a determination that a company is exempt or otherwise not required to register) under “business opportunity” laws, which sometimes apply to franchisors such as the Company. These laws have not precluded us from seeking or awarding franchisees in any given area.
 
    18 

  

Laws that regulate one or another aspect of the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in 24 states as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These laws regulate the franchise relationship by, for example, requiring the franchisor to deal with its franchisees in good faith, prohibiting interference with the right of free association among franchisees, limiting the imposition of standards of performance on a franchisee, and regulating discrimination among franchisees. Although these laws may also restrict a franchisor in the termination of a franchise agreement by, for example, requiring “good cause” to exist as a basis for the termination, advance notice to the franchisee of the termination, an opportunity to cure a default, and repurchase of inventory or other compensation, these provisions have not had a significant effect on our operations. Our international franchise operations are subject to franchise-related and other laws in the jurisdictions in which our franchisees operate. These laws in the United States and overseas have not precluded us from enforcing the terms of our franchise agreements, and we do not believe that these laws are likely to significantly affect our operations. We cannot assess the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our operations in that region or elsewhere in Eastern Europe; however, an interruption in that part of our business is not likely to significantly affect our operations.
 
We are not aware of any pending franchise legislation in the United States that we believe is likely to significantly affect our operations.
 
Each Company-owned and franchised restaurant is subject to regulation as to operational matters by federal agencies and to licensing and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, safety, fire and other departments. An inability to obtain or retain health department or other licenses could adversely affect our operations.
 
We are subject to the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act and various other federal and state laws that govern minimum wages, overtime, working conditions, mandatory benefits, health insurance, and other matters. Other regulatory interpretations (such as the National Labor Relations Board’s review of joint employment standards under the National Labor Relations Act, the Labor Department’s review of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Small Business Administration’s review of independence standards applicable to reviewing franchisee loan applications, etc.) may have an impact on our overall business as well, although we do not believe that these will significantly affect our operations. We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, which have not had a material effect on our operations. More stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations. In addition, the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act applies with respect to the design, construction and renovation of all restaurants in the United States.
 
Each company that manufactures, supplies or sells our products is subject to regulation by federal agencies and to licensing and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, safety and other departments.
 
In fiscal 2020, 2021 and 2022, various governmental bodies in the United States have addressed the spread of COVID-19 by imposing limitations on business operations or recommending that residents adopt stringent “social distancing” measures. These measures may be reinstituted periodically and in some regions in an effort to inhibit the spread of new virus variants. Those formal and informal restraints, as well as consumer behavior and other factors (such as supply chain issues), may have a material impact on our ability to operate our business at least while those restrictions are in effect, which may possibly have a longer-term impact on our business and the demand for our products and restaurant services.
 
We are also subject to the requirement that our restaurants post certain calorie content information for standard menu items, pursuant to Section 4205 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Some of our restaurants are subject to similar requirements that are imposed by certain localities around the country.
 
Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each restaurant that sells such products to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities, for a license or permit to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of the restaurants, including minimum age of customers and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. Three of our Company-owned restaurants offer beer or wine coolers for sale. Each of these restaurants has current alcoholic beverage licenses permitting the sale of these beverages. We have never had an alcoholic beverage license revoked. 
 
    19 

  

We may be subject in certain states to “dram-shop” statutes, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment which wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to such person. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance and have never been named as a defendant in a lawsuit involving “dram-shop” statutes.
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, and rules promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Nasdaq Stock Market have imposed substantial regulations and disclosure requirements in the areas of corporate governance (including director independence, director selection and audit, corporate governance and compensation committee responsibilities), equity compensation plans, auditor independence, pre-approval of auditor fees and services and disclosure and internal control procedures. We are committed to industry best practices in these areas.
 
We believe that we operate in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing our operations, including the FTC Rule and state franchise laws.
 
Trademarks 
 
We hold trademark and/or service mark registrations for NATHAN’S, NATHAN’S FAMOUS, NATHAN’S FAMOUS and design, NATHAN’S and Coney Island design, SINCE 1916 NATHAN’S FAMOUS and design, SINCE 1916 NATHAN’S FAMOUS, INC. and design, THE ORIGINAL SINCE 1916 NATHAN’S FAMOUS and design, SINCE 1916 NATHAN’S FAMOUS THIS IS THE ORIGINAL, THE ORIGINAL NATHAN’S FAMOUS, THE ORIGINAL NATHAN’S FAMOUS 100TH ANNIVERSARY and design in color, SINCE 1916 NATHAN’S FAMOUS and hot dog design in color, SINCE 1916 NATHAN’S FAMOUS and hot dog, fries and drink design in color, and NATHAN’S FAMOUS EXPRESS within the United States, with some of these marks holding corresponding foreign trademark and service mark registrations in over 80 international jurisdictions, including Canada and China.  We also hold various package design registrations and other related marks, FRANKSTERS, FROM A HOT DOG TO AN INTERNATIONAL HABIT, and MORE THAN JUST THE BEST HOT DOG! and design, for restaurant services and some food items. 
 
We hold trademark and/or service mark registrations for the marks ARTHUR TREACHER’S (stylized), ARTHUR TREACHER’S FISH & CHIPS (stylized), KRUNCH PUP and ORIGINAL within the United States.  We hold service mark registrations for ARTHUR TREACHER’S in China and Japan. We also hold service mark registrations for ARTHUR TREACHER’S FISH & CHIPS in Canada, ARTHUR TREACHER’S FISH & CHIPS and design in Canada and Mexico, and ARTHUR TREACHER’S FISH & CHIPS and design in Colombia, Costa Rica, Kuwait, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.
 
Our trademark and service mark registrations were granted and expire on various dates. We believe that these trademarks and service marks provide significant value to us and are an important factor in the marketing of our products and services.  We believe that we do not infringe on the trademarks or other intellectual property rights of any third parties. 
 
Seasonality
 
Our routine business pattern is affected by seasonal fluctuations, including the effects of weather and economic conditions. Historically, sales from our Company-owned locations, principally at Coney Island, and franchised restaurants from which franchise royalties are earned and the Company’s earnings have been highest during our first two fiscal quarters, with the fourth fiscal quarter typically representing the slowest period. Routine seasonality is primarily attributable to weather conditions in the marketplace for our Company-owned and franchised restaurants, which are principally located in the Northeast of the United States. Additionally, revenues from our Branded Product Program and retail licensing program generally follow similar seasonal fluctuations, although not to the same degree. We believe that future revenues and profits will continue to be highest during our first two fiscal quarters, with the fourth fiscal quarter representing the slowest period.
 
  20 



Competition
 
The fast-food restaurant industry is highly competitive and can be significantly affected by many factors, including changes in local, regional or national economic conditions, changes in consumer tastes, consumer concerns about the nutritional quality of quick-service food, as well as the increases in and the locations of, competing restaurants.
 
Our restaurant system competes with numerous restaurants and drive-in units operating on both a national and local basis, including major national chains with greater financial and other resources than ours. We also compete with local restaurants and diners on the basis of menu diversity, food quality, price, size, site location and name recognition. There is also active competition for management personnel, as well as for suitable commercial sites for owned or franchised restaurants.
 
We believe that our emphasis on our signature products and the reputation of these products for taste and quality set us apart from our major competitors. Many fast-food companies have adopted “value pricing” and/or deep discount strategies. Nathan’s markets our own form of “value pricing,” selling combinations of different menu items for a total price lower than the usual sale price of the individual items and other forms of price sensitive promotions. Our value pricing strategy may offer multi-sized alternatives to our value-priced combo meals.
 
We also compete with many restaurant franchisors and other business concepts for the sale of franchises to qualified and financially capable franchisees.
 
Our Branded Product Program competes directly with a variety of other nationally recognized hot dog companies and other food companies; many of these entities have significantly greater resources than we do. Our products primarily compete based upon price, quality and value to the foodservice operator and consumer. We believe that Nathan’s reputation for superior quality, along with the ability to provide operational support to the foodservice operator, provides Nathan’s with a competitive advantage.
 
Our retail licensing program for the sale of packaged foods within supermarkets competes primarily on the basis of reputation, flavor, quality and price. In most cases, we compete against other nationally recognized brands that may have significantly greater resources than those at our disposal.
