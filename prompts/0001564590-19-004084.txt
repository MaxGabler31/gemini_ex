Company Overview 
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and seeks to commercialize therapeutic antibodies with the potential to meaningfully transform the treatment paradigm in migraine. All of our product candidates were discovered and developed by Alder scientists using our proprietary antibody technology platform coupled with a deliberate approach to design and select candidates with properties that we believe optimize the therapeutic potential for patients and commercial competitiveness.
 We are focusing our resources and development efforts principally on eptinezumab (ALD403), our solely-owned lead investigational product candidate, in order to maximize its therapeutic and commercial potential. On February 21, 2019, we submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for eptinezumab for the prevention of migraine.  The submission follows the successful completion of our pivotal trial program for eptinezumab, consisting of PRevention Of Migraine via Intravenous ALD403 Safety and Efficacy 1 (PROMISE 1), a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating eptinezumab for the prevention of frequent episodic migraine, and PRevention Of Migraine via Intravenous ALD403 Safety and Efficacy 2 (PROMISE 2), a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating eptinezumab for the prevention of chronic migraine.
 Migraine is a serious neurological disease affecting about 36 million people in the United States. Of that number, approximately 13 million people in the United States are candidates for a migraine prevention therapeutic. Of these candidates for migraine prevention, we estimate that there are between five million to seven million people living with episodic and chronic migraine who are the most highly impacted patients, and they typically experience eight or more migraine days per month. Epidemiologic studies suggest that approximately 27% of the candidates for migraine prevention have received preventive treatments. As a result, we believe there is a significant unmet need for new treatment and prevention options. We plan to focus our initial commercialization efforts for eptinezumab on the approximately 3,000 procedure oriented headache specialists that see the largest number of these highly impacted patients. 
 Eptinezumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody specific for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand, a small protein and a validated target that is understood to drive migraine initiation, maintenance and chronification. Designed to deliver a competitively differentiated approach to migraine prevention, we believe eptinezumab holds the potential to be a transformative therapeutic and meet a profound medical need, changing the migraine prevention treatment paradigm for physicians and patients living with migraine.
 Our deliberate approach to engineering and developing eptinezumab is designed to provide a unique clinical profile that, after a single administration via an infusion procedure, provides rapid, effective and sustained migraine prevention. We believe that this clinical profile, as supported by data from our clinical trials, will present a potentially compelling value proposition for patients, physicians, payors and our stakeholders.

Eptinezumab is the only potent and selective anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody in clinical development for migraine prevention delivered by quarterly infusion.  We believe that eptinezumab’s design, coupled with the infusion mode of administration, provides the following key benefits: 
  
• | High specificity and strong binding for rapid and sustained suppression of CGRP biology;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Allows for the total dose to be immediately active to inhibit CGRP with 100% bioavailability; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supervised administration by quarterly infusion has the potential to promote patient adherence while maximizing product control and consistency of delivery.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In PROMISE 1 and PROMISE 2, eptinezumab demonstrated the following characteristics:
  
1. | Rapid: Onset to prevention achieved on the first day post infusion
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Effective: Significant reductions in migraine days for months 1 through 3 and high ≥50%, ≥75% and 100% responder rates attained within 1 month following a single administration
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Sustained: Migraine free days sustained for 3 months following a single administration
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo and consistent with earlier eptinezumab studies
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Assuming eptinezumab administered via infusion is approved by the FDA, we plan to focus our initial commercialization efforts on procedure oriented headache specialists in the United States with a specialty sales force sizing of approximately 75 to 100. We believe that these procedure oriented headache specialists comprise neurologists, pain specialists and primary care physicians and treat the highest proportion of the five million to seven million highly impacted migraine patients described above. We estimate this group of procedure oriented headache specialists to number approximately 3,000 physicians. Our market research suggests that eptinezumab is well-positioned for adoption by physicians in this group due to the strength of eptinezumab’s clinical profile and mode of delivery via infusion. They also value patient adherence benefits associated with supervised administration by quarterly infusion and they have an infrastructure in place for patient flow, supply and reimbursement. We estimate that 94% of these physicians have previously prescribed an infusion therapy for migraine or other conditions within practice, hospital, or free-standing infusion centers. 
 We are committed to commercializing eptinezumab in the United States as a migraine prevention therapy, and are focused on capturing the full commercial value of eptinezumab globally. We recognize the potential for strategic partnerships or other arrangements that bring additional capabilities and infrastructure, as well as value to the program. Thus, as a key component of our commercial readiness activities, we are actively reviewing options for partnerships or arrangements that will allow us to realize the commercial potential of eptinezumab outside of the United States. We will only pursue partnerships or arrangements that we believe have the potential to deliver the greatest value to the eptinezumab program and our stakeholders.
 Our product candidate pipeline also includes ALD1910, a high specificity, high affinity neutralizing monoclonal antibody with reactivity to that targets pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP-38). PACAP has emerged as an important signaling molecule in the pathophysiology of migraine and represents an attractive novel target for treating migraine. New evidence indicates that PACAP may represent a unique and distinct pathway associated with migraine. Preclinical data indicate that PACAP and CGRP may have non-overlapping pharmacology with respect to migraine-associated symptoms.  PACAP and its three known receptors (PAC1, VPAC1 and VPAC2) are expressed in the regions of the brain known to be associated with migraine symptomatology. By blocking the ligand, ALD1910 prevents the signaling of PACAP by all three receptors, since they are all associated with migraine symptoms.  
 We recently completed preclinical studies showing ALD1910 was effective in blocking the effects of endogenous PACAP, in a dose-dependent manner, in an animal model of neurogenic vasodilation. We believe this further validates our view in developing new therapies that blocking the ligand versus blocking only one involved receptor is likely to be a more effective approach to treating migraine disease.
 We believe ALD1910 holds potential as a migraine treatment and could provide an important new therapeutic option to migraine patients and their physicians. We are advancing ALD1910 through toxicology studies to enable Phase 1 studies, which we expect to initiate by the end of 2019 and subsequently support an IND with the FDA.
 In May 2016, we licensed the exclusive worldwide rights for clazakizumab, another product candidate internally developed by Alder, to Vitaeris, Inc., or Vitaeris, based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Clazakizumab was designed to block the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6.  In November 2017 Alder and Vitaeris amended the license agreement for clazakizumab and Vitaeris and its shareholders, including Alder, entered into a strategic collaboration and purchase option agreement with a third party, CSL Limited (CSL), an Australian entity, to expedite the development of clazakizumab as a therapeutic option for solid organ transplant rejection.  Prior to the license to Vitaeris, clazakizumab completed two positive Phase 2b clinical trials establishing proof-of-concept in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Our Strategic Priorities 
 Our goal is to build an enduring biopharmaceutical company that discovers and selects monoclonal antibodies for development and commercialization that hold the potential to meaningfully transform current treatment paradigms and offer patients innovative therapies in indications with profound medical needs. Key strategic priorities for us to achieve that goal include: 

• | Secure regulatory approval of eptinezumab for the prevention of migraine. Our primary priority is to secure approval by the FDA of the eptinezumab BLA at the earliest opportunity. We also to plan to seek regulatory approval of eptinezumab in jurisdictions outside of the United States to facilitate potential partnerships or arrangements that we believe have the potential to deliver the greatest value to the eptinezumab program and our stakeholders. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimize the commercial potential of eptinezumab by commercializing it for the prevention of migraine. We are focused on capturing the full commercial value of eptinezumab globally. We intend to continue commercial readiness activities to support commercialization of eptinezumab in the United States as a migraine prevention therapy, subject to FDA approval. We initially plan to build a specialty sales force targeting the estimated 3,000 procedure oriented headache specialists in the United States to capture what we believe is a meaningful U.S. market opportunity for eptinezumab. We recognize the potential for strategic partnerships and/or other arrangements that bring additional capabilities and infrastructure, as well as value to the program. Thus, as a key component of our commercial readiness activities, we are actively reviewing options for partnerships or arrangements that will allow us to realize the commercial potential of eptinezumab outside of the United States.

• | Enhance the value of eptinezumab by maximizing its differentiating properties and clinical profile. We plan to explore the initiation of one or more additional clinical trials of our infusion formulation to maximize the differentiated therapeutic and commercial profile of eptinezumab.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Progress the development of ALD1910 as an additional treatment option for migraine. ALD1910 is our preclinical product candidate for the treatment of migraine. We believe ALD1910 holds potential as a migraine treatment and could provide an important new therapeutic option to migraine patients and their physicians. We are advancing ALD1910 through toxicology studies to enable Phase 1 studies, which we expect to initiate by the end of 2019 and subsequently support an IND with the FDA. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our proprietary antibody technology platform and deliberate design approach. We have brought together a group of world class scientists and drug developers that, when coupled with our proprietary technologies, allow us to discover, develop and commercialize antibody-based therapeutics that have the potential to change the lives of patients suffering from many types of disease. We intend to establish targeted commercialization and marketing capabilities for our products in the United States, and to discover and select candidates addressing areas of profound medical need and hold properties that we believe optimize the therapeutic potential for patients and commercial competitiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Pipeline
 Our product candidate pipeline is composed of candidates discovered and developed by Alder scientists using our proprietary antibody technology platform and a deliberate approach to design and select candidates to have properties that we believe optimize the therapeutic potential for patients and commercial competitiveness. Leveraging this platform, we select for antibody properties that we consider important in order to optimize safety, tolerability and efficacy, along with other properties that support reduced dosing volumes and frequency, time to onset of therapeutic effect, route of administration flexibility and other benefits. 
 We direct our pipeline efforts to treat central nervous system (CNS) diseases and pain where we believe there is a profound medical need and where a monoclonal antibody can offer an innovative and a best-in-class or first-in-class therapeutic option conveying safety and efficacy advantages compared to existing therapies.  Our pipeline currently includes two internally discovered humanized monoclonal antibodies, as well as preclinical programs targeting additional indications that are in the discovery phase. 
 Eptinezumab

 Overview
 Eptinezumab, our solely owned lead investigational product candidate, is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody specific for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand. CGRP is a small protein and a validated biological target that is understood to drive migraine initiation, maintenance and chronification. Eptinezumab was discovered by Alder scientists and is the result of a deliberate process coupled with proprietary technologies to design a monoclonal antibody inhibiting CGRP that delivers a competitively differentiated profile and a unique clinical benefit to patients. We believe eptinezumab holds the potential to be a transformative therapeutic and meet a profound medical need, changing the migraine prevention treatment paradigm for physicians and patients living with migraine. 
 On February 21, 2019, we submitted a BLA to the FDA for eptinezumab for the prevention of migraine.  Eptinezumab has been successfully evaluated in multiple clinical trials, including two Phase 3 clinical trials, PROMISE 1 and PROMISE 2. Our clinical data 
 5


to date demonstrates that, after a single 30 minute administration via an infusion procedure, eptinezumab provided rapid, effective and sustained migraine prevention. Eptinezumab is the only potent and selective anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody in clinical development for migraine prevention delivered by quarterly infusion. We believe that eptinezumab’s design, coupled with the infusion mode of administration, provides the following key benefits: 
  
• | Very high specificity and strong binding for rapid and sustained suppression of CGRP biology;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Allows for the total dose to be immediately active to inhibit CGRP with 100% bioavailability; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supervised administration by quarterly infusion has the potential to promote patient adherence while maximizing product control and consistency of delivery.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that the emerging profile of eptinezumab, with its potential to rapidly and significantly reduce the number of migraine days that patients experience, with benefit sustained for at least three months after a single administration, including the potential for patients to experience a 75% or greater reduction in migraine days and be 100% migraine free as demonstrated during our Phase 3 clinical trials, addresses key therapeutic needs of patients and physicians and competes favorably with existing treatments and other treatments currently in development. In addition to its favorable emerging safety and efficacy profile, we believe eptinezumab quarterly HCP administered dosing regimen supports patient adherence and product control.
 About Migraine
 Migraine is a highly symptomatic and debilitating neurological disease. With approximately 36 million Americans living with migraine, it is considered the third most prevalent and the sixth most disabling disease in the world, and in people under the age of 50 years, migraine is the most disabling disease. In the United States, employers lose more than $13 billion each year as a result of 113 million lost work days due to migraine. Migraine is also a significant cause of emergency rooms visits, with estimates reaching over 1 million visits annually. Over the time period 2008 to 2013, healthcare costs for chronic migraine, including co-morbid conditions, reached $41 billion, and 88% of the chronic migraine patients have at least one co-morbid condition. The smaller sector of chronic migraine patients with four or more co-morbidities accounted for $28 billion of the $41 billion total. 
 Migraine is a multifaceted disease associated with a hyper-excitable nervous system resulting from the complex interplay between genetics and the environment. Migraine symptoms typically include extreme pain, nausea, vomiting, extreme sensitivities to light and sound, and gastrointestinal issues. Migraine starts as an episodic disorder but becomes chronic over time as the threshold for migraine initiation is reduced, resulting in an increased frequency of migraine attacks and little or no return to normal baseline nervous system function between episodes.
 Of the 36 million people in the United States living with migraine, it is estimated that approximately 13 million are candidates for a preventative therapy. Of these candidates for migraine prevention, we estimate that there are between five million to seven million people living with episodic and chronic migraine who are the most highly impacted patients, and they typically experience eight or more migraine days per month. 
 Current Therapies.  Currently, pharmacological treatment for migraine can be divided into abortive and preventive therapy. Abortive medications aim to reverse, or at least stop, the progression of a migraine once it has started. Preventive medications, which are given even in the absence of a migraine, aim to reduce the frequency and severity of the migraine attack, make acute attacks more responsive to abortive medications and may improve the patient’s quality of life to a greater degree than abortive medications alone.   
 With some limitations and exceptions, FDA approved abortive medications are used successfully by many patients. However, for those patients living with migraine that are candidates for a preventative therapy, many options are associated with safety, efficacy and tolerability limitations, and often fail to meet the needs of most patients. Moreover, preventive treatments, if effective, may take weeks to months to achieve meaningful clinical benefit. According to international and national guidelines, and based on what available treatments can deliver, the current expectation for efficacy in migraine prevention is achievement of a 50% or greater reduction in migraine days. However, patients suffering from migraine deserve greater reductions in migraine days and the ability to achieve benefits more quickly. We believe that there is a significant need for rapid, effective and well-tolerated treatment options for migraine prevention, particularly for patients who are highly impacted by their disease.
  
• | Abortive Medications. Numerous abortive medications are used for migraine. The choice for an individual patient depends on the severity of the attacks, associated symptoms, such as severity of pain, incidence of nausea and vomiting, and the patient’s treatment response. Patients most commonly use a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a 5-hydroxytryptamine–1 agonist, or triptan, or a combination of both to abort a migraine. Triptans are most effective when taken early during a migraine and may be repeated in two hours as needed, with a maximum of two doses daily. Triptans are not recommended for use more than three days a week because overuse can lead to increased frequency of migraines and medication overuse headache. Approximately 30% to 50% of patients respond to triptans but there is a high rate of recurrence of migraine within 24 hours. To avoid the development of medication overuse headache, patients are limited to no more than 10 doses of triptans a month, which may be insufficient to treat patients highly impacted with episodic or chronic migraines. This limitation can also be

problematic for migraine patients who suffer from nausea and vomiting and cannot keep triptans in their systems. In addition to these limitations, triptans are also contraindicated for patients with existing, or at risk of, coronary artery disease.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventive Medications. Currently, preventive medications approved for migraine include beta blockers (such as propranolol), topiramate, sodium valproate, botulinum toxin (or Botox) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors. In patients highly impacted with episodic and chronic migraine, beta blockers, topiramate and sodium valproate are commonly used. These medications are often not well-tolerated by many patients because of adverse events such as cognitive impairment, nausea, fatigue and sleep disturbance. In clinical trials, complete responses, or a 100% reduction in migraine days or episodes, with topiramate were less than 6%. In the affected patient population, predominantly women of child-bearing age, the association of these agents with poor pregnancy outcomes and fetal abnormalities can limit their use.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Botox is approved for the prevention of chronic migraine. Approximately 47% of Botox-treated patients experience a 50% reduction in either migraine days per month or migraine frequency per month within six months, which leaves more than half of patients inadequately treated. In Phase 3 clinical trials, no complete responses were reported with Botox. In addition, the dosing regimen requires approximately 31 subcutaneous injections at various sites on the head and neck which is repeated every 12 weeks if the patient has a therapeutic response and it takes two cycles of treatment (24 weeks) to achieve full benefit. 
 Three anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies received FDA approval in 2018 for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults, with data spanning both episodic and chronic migraine:  Amgen’s Aimovig (erenumab), Lilly’s Emgality (galcanezumab) and Teva’s Ajovy (fremanezumab). Each of these agents disrupts CGRP signaling either by binding to the CGRP receptor (Aimovig) or to the CGRP ligand (Ajovy and Emgality), and all are self-administered via subcutaneous injection either monthly (Aimovig, Emgality and Ajovy) or quarterly (Ajovy). In clinical studies, these agents reduced monthly migraine days by 3-5 days, with efficacy documented 1 month following injection. Moreover, 28-50% of patients experienced a 50% reduction in monthly migraine days, either averaged over a three-month period or at month 3, and 59-62% of patients saw similar reductions when averaged over a six-month period. 
 Profound Unmet Medical Need.  Of the approximately 13 million candidates for migraine prevention, approximately 27% have received preventive therapy. Further, nearly 50% of migraineurs have not used a preventative therapy and up to 80% of patients discontinue use within 6 months to a year due to a lack of efficacy and/or occurrence of side effects. As a result, we believe the area of profound unmet need in migraine is for preventive therapies with improved efficacy and tolerability to treat the individuals highly impacted by episodic and chronic migraine. 
 Indications for preventive migraine medications may include: 
  
• | frequency of migraine attacks of four or more per month;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | abortive medications fail or are overused; or
--+----------------------------------------------


• | symptomatic medications (e.g. analgesics or anti-emetics) are contraindicated or ineffective.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that highly impacted patients suffering from episodic and chronic migraine are highly motivated to seek new preventative treatment options that offer improved safety and tolerability, and better efficacy as measured by a material reduction in the number of migraine days experienced, the rapidity with which the migraines are prevented, and infrequent dosing, as compared with current options, which may be associated with safety, tolerability and efficacy limitations. We believe that a therapeutic option that addresses these limitations represents a significant opportunity to improve disease management in a substantial number of patients that are candidates for migraine prevention. 
 Our Migraine Prevention Solution: CGRP and the Science of Eptinezumab.  We are developing eptinezumab for the prevention of migraine, to meet the needs of the estimated 13 million patients in the United States living with migraine that are candidates for a preventative therapy option. Eptinezumab is a monoclonal antibody designed with very high specificity and strong binding for rapid, robust and sustained suppression of CGRP, a small protein and a validated biological target that is understood to drive migraine initiation, maintenance and chronification. Eptinezumab was discovered by Alder scientists and is the result of a deliberate process coupled with proprietary technologies to design a monoclonal antibody inhibiting CGRP. It was designed to provide a competitively differentiated clinical profile to the migraine prevention treatment paradigm and deliver a unique clinical benefit to patients. 
 We believe eptinezumab holds the potential to be a transformative therapeutic and meet a profound medical need, changing the migraine prevention treatment paradigm for physicians and highly impacted patients living with episodic or chronic migraine. We are developing eptinezumab as a fast acting, highly potent, and long-acting therapeutic that modulates the activity of CGRP for the prevention of migraine in highly impacted patients with episodic or chronic migraine.
 Commercial Strategy 
 Assuming eptinezumab administered via infusion is approved by the FDA, we plan to focus our initial commercialization efforts on procedure oriented headache specialists in the United States with a specialty sales force sizing of approximately 75 to 100. We 
 7


believe that these procedure oriented headache specialists comprise neurologists, pain specialists and primary care physicians and treat the highest proportion of the five million to seven million highly impacted patients described above. We estimate this group of procedure oriented headache specialists to number approximately 3,000 physicians.  We believe these physicians have a stronger preference for eptinezumab delivered via infusion vs anti-CGRP options that are self-administered via subcutaneous injection due to the strength of eptinezumab’s clinical profile. We estimate that 94% of these physicians have previously prescribed an infusion therapy for migraine or other conditions.  They administer infusion therapies within practice, hospital or free-standing infusion centers.  They value patient adherence benefits associated with supervised administration by quarterly infusion and they have an infrastructure in place for patient flow, supply and reimbursement.
 We are committed to commercializing eptinezumab in the United States as a migraine prevention therapy, and are focused on capturing the full commercial value of eptinezumab globally. We recognize the potential for strategic partnerships and/or other arrangements that bring additional capabilities and infrastructure, as well as value to the program.  Thus, as a key component of our commercial readiness activities, we are actively reviewing options for partnerships or arrangements that will allow us to realize the commercial potential of eptinezumab outside of the United States. 
 Clinical Trials
 Overview. We believe the clinical data obtained to date in our development program for eptinezumab exhibits the potential of eptinezumab to transform the preventative treatment paradigm for patients living with migraine. We have completed multiple clinical trials evaluating eptinezumab, including two Phase 2 trials in patients with migraine, and a pivotal trial program encompassing two Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials and an open-label Phase 3 clinical trial. Further, we are exploring the initiation of one or more additional clinical studies of our infusion formulation that would, if successful, potentially enable us to broaden the initial label beyond that contemplated by our completed pivotal trials. 
 We initiated our pivotal trial program for eptinezumab in October 2015 with PROMISE 1, a pivotal clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of eptinezumab administered via infusion once every 12 weeks for one year in approximately 888 patients with frequent episodic migraine.  PROMISE 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial in which patients were randomized equally to either one of three doses of eptinezumab or placebo administered via infusion once every 12 weeks across sites in the United States and Europe.  Patient recruitment for PROMISE 1 was completed in October 2016, and top-line data from PROMISE 1 was reported in June 2017.
 In November 2016, Alder initiated a second pivotal clinical trial, PROMISE 2, evaluating the safety and efficacy of eptinezumab in patients with chronic migraine. This study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial that enrolled 1,072 patients randomized to either one of two dose levels of eptinezumab or placebo administered via infusion once every 12 weeks for six months across sites in the United States and Europe. We reported top-line data from PROMISE 2 in January 2018.
 In December 2016, we initiated an open-label Phase 3 clinical trial of eptinezumab to further evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of eptinezumab, as required by the FDA. This study enrolled 118 patients to receive eptinezumab administered by infusion once every 12 weeks for one year.  We completed one year of dosing in the open-label trial in April 2018, generating the required one-year data for our BLA submission. The safety profile in this trial to date is consistent with previous eptinezumab trials, and we elected to extend the trial for another year of dosing. 
 In October 2018, we announced positive results from a comparative pharmacokinetic (PK) study that supported the comparability evaluation of the clinical supply for eptinezumab and its planned commercial supply. The PK study was designed to confirm that the planned commercial supply of eptinezumab had a comparable pharmacokinetic profile to the eptinezumab that was utilized in our clinical trials. Comparative PK profiles were demonstrated between the test and reference products; both the primary and key secondary PK results met the standard pre-specified acceptance criteria for drug product comparability. Further, the test and reference products were well-tolerated with a similar adverse event profile, and this safety profile was consistent with what has previously been reported for eptinezumab.
 PROMISE 2 (Chronic Migraine): This Phase 3 trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized global trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of eptinezumab for chronic migraine prevention. In the study, 1,072 patients were randomized to receive eptinezumab (300mg or 100mg) or placebo administered via infusion once every 3 months for 6 months. To be eligible for the trial, patients must have experienced at least 15 headache days per month, of which at least eight met criteria for migraine. Patients that participated in the trial had an average of 16.1 migraine days per month at baseline. The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in monthly migraine days over the 12-week, double-blind treatment period. Secondary study endpoints assessed through 12 weeks included reduction from baseline (the daily mean migraine prevalence over the 28-day screening period) in daily migraine prevalence on Day 1 and Days 1-28 post-infusion, reductions of > 50%, >75%, and 100% from baseline in mean monthly migraine days, change from baseline in mean monthly acute migraine-specific (triptan or ergotamine) medication days, and reductions from baseline in patient-reported impact scores on the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6). 
 In January 2018, we announced that eptinezumab met primary and all key secondary endpoints with very high statistical significance vs. placebo.  The primary endpoint, demonstrating statistically significant reductions in mean monthly migraine days from baseline (average of approximately 16.1 days) over weeks 1 through 12 was met with a reduction of 8.2 monthly migraine days 
 8


for 300mg (p<0.0001) and 7.7 days for 100mg (p<0.0001) compared to a reduction of 5.6 days for placebo.   The key secondary endpoints and other endpoints met include: 
  
• | Migraine prevalence on Day 1 post-infusion: 52 percent reduction (300mg, p<0.0001) and 50 percent reduction (100mg, p=0.0001) from baseline in migraine risk on Day 1 post-infusion compared to 27 percent for placebo (p-values reflect Day 1 prevalence rate comparison between eptinezumab vs. placebo).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 50% responder rates for weeks 1 through 12: 61.4 percent (300mg, p<0.0001) and 57.6 percent (100mg, p<0.0001) of patients achieved 50 percent or greater reduction in mean monthly migraine days from baseline compared to 39.3 percent for placebo.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 75% responder rates for weeks 1 through 4: 36.9 percent (300mg, p<0.0001) and 30.9 percent (100mg, p<0.0001) of patients achieved a 75 percent or greater reduction in mean monthly migraine days from baseline, compared to 15.6 percent for placebo.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 75% responder rates for weeks 1 through 12: 33.1 percent (300mg, p<0.0001) and 26.7 percent (100mg, p=0.0001) of patients achieved a 75 percent or greater reduction in mean monthly migraine days from baseline, compared to 15.0 percent for placebo.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 100% responder rates for weeks 1 through 12 (post hoc analysis): A 100% reduction in mean monthly migraine days (reducing the number of migraine days per month to 0) was achieved by 15.1 percent (300mg, p<0.0001, unadjusted) and 10.8 percent (100mg, p<0.0001, unadjusted) of patients treated on average, for months 1, 2 and 3, compared to 5.1 percent for placebo.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 All other pre-specified key secondary endpoints were met with very high statistical significance.
 In June 2018, we presented updated data from PROMISE 2 at the American Headache Society 60th Annual Scientific Meeting, including six-month efficacy data.   Reductions in mean monthly migraine days were either sustained or further reduced after a second quarterly infusion, with 8.8 and 8.2 fewer mean monthly migraine days for patients treated with 300mg and 100mg of eptinezumab, respectively, compared to 6.2 fewer mean monthly migraine days for placebo-treated patients. 
 After the second quarterly infusion, a 100% reduction in mean monthly migraine days was achieved by 21 percent (300mg) and 18 percent (100mg) of patients treated on average, for months 4, 5 and 6, compared to 9 percent for placebo. 
 After the second quarterly infusion, 64 percent and 61 percent of patients treated with 300mg or 100mg of eptinezumab, respectively, achieved a 50 percent or greater reduction of mean monthly migraine days from baseline, compared to 44 percent for placebo; and 43 percent and 39 percent of patients treated with 300mg or 100mg of eptinezumab, respectively, achieved a 75 percent or greater reduction of mean monthly migraine days from baseline, compared to 24 percent for placebo-treated patients.
 The observed safety profile in PROMISE 2 was consistent with previously reported eptinezumab studies. Adverse event rates among eptinezumab-treated subjects were similar to placebo-treated subjects. The most commonly reported adverse events for eptinezumab, occurring at an incidence of 2.0% or greater, were nasopharyngitis (6.3 percent), upper respiratory infection (4.0 percent), nausea (3.4 percent) and urinary tract infection (3.1 percent), arthralgia (2.3 percent), dizziness (2.6 percent), anxiety (2.0 percent) and fatigue (2.0 percent).
 PROMISE 1 (Frequent Episodic Migraine): This Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized global trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of eptinezumab for episodic migraine prevention. In the study, 888 patients were randomized to receive eptinezumab (300mg, 100mg or 30mg), or placebo administered by infusion once every 12 weeks for a full year. To be eligible for the trial, patients must have experienced at ≤14 headache days per month, of which at least four met the criteria for migraine. The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in monthly migraine days over the 12-week, double-blind treatment period. Key secondary study endpoints assessed through 12 weeks included reduction from baseline (the daily mean migraine prevalence over the 28-day screening period) in migraine prevalence on Day 1 and reduction of at least 50% and 75% from baseline in mean monthly migraine days.
 In June 2017, we announced that eptinezumab met primary and key secondary endpoints with very high statistical significance vs. placebo. The primary endpoint, demonstrating statistically significant reductions in monthly migraine days from baseline (average of 8.6 days) over weeks 1 through 12 was met with a reduction of 4.3 monthly migraine days for 300mg (p=0.0001) and 3.9 days for 100mg (p=0.0179) compared to an average 3.2 days for placebo. The key secondary endpoints and other endpoints met included:
  
• | Secondary endpoints evaluated over the first 12 weeks following the first quarterly dose include:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Migraine prevalence Day 1 post-infusion: 54.9 percent reduction (300mg, p=0.0087, unadjusted), and 52.3 percent (100mg, p=0.0167, unadjusted) in migraine risk from baseline on Day 1 post-infusion compared to 24.5 percent for placebo.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 50% responder rates for weeks 1 through 12: 56.3 percent (300mg, p=0.0001) and 49.8 percent (100mg, p=0.0085, unadjusted) of patients achieved 50 percent or greater reduction in monthly migraine days from baseline compared to 37.4 percent for placebo.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 75% responder rates for weeks 1 through 4: 31.5 percent (300mg, p=0.0066) and 30.8 percent (100mg, p=0.0112) of patients achieved 75 percent or greater reduction in monthly migraine days from baseline compared to 20.3 percent for placebo. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 75% responder rates for weeks 1 through 12: 29.7 percent (300mg, p=0.0007) and 22.2 percent (100mg, not statistically significant) of patients achieved 75 percent or greater reduction in monthly migraine days from baseline compared to 26.2 percent for placebo.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Secondary endpoints demonstrated an increase in efficacy following a second quarterly dose of eptinezumab:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 75% responder rates for weeks 13 through 24: 40.1 percent (300mg, p=0.0006) and 33.5 percent (100mg, p=0.0434, unadjusted) of patients achieved 75 percent or greater reduction in monthly migraine days from baseline compared to 24.8 percent for placebo.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 100% responder rates for weeks 1 through 24 (post hoc analysis): A 100% reduction in monthly migraine days (reducing the number of migraine days per month to 0) was achieved by 24.5 percent (300mg) and 19.7 percent (100mg) of patients treated on average, for months 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, compared to 14.3 percent for placebo.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In June 2018, we presented updated data from PROMISE 1 at the American Headache Society 60th Annual Scientific Meeting, including year-long efficacy data.  After the first quarterly infusion, patients with episodic migraine treated with 300mg or 100mg of eptinezumab experienced 4.3 and 3.9 fewer monthly migraine days, from a baseline of 8.5 monthly migraine days, compared to 3.2 fewer monthly migraine days for placebo-treated patients (p value = 0.0001 for 300mg and 0.0182 for 100mg). At one year after the third and fourth quarterly infusions, patients treated with 300mg or 100mg of eptinezumab experienced further gains in efficacy with 5.3 and 4.5 fewer monthly migraine days, respectively, from baseline compared to 4.1 fewer monthly migraine days for placebo-treated patients. 
 After the third and fourth quarterly infusions, a 100% reduction in monthly migraine days was achieved by 31 percent (300mg) and 27 percent (100mg) of patients treated on average, for months 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, compared to 21 percent for placebo.
 At one year after the third and fourth infusions, 70 percent and 65 percent of patients treated with 300mg or 100mg of eptinezumab, respectively, achieved 50 percent or greater reduction of monthly migraine days from baseline over a full 3 months, compared to 55 percent for placebo; and 54 percent and 39 percent of patients treated with 300mg or 100mg of eptinezumab, respectively, achieved 75 percent or greater reduction of monthly migraine days from baseline over a full 3 months, compared to 23 percent for placebo.
 The observed safety profile in PROMISE 1 was consistent with previously reported eptinezumab studies. Adverse event rates among eptinezumab-treated subjects were similar to placebo-treated subjects. The most commonly reported adverse events for eptinezumab, occurring at an incidence of 2.0% or greater, were upper respiratory tract infection (10.5 percent), nasopharyngitis (6.8 percent), sinusitis (3.6 percent), dizziness (3.3 percent), fatigue (3.2 percent), nausea (2.9 percent), bronchitis (2.7 percent), cough (2.3 percent), diarrhea (2.3 percent), influenza (2.3 percent) and back pain (2.1 percent). 
 Phase 2b Clinical Trial (Chronic Migraine). This Phase 2b clinical trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, single intravenous infusion, dose ranging study in 588 patients with chronic migraine. Patients were randomized to receive a single intravenous infusion of 10mg, 30mg, 100mg or 300mg of eptinezumab or placebo (approximately 120 patients per group). The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the change in migraine days between eptinezumab and placebo as determined by the 75% responder rates over a 12-week period.  Endpoints were also evaluated at week 24 and at week 48 (study end).  In March 2016, we announced the following positive top-line data from the trial:

• | The 300mg and 100mg dose levels of eptinezumab met the primary efficacy endpoint of the study, a 75% reduction in migraine days over the entire 12 weeks in 33% and 31% of patients, respectively (p < 0.05) compared to 21% for placebo.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A single administration of eptinezumab resulted in an immediate and persistent mean reduction in migraine days from baseline throughout the 12 weeks at the 300mg (p < 0.01), 100mg (p < 0.01), and 30mg (p < 0.01) dose levels compared to placebo, meeting the secondary efficacy endpoint.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A single administration of eptinezumab at 300mg, 100mg or 30mg dose levels demonstrated a persistent reduction in migraine days for the entire 12 weeks, supporting a quarterly dosing strategy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 10


 
• | The 10mg dose of eptinezumab was identified as sub-therapeutic.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | The safety profile was consistent with that observed in earlier eptinezumab clinical trials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In July 2016, we announced that top-line 24-week data from this trial demonstrated persistent migraine prevention in patients with chronic migraine, confirming and extending the 12-week data announced in March 2016. The 75% responder rate for the entire 24 weeks at the 300mg, 100mg and 30mg dose levels was 31%, 29% and 30%, respectively, compared to a placebo rate of 20%. Eptinezumab also demonstrated a persistent mean reduction in migraine days from baseline throughout the 24-week period.  The statistical analysis plan for the Phase 2b trial did not provide for analyses of statistical significance at time points after the primary endpoint at 12 weeks. 
 A post-hoc analysis of the data demonstrated that within 24 hours after eptinezumab administration there was more than a 50% reduction in the percentage of patients experiencing a migraine after receiving eptinezumab versus baseline, compared to a 17% reduction in patients administered placebo. An analysis of the data also demonstrated that this rapid reduction in migraine days and significant separation between those patients receiving eptinezumab versus placebo was maintained at four weeks after administration.
 Completed Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept Clinical Trial (Frequent Episodic Migraine).  Our first completed Phase 2 clinical trial of eptinezumab was a single 1000mg intravenous infusion dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized proof-of-concept trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of eptinezumab in patients with frequent episodic migraine. Approximately 80 patients each received one dose of eptinezumab in the clinical trial. 
 The primary endpoint for our proof-of-concept trial was the difference between eptinezumab and placebo in the change of mean migraine days per month from baseline to weeks five through eight following one dose of eptinezumab. In this trial, one dose of eptinezumab produced a rapid and persistent reduction in migraine days that was statistically significant when compared to placebo, in terms of both change in migraine days per month (p=0.03) and the magnitude of the change in migraine days prevented across all patients (p<0.001) at the primary endpoint of eight weeks. The reduction in migraine days per month was also statistically significant across the entire combined three-month trial period (p=0.0078). 
 In addition to reduction of mean migraine days per month as an efficacy endpoint, a responder analysis was performed with 16% of patients receiving a single dose of eptinezumab achieving a complete 100% response (zero migraine days) versus 0% on placebo over the entire 12-week period following infusion. In any four-week period of the trial (weeks 1-4, 5-8 or 9-12), approximately 75% of patients achieved a >50% reduction, 45% or more achieved a >75% reduction and 27% or more achieved a 100% reduction in migraine days. Eptinezumab provided a statistically significant reduction in migraines days versus placebo over the entire three-month period of the trial (p<0.001).
 Eptinezumab was well-tolerated and adverse events were comparable in terms of type and frequency across eptinezumab and placebo groups. In addition, there were no meaningful differences between the eptinezumab treatment and placebo groups with respect to adverse events, cardiovascular measures or laboratory safety data. 
 Patients in this trial were followed for an additional three months for a total of six months (24 weeks) follow-up. The percentage of patients achieving a >50, >75 or 100% response for the entire 24-week duration of follow-up was similar to that observed for the first 12 weeks, suggesting that the response to a single dose of eptinezumab was persistent and long lasting. 
 Phase 1 Clinical Trials.  We have completed various Phase 1 clinical trials of eptinezumab, including a Phase 1 clinical trial demonstrating that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics by infusion, subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of eptinezumab support a quarterly single injection dosing strategy. 
 ALD1910
 ALD1910 is a high specificity, high affinity neutralizing monoclonal antibody discovered and designed by Alder with reactivity to pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38, or PACAP-38.  PACAP has emerged as an important signaling molecule in the pathophysiology of migraine and represents an attractive novel target for treating migraine. New evidence indicates that PACAP may represent a unique and distinct pathway associated with migraine. Preclinical data indicate that PACAP and CGRP may have non-overlapping pharmacology with respect to migraine-associated symptoms.  PACAP and its three known receptors (PAC1, VPAC1 and VPAC2) are expressed in the regions of the brain known to be associated with migraine symptomatology. By blocking the ligand, ALD1910 prevents the signaling of PACAP by all three receptors, since they are all associated with migraine symptoms.  
 We recently completed preclinical studies showing ALD1910 was effective in blocking the effects of endogenous PACAP, in a dose-dependent manner, in an animal model of neurogenic vasodilation. We believe this further validates our view in developing new therapies that blocking the ligand versus blocking only one involved receptor is likely to be a more effective approach to treating migraine disease.
 We believe ALD1910 holds potential as a migraine treatment and could provide an important new therapeutic option to migraine patients and their physicians. We are advancing ALD1910 through toxicology studies to enable Phase 1 studies, which we expect to initiate by the end of 2019 and subsequently support an IND with the FDA.

Preclinical Pipeline 
 We are working to expand our antibody therapeutic pipeline in opportunities where our technology provides favorable development advantage in areas of unmet medical need, seeking both first-in-class and best-in-class therapeutics. We prioritize targets that meet the criteria of either genetic validation or clinical demonstration that they play a central role in the disease state. We are continuing to evaluate additional potential candidates that represent diverse opportunities in indications that may be eligible for orphan designations and/or indications where monoclonal antibodies have not previously played a role in the treatment paradigm, such as was the case with our eptinezumab program for migraine prevention. 
Out-Licensed Product Candidate 
 In May 2016, we licensed the exclusive worldwide rights for clazakizumab, another product candidate internally developed by Alder, to Vitaeris, Inc., or Vitaeris, based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Clazakizumab is a novel monoclonal antibody that inhibits the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), an important driver of the inflammatory response. IL-6 is also implicated in the transition from acute to chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation is a notable feature of several diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis. Clazakizumab completed two positive Phase 2b clinical studies establishing proof-of-concept for RA.
 In exchange for the rights to clazakizumab, we received an equity interest in Vitaeris and are eligible to receive royalties and certain other payments.  In November 2017, Vitaeris and its shareholders, including Alder, entered into a strategic collaboration and purchase option agreement with a third party, CSL Limited, to expedite the development of clazakizumab as a therapeutic option for solid organ transplant rejection.
 Technology Platform 
 We built and use a proprietary antibody platform to discover and develop monoclonal antibody therapeutics that enables us to engineer our candidates to have properties that we believe optimize the therapeutic potential for patients. Since the unique structure, including sequence, of an antibody determines how it functions and behaves, we specifically engineer our candidates to have properties aligned with the desired therapeutic profile. Leveraging this proprietary platform, we select for properties that we consider important in order to optimize safety, tolerability and efficacy. We further select for properties that support reduced dosing volumes and frequency, time to onset of therapeutic effect, route of administration flexibility, reduced immunogenicity compared to other monoclonal antibody therapeutics, and other benefits. The specific monoclonal antibody properties that we consider important to optimize in the selection and development of our candidates to support best-in-class target therapeutic profiles include:

• | Bioavailability
--+----------------


• | Binding affinity and specificity
--+---------------------------------


• | Half-life
--+----------


• | Immunogenicity
--+---------------


• | Manufacturing efficiency
--+-------------------------


• | Formulation properties
--+-----------------------

 Our proprietary platform consists of three components that we believe together allows us to optimize the discovery and selection of monoclonal antibody product candidates with the specific, pre-defined, properties that confer best-in-class therapeutic potential for patients:
  
• | Antibody selection (ABS): our proprietary antibody selection platform that provides access to diverse antibody collections that meet our therapeutic target profile and provides access to optimal properties of high affinity and selectivity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A pioneering process we developed that humanizes rabbit antibodies to produce therapeutic antibodies that are greater than 95% human. Unlike fully-human antibodies, our antibodies are designed to lack certain sugars in an effort to minimize the body’s recognition of such antibodies as foreign, thereby limiting infusion reactions as well as maximizing durability of the therapeutic response.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our yeast-based proprietary manufacturing technology, MabXpress.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 We also believe these technologies allow us to address a number of critical development priorities early, thereby reducing our development cost and timeline. 
  Antibody Discovery and Candidate Selection Technology 
 Antibodies are produced by the immune system in humans and other warm-blooded animals. They are naturally generated to help defend and protect from disease and infections. Antibodies are produced and secreted by specialized antibody producing cells 
 12


called B cells. Traditionally, rodents have been used as the source of therapeutic antibodies. To find these antibodies, we remove the B cells from the spleen and fuse to a cancer cell. The combined cancer and B cell, or “hybridoma,” is able to live longer from this host than normal B cells would alone. Generally, this process has trouble recovering an antibody with the desired properties due to its low overall efficiency. Collectively, this limits the ability to identify high-quality antibody therapeutics with optimal therapeutic properties. 
 We discover all of our product candidates in-house with our ABS technology. As a precursor to discovery, we choose to target freely-circulating proteins, such as ligands, which are critical to the disease biology and are part of well understood disease pathways. We believe this strategy can lead to fewer drug doses at lower concentrations, while potentially minimizing off target activity and associated side-effects. The clinical relevance of these proteins is highly validated by prior scientific or clinical research. 
 Our ABS technology has been successfully applied to a wide cross section of therapeutic targets that range from small biologically active peptides to more traditional monoclonal antibody targets. ABS allows us to rapidly evaluate all the B cells in a host and identify the key subset of cells that produce the antibody responsible for the desired therapeutic effect. We believe one of our competitive advantages is our proprietary method to keep these B cells alive while we exhaustively screen them. This is an iterative process that allows us to identify the rare antibodies that possess the ideal qualities needed to be a successful therapeutic, for example manufacturability, therapeutic stability, durability and favorable safety. 
 Our ABS technology has been applied in all our preclinical and clinical programs and led to the selection of eptinezumab, ALD1910 and clazakizumab. We also use our ABS technology to provide bio-analytical support for all our product candidates in the clinic. 
 Antibody Humanization and Therapeutic Design 
 Antibodies derived from non-human sources elicit a natural rejection response, and if left unchanged when injected into humans, are removed rapidly and quickly lose their therapeutic effect. Common sources of antibodies include mice and rats, which have antibodies that are structurally different from humans and need to be altered to be more human-like. 
 Historically, this is a complex and difficult undertaking to convert rodent antibodies into human therapeutics that retain all the original rodent antibody properties. This is a highly iterative process that is both time and labor intensive and is fraught with significant failure. 
 We have pioneered the use of rabbit antibodies as the starting materials for our product candidates. Compared to rodent antibody humanization, our rabbit antibody humanization results in more human-like antibodies that maintain their original properties and are faster to produce. As a result, our process requires fewer iterations to complete humanization. Using our proprietary technology, we consistently generate antibody therapeutics that are greater than 95% human in terms of their sequence content. However, unlike fully-human antibodies, we specifically design our antibodies to lack certain sugars in order to further minimize the body’s recognition of such antibodies as foreign, thereby limiting infusion reactions, as well as maximizing durability of the therapeutic response. Our technology results in product candidates that are well-tolerated by patients. 
 Our product candidates are also differentiated from most other monoclonal antibodies based on our use of an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) backbone. While all therapeutic antibodies use an immunoglobulin backbone, there are four different IgG subclasses. We believe that the use of IgG1, in combination with our decision to engineer our antibodies to remove certain sugars from the backbone, improves certain therapeutic characteristics, including reduced immunogenicity and improved half-life.
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success will significantly depend upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for our product candidates and antibody platform. For the specific antibody product candidates in all of our programs, we seek to protect the candidate antibody and variants thereof, compositions containing the antibody, methods of manufacturing the antibody, and the use of the antibody in treating human disease conditions where we or any future partner is actively pursuing, or contemplate pursuing regulatory approval permitting the marketing of the antibody for use as a human therapeutic agent. In addition to pursuing patent protection for our key technologies, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. 
 We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees and selected consultants. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to protect competitive advantages. For more information, see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”

Technology Licenses 
 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.
 In January 2018, we entered into a European patent settlement and global license agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals International GmbH, or Teva GmbH. The agreement resolved our appeal following opposition proceedings before the European Patent Office, or EPO, related to Teva GmbH’s European Patent No. 1957106 B1, with respect to CGRP antagonist antibodies, and provided clarity regarding our freedom to develop, manufacture and commercialize eptinezumab. Under the terms of the agreement, we received a non-exclusive license to Teva GmbH’s CGRP patent portfolio, which includes the opposed European patent, to develop, manufacture and commercialize eptinezumab in the United States and worldwide, excluding Japan and Korea. While the agreement does not provide us with a license for Japan and Korea, we believe we have freedom to develop, manufacture and commercialize eptinezumab in these countries. In exchange for the license, we agreed to withdraw our appeal before the EPO; make an immediate one-time payment of $25 million to Teva GmbH, which we made in January 2018; make a second one-time payment of $25 million upon the approval of a BLA for eptinezumab with the FDA or of an earlier equivalent filing with a regulatory authority elsewhere in the license territory in which any Teva GmbH licensed patents exist; and pay $75 million at each of two sales-related milestones (at $1 billion and $2 billion in annual sales) and provide certain royalty payments on net sales at rates from 5% to 7% following the commercial launch of eptinezumab. 
Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences 
 In October 2004, we entered into a royalty-free license agreement with Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences, or Keck, under which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to Keck’s patent rights in certain inventions, or the Keck patent rights, and technology or the Keck technology, related to production and optimization of antibodies in yeast, including certain patents relating to our ABS and MabXpress technologies. Under the license agreement, we are permitted to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products using the Keck patent rights for all research and commercial uses, and to sublicense such rights. Keck retained the right, on behalf of itself and other non-profit institutions, to use the Keck patent rights and Keck technology for educational and research purposes and to publish information about the Keck patent rights and to further use the Keck technology for purposes other than production and optimization of antibodies in yeast. 
  In consideration for the rights granted to us under the license agreement, we issued Keck an aggregate of 40,000 shares of our common stock. As additional consideration, we are required to pay an annual license maintenance fee during the term of the agreement. 
 The license agreement requires that we use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize one or more products that are covered by the Keck patent rights. We may terminate the license agreement upon 30 days’ notice to Keck. Either party may terminate the license agreement in the event of material breach of the license agreement which remains uncured after 90 days of receiving written notice of such breach. Absent early termination, the license agreement will automatically terminate on a country-by-country basis upon the expiration date of the longest-lived patent right included in the Keck patent rights. 
 Other 
 We also license intellectual property from certain other parties that we believe to be useful for the conduct of our business and may enter into additional license agreements in the future. 
Manufacturing 
 We have adopted a manufacturing strategy of contracting with a variety of contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, within North America and Europe for the manufacture of eptinezumab, ALD1910, and future product candidates. This has enabled us to produce products under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, controls for our completed and planned clinical trials. A protocol of methods has been established at these manufacturers along with specific testing facilities to generate sufficient information to inform the appropriate regulatory authorities. We historically relied on a single smaller scale CMO to manufacture and provide us with clinical supplies of eptinezumab.  We have entered into agreements with other CMOs to manufacture eptinezumab drug 
 15


substance or drug product at larger scale to execute our clinical trials as well as meet our forecasted demand as we prepare for commercialization.  
 Sandoz GmbH. We entered into an agreement with Sandoz GmbH, or Sandoz, effective May 2015, pursuant to which Sandoz will manufacture and supply certain guaranteed quantities of eptinezumab drug substance.  We anticipate that such guaranteed capacities will be sufficient to support the commercial launch of eptinezumab and beyond, if approved.  Pursuant to an amendment to this agreement that became effective January 1, 2019, Sandoz’s obligation to provide such guaranteed capacity extends through termination of the agreement on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2023 (but only if Sandoz has manufactured and delivered the guaranteed capacity) or (ii) the date that Sandoz has manufactured and delivered such guaranteed capacity.  We are obligated to make reservation payments in exchange for such guaranteed capacity.  The agreement, as amended, is subject to certain rights of the parties to terminate earlier, including in the event of uncured material breach, lack of regulatory approval or the discontinuation of the development and/or commercialization of eptinezumab.  We expect to enter into additional CMO relationships for our eptinezumab commercial supply needs as well as for our other product candidates.
 Competition 
 The development and commercialization of new therapeutic products is highly competitive. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop and manage products that are safer, more efficacious and/or more cost-effective than alternative therapies. We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of biosimilar products, which are expected to become available over the coming years. Many of our competitors are large pharmaceutical companies that will have a greater ability to reduce prices for their competing drugs in an effort to gain market share and undermine the value proposition that we might otherwise be able to offer to payors, which could result in our product candidates being excluded from payor formularies. In addition, payors could require patients to have tried and failed our competitors’ products before they provide reimbursement for our product candidates, which could shrink the market size for our product candidates. 
 Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Many of these competitors are attempting to develop therapeutics for our target indications. 
 Eptinezumab, if approved, will compete with three CGRP inhibiting therapies that received FDA approval in 2018 for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults, with data spanning both episodic and chronic migraine:  Amgen’s Aimovig (erenumab), Lilly’s Emgality (galcanezumab) and Teva’s Ajovy (fremanezumab). Each of these agents disrupts CGRP signaling either by binding to the CGRP receptor (Aimovig) or to the CGRP ligand (Ajovy and Emgality), and all are self-administered via subcutaneous injection either monthly (Aimovig, Emgality and Ajovy) or quarterly (Ajovy). While we believe that there is a significant opportunity for eptinezumab, our penetration could be limited by the availability of these therapies, which will have been on the market well in advance of eptinezumab if approved.  Eptinezumab will also compete with beta blockers that are approved for prevention of episodic and chronic migraine such as propranolol, marketed by Wyeth, and other treatments such as topiramate, marketed by Johnson & Johnson, and sodium valproate, marketed by Divalproex. In addition, Botox, marketed by Allergan, is approved for the prevention of chronic migraine. We are also aware of several oral small-molecule CGRP inhibiting therapies currently in development that if approved could compete with eptinezumab, including Allergan’s atogepant and Biohaven’s rimegepant and BHV‑3500.  Patients also may be elect to use cheaper generic abortive medications such as triptans, which could limit eptinezumab market penetration in the migraine prevention marketplace. 
 The commercial opportunity for eptinezumab or our other product candidates could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, more convenient or less expensive than our product candidates or any other product candidate that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in many cases insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products. 
 We believe that eptinezumab has potential benefits over competitive products as described under “—Our Pipeline.” As a result, we believe that eptinezumab should be well placed to capture market share from competing products if approved. However, even with those benefits, eptinezumab may be unable to compete successfully against these products. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to eptinezumab and Our Other Product Candidates.” 
 Government Regulation 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of biopharmaceutical products. These agencies and other 
 16


federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, distribution record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. 
 The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | submission of an IND which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities for their compliance with cGMP and selected clinical investigations for their compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA approval of a BLA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial by imposing a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Furthermore, an independent institutional review board for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial commences at that center. Regulatory authorities or an institutional review board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include a data safety monitoring board, which receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may recommend that the sponsor halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. 
  For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. 
  
• | Phase 1—Studies are initially conducted to test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—Studies are conducted with groups of patients with a specified disease or condition to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—Clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4—The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 BLA Submission and Review by the FDA 
 The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial User Fee to the FDA. Within sixty days of a BLA’s submission, the FDA makes a determination whether to accept the BLA for filing, if it finds that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review.  If not accepted for filing, a refusal-to-file letter is issued and the BLA submission process must be restarted by the applicant. The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Once the BLA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA typically takes one year from submission to review the application and respond to the applicant, which can take the form of either a Complete Response Letter or Approval. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for 
 17


additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. FDA approval of any BLA submitted by us will be at a time the FDA chooses. Also, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the BLA. 
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use. 
 Healthcare Regulation 
 Our sales, promotion, medical education and other activities following product approval, and certain activities prior to approval, are and will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and state and local governments. Our current and future business activities, including our future promotional and scientific/educational programs, may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, patient data privacy and security, and physician sunshine laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. 
 Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet these applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, imprisonment, integrity obligations, the curtailment of our operations, diminished profits or future earnings, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of pharmaceutical products, when and if approved for marketing, depend significantly on the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, and significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.  In addition, payors may only elect to coverage to a subset of competing drug products in a class.  This has been observed with the three anti-CGRP therapies that received FDA approval in 2018 for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults, with certain payors only providing coverage for two of the three therapies.
 In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor not to 
 18


cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Coverage and adequate reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Health Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA.  Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our business are that it: created an annual fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extended a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; and created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program.  Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump signed two Executive Orders and other directives to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance and delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included the Budget Control Act of 2011, which caused aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year effective April 1, 2013 which, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, as well as other legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.
 There has also been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices.  Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.  For example, at the federal level, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute discount safe harbor for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations. While some of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. 
 Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. 
 19


In the European Union, or EU, member states require both regulatory clearances by the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical trial. Under the EU regulatory systems, marketing authorization applications may be submitted under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. It is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes. Because our products are produced in that way, we would be subject to the centralized process. Under the centralized procedure, pharmaceutical companies submit a single marketing authorization application to the EMA. Once granted by the European Commission, a centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU member states, as well as the EEA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. By law, a company can only start to market a medicine once it has received a marketing authorization.
