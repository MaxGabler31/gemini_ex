Marquis’s product offering has remained on the cutting edge of this rapidly evolving segment of the flooring industry and will continue to be an innovator in new technology and design. The 16 running line products currently offered include dry back and click luxury vinyl plank along with WPC and SPC rigid core tile and plank. In addition, Marquis Hard Surfaces also features hundreds of rolls of vinyl specials at promotional prices.
Yarns
 
Through its A-O Division, Marquis uses state-of-the-art yarn extrusion capacity to market monofilament textured yarn products to the artificial turf industry. As described above, the A-O Division was sold to a third party on December 21, 2018.
Industry and Market
 
Marquis is an integrated carpet manufacturer, seller of hard surface products and manufacturer of nylon and polypropylene monofilament turf yarn within a fragmented industry composed of a wide variety of companies from small privately held firms to large multinationals. In 2017, the U.S. floor covering industry had an estimated $25.5 billion in sales.
 
Floor covering sales are influenced by the homeowner remodeling and residential builder markets, existing home sales and housing starts, average house size and home ownership. In addition, the level of sales in the floor covering industry is influenced by consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, the condition of residential and commercial construction, and overall strength of the economy.
 
Our Market
 
Carpet and Rugs
 
The carpet and rug industry had shipments of $11.8 billion in 2017. The carpet and rugs industry has two primary markets, residential and commercial, with the residential market making up the largest portion of the industry. The industry has two primary sub-markets, replacement and new construction, with the replacement market making up the larger portion of the sub-markets. Approximately 61% of industry shipments are made in response to residential replacement demand.

Residential products consist of broadloom carpets and rugs in a broad range of styles, colors and textures. Commercial products consist primarily of broadloom carpet and modular carpet tile for a variety of institutional applications including office buildings, restaurant chains, schools and other commercial establishments. The carpet industry also manufactures carpet for the automotive, recreational vehicle, small boat and other industries.
 
The Carpet and Rug Institute (the “CRI”) is the national trade association representing carpet and rug manufacturers. Information compiled by the CRI suggests that the domestic carpet and rug industry is comprised of fewer than 100 manufacturers, with a meaningful percentage of the industry's production concentrated in a limited number of manufacturers focused on the lower end of the price curve.
 
Hard Surfaces
 
Hard flooring surfaces such as ceramic, luxury vinyl tile, hardwood, stone, and laminate had shipments of $13.9 billion in 2017. As with carpet and rugs, the market is split between residential and commercial and replacement and new construction, with residential replacement being the largest segment of the market.
Synthetic Turf
 
Northwest Georgia is also the home to a thriving synthetic turf industry, a relative of the carpet industry. Early versions of artificial turf, or fake grass, in domed and open-air sports stadiums used to be referred to as Astro Turf by the athletes who played upon the turf. Today, artificial turf is more akin to a manmade organism, with advanced underlay, cushioning, and drainage systems. AstroTurf, the granddaddy of artificial turf, is headquartered in Dalton, GA.
 
Other major turf players in Georgia include Challenger Industries, Controlled Products, Synthetic Turf Resources, Fieldturf, and Turf Store. Marquis, through its A-O Industries division, has developed significant yarn extrusion expertise and services the synthetic turf industry through the sale of highest quality yarns. As discussed above, Marquis sold its A-O Division to a third party on December 21, 2018.
 
Competition
 
The North American flooring industry is highly competitive with an increasing variety of product categories, shifting consumer preferences and pressures from imported products, particularly in the rug and hard surface categories. Marquis competes with other flooring manufacturers and resellers. Marquis is a fully integrated carpet mill, and, as a result, is able to produce carpet at the lowest cost possible for its target price point. Marquis is a one stop shop for soft and hard surface products, allowing its customers to save time and receive exceptional service. Marquis offers innovative products and has quick turnaround times turning a new product in two weeks from order to delivery. The principal methods of competition are service, quality, price, product innovation and technology. Marquis’ lean operating structure plus investments in manufacturing equipment, computer systems and marketing strategy contribute to its ability to provide exceptional value on the basis of performance, quality, style and service, rather than just competing on price.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
Our principal suppliers include Honeywell, DAK, Syntec, Global Backing, and Mattex. We believe that we will have access to an adequate supply of raw material on satisfactory commercial terms for the foreseeable future. We are not dependent on any one supplier.

Customers
 
Marquis sells products to flooring dealers, home centers, other flooring manufacturers and directly to end users. Approximately 70% of sales are to a network of over 2,000 flooring dealers across several different end markets, geographies, and product lines. Management believes that the dealer market is the most profitable market for its products because it’s a diversified customer base that values innovation, style, and service. Dealer networks typically allow Marquis to achieve higher margin, lower volume accounts. As a result, we are not dependent on any one customer to sustain our revenue.
Manufacturing
 
Marquis has a manufacturing facility with state-of-the-art equipment in all phases of its vertically integrated production, from extrusion of yarn to yarn processing to tufting carpet. Marquis manufactures high quality products and offer unique customization with exceptionally short lead-times. Marquis has recently invested in new, efficient equipment to expand it yarn extrusion capacity to enter new markets. The new equipment allows Marquis to reduce production costs and increase margins. Marquis has existing capacity to grow sales by 25% without additional investment.
Marketing
 
Marquis has a team of 29 full-time salespeople who deepen customer relationships throughout its markets.

ApplianceSmart
 
At September 30, 2018, ApplianceSmart operated seventeen stores: six in the Minneapolis/St. Paul market; one in Rochester, Minnesota; four in the Columbus, Ohio market; four in the Atlanta, Georgia market; and two in the San Antonio, Texas market.  ApplianceSmart is a major household appliance retailer with two product categories: one consisting of typical and commonly available, innovative appliances, and the other consisting of affordable value-priced, niche offerings such as close-outs, factory overruns, discontinued models, and special-buy appliances, including open box merchandise and others.  One example of a special-buy appliance may be due to manufacturer product redesign, in which a current model is updated to include a few new features and is then assigned a new model number. Because the major manufacturers—primarily Whirlpool, General Electric, and Electrolux—ship only the latest models to retailers, a large quantity of the previous models often remain in the manufacturers' inventories. Special-buy appliances typically are not integrated into the manufacturers’ normal distribution channels and require a different method of management, which we provide. For many years, manufacturers relied on small appliance dealers to buy these specialty products to sell in their stores.  However, today small retailers are struggling to compete with large appliance chains as the ten largest retailers of major appliances account for more than 85% of the sales volume.  At the same time, expansion of big-box retailers that sell appliances has created an increase in the number of special-buy units, further straining the traditional outlet system for these appliances. Because these special-buy appliances have value, manufacturers and retailers need an efficient management system to recover their worth.
 
ApplianceSmart has entered into contracts for purchasing appliances that it sells in ApplianceSmart stores and in its commercial contracts.  These contracts and arrangements are with the following five major manufacturers:
 

1. | Electrolux
---+-----------


2. | GE Appliances
---+--------------


3. | LG
---+---


4. | Samsung
---+--------


5. | Whirlpool
---+----------

 
There are no guarantees on the number of units any of the manufacturers will sell us. However, we believe purchases from these manufacturers will provide an adequate supply of high-quality appliances for our ApplianceSmart stores and our commercial division.
 
Key components of our current agreements include:
 

1. | We have no guarantees for the number or type of appliances that we purchase. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | The agreements may be terminated by either party with 30 days’ prior written notice. 
3. | We have agreed to indemnify certain manufacturers for certain claims, allegations or losses concerning the appliances we sell.

Our Market
 
Vintage Stock. According to the Entertainment Software Association, today’s video games provide rich, engaging entertainment for players across all platforms. The 2018 Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry Report (the “Video Game Industry Report”) underscores how video games have evolved into a mass medium, noting that more than 150 million Americans play video games, and 64 percent of American households are home to at least one person who plays video games regularly, or at least three hours per week and 60 percent of Americans play video games daily. In addition, the Video Game Industry Report also stated that in 2016, the industry sold over 24.5 billion games and generated more than $30.4 billion in revenue. Total game sales included purchases of digital content such as online subscriptions, downloadable content, mobile applications, and social networking games.  Total consumer spending in the video game industry reached $36 billion in 2017, representing an 18% rise over 2016’s $30.4 billion, per recent data released by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) and The NPD Group. These figures include mobile spending data, provided by App Annie, which include paid downloads and in-game purchases for mobile and tablet devices through Apple’s App Store and Google Play. Separately, two-thirds (66%) of Americans ages 13 and older self-identify as gamers, up from 58% in 2013, according to a Nielsen study. Gamers are spending an average of 11% of their leisure time with video games this year, a figure that has remained largely consistently over the past few years, per Nielsen’s data.

ApplianceSmart. The U.S. major appliance industry is increasing, growing by 2.9% over the course of the last five years and is expected to reach $19 billion in 2018, according to IBISWorld. The Company also believes that the market is undergoing a significant advancement of “smart” or “connected” appliances. According to Grand View Research, manufacturers are investing substantially in research and development in the connected appliance space. With integrated computer chip and screens in refrigerators, consumers can sync up grocery lists, recipes, and even play a Pandora playlist through their appliance. According to Statista, these so called “smart appliances” generated approximately $887 million in 2016, which is a significant increase over 2011 (approximately $105 million). According to Grand View Research, the two major distribution channels for consumers to purchase appliances are brick and mortal retail and ecommerce. Brick and mortar retail holds the majority share in revenue and the Company believes will continue to increase through 2025. 
 
Competition
 
 Vintage Stock. Our industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. Competition is based on the ability to adopt new technology, aggressive franchising, establishment of brand names and quality of collections. The markets where we have a presence do not have many establishments that sell video games. For example, 0.6% of total video game retailers are in Oklahoma. In addition, although many competitors have entered the rental industry with streaming online content, the lack of broadband throughout the United States, particularly in the Midwest, has protected retailers of movies. Six of the seven states where Vintage Stock operates are among the 10 states with the slowest internet speed. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains; computer product and consumer electronics stores; other video game and PC software specialty stores; toy retail chains; direct sales by software publishers; and online retailers and game rental companies. We have, however, established a presence in areas where we can take a greater portion of market share. Video game products are also distributed through other methods such as digital delivery. We also compete with sellers of pre-owned and value video game products. Additionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment activities, including casual and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers.
 
ApplianceSmart. Our competition comes mainly from new-appliance and other special-buy retailers. Each ApplianceSmart store competes with local and national retail appliance chains, as well as with independently owned retailers. Many of these retailers have been in business longer than us and may have significantly greater assets. Many factors, including obtaining adequate resources to create and support the infrastructure required to operate large-scale appliance recycling and replacement programs, affect competition in the industry. 
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties. We currently rely primarily on a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and similar measures to protect our intellectual property.
 
We estimate that reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how will continue to be our principal method of protecting our trade secrets and other proprietary technologies. While we have hired third-party contractors to help develop our proprietary software and to provide various fulfillment services, we generally own (or have permissive licenses for) the intellectual property provided by these contractors. Our proprietary software is not substantially dependent on any third-party software, although our software does utilize open source code. Notwithstanding the use of this open source code, we do not believe our usage requires public disclosure of our own source code nor do we believe the use of open source code will have a material impact on our business.

We register some of our product names, slogans and logos in the United States. In addition, we generally require our employees, contractors and many of those with whom we have business relationships to sign non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements. Neither intellectual property laws, contractual arrangements, nor any of the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property, can ensure that third parties will not exploit our technologies or develop similar technologies.
 
Our proprietary publishing system provides an advanced set of integrated tools for design, service, and modifications to support our mobile web app services. Our mobile web app builder software enables easy and efficient design, end user modification and administration, and includes a variety of other tools accessible by our team members.
 
Services Segment
 
We continue to generate revenue from servicing our existing customers under our legacy product offerings, primarily our InstantProfile® line of products and services. These services primarily consist of directory listing services. Because of the change in our business strategy and product lines, we no longer accept new customers under our legacy product and service offerings.
Corporate Offices
 
Our principal offices are located at 325 E. Warm Springs Road, Suite 102, Las Vegas, Nevada 89119, our telephone number is (702) 939-0231, and our corporate website (which does not form part of this Form 10-K) is located at www.liveventures.com.
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2018, we had 1,155 employees, of which 703 were full-time employees, in the United States, none of whom is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
 
Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Marquis
